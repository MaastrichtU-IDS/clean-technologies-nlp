## Towards aligning EU innovation policy with climate goals: A qualitative-computational assessment of Horizon 2020 funding.

---

It's developed and applied a multi-method qualitative and computational approach to provide an assessment in the domain of climate change mitigation technologies observing public funding for multiple technologies, prioritised by the EU as mitigation technologies. The following documentation describes the development of the CleanTechTag framework.

The description and details of the computational framework and data analysis together with the data and file usage is described here: **[Data Analysis Description](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/clean-technologies-nlp/tree/master/notebooks/README.md)**
