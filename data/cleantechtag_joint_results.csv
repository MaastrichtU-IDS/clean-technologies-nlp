The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in the EU energy market, go hand in hand with a high-competitiveness of the most consolidated technologies: Wind Energy and Solar Photovoltaics. The non-dispatchable renewable generation requires a higher flexibility in the energy system, where the weight of much more decentralised installations grow day-to-day. In fact, the flourishing of a wide portfolio of renewable energy installations is allowing the deployment of large to small scale industrial electricity grids, and in an increased share of electricity produced in private households. The NAIMA project will demonstrate that the new generation of high-competitive and safety Na-Ion cells developed and tested during the project, is one of the most robust and cost-effective alternatives to unseat the current and future Li-based technologies, nowadays controlled by Asian industry. The EU cannot jeopardize the future of its stronger industry to a technology already in the hands of non-European countries. Just the availability of the raw materials of Li-ion cells is almost a “miracle”. Under this scenario, the most robust non-Lithium alternative is the technology based on Sodium-ion (Na-ion). This disruptive technology is already supported by a solid European Battery value chain (industry partners of the consortium) through their solid commitment of substantial investments in the manufacturing of all components of a battery, preserving the ownership and industry strength around European countries.

Water-based MWF, especially emulsions are susceptible to deterioration due to factors such as bacterial growth or evaporation of water which alter the fluid characteristics. In order to keep MWF properties at their optimum, additives must be used. Currently, however, testing of parameters is done either once a week using hand-held devices or using automatic systems which send information to operators alerting them to intervene. If additives are not poured in time, the MWF become unusable and need to be disposed. MWF disposal is associated with high costs of waste management and negative environmental impacts. In addition, both MWF and additives pose health risks such as skin reactions and respiratory conditions. REYS S.p.A, an expert chemical production and fluid management company has developed the Unmanned Chemical Lab (UCL), a cloud-based platform that automatically predicts fluid degradation events, remotely manages and controls process fluids reducing drastically the health exposure risk to workers. Based on an extensive database on MWF parameters and interventions taken by operators, our system has an artificial intelligence (AI) software capable to determine the amount of additives required to restore parameters to their optimum and pours the measured additives automatically. UCL novelty relies on four major pillars: (1) AI powered software enables continuous, automatic and highly accurate monitoring of the emulsion providing correction of MEW parameters in real-time; (2) usage of less than 2% fluids and additives; (3) reduce MWF disintegration by 100% enabling the fluid to last its full-service life of a year and (4) 100% reduction of health and safety operator risks associate with in situ MWF measurements.

Solar energy is by far the most abundant form of renewable energy and has the potential to partially replace fossil fuels, but its mass adoption is hindered by its weather dependency, the cost of their energy storage systems and certain environmental concerns. PRO-S® is the first flexible, semitransparent and toxic-free photonanobiotech module that uses conductive small organic molecules (proteins from bacteriorhodopsin cultivation) to produce electricity. It is an outperformer for our target markets since: 1) it is the first product capable of generating electricity and store it as hydrogen upon needs, obtaining higher efficiency in cloudy and sunny days compared to standard PV (60% and 16%, respectively); 2) it has low maintenance costs and environmental impact since no batteries are needed and is 60% recyclable; 3) it is a low cost energy source since the manufacturing is cheap (30% lower than standard PV) and independent from market fluctuations; and 4) it can be easily integrated and customized to any size. Being our first opaque PV module currently market for parking meter and table boards (eboard), our next goal is to fully develop and market a more complex and semitransparent PRO-S® module for its application as solar panel for buldings and glass windows. We will take advantage of our current partners and distributor network (from previous product eboard) to successfully deploy our improved product into the construction and building market. We plan to conduct a Feasibility Study to analyze the technical, commercial and financial viability of our advance product PRO-S® to ensure its market deployment and uptake.

WEEE plastics often contain undesired additives that hamper recycling in Europe. 75% of WEEE is currently exported to Asia where it is recycled to secondary plastics containing undesired (hazardous) substances or ending up in landfill where leaching occurs. Hence for WEEE plastics a closed loop solution is needed. 
PLAST2bCLEANED’s aim is to develop a recycling process for WEEE plastics in a technically feasible, environmentally sound and economically viable manner. To fulfil this aim, PLAST2bCLEANED addresses the recycling of the most common WEEE plastics acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) that contain up to 20wt% brominated flame retardants (BFR) and up to 5wt% of the synergist antimony trioxide (ATO). PLAST2bCLEANED will close three loops: (1) polymer, (2) bromine, and (3) ATO. 
Key technologies developed within the project are: (1) improved sorting of HIPS and ABS that contain BFR from other polystyrene and ABS fractions; (2) dissolution of WEEE plastics in superheated solvents; (3) separation of additives to concentrate BFR and ATO fractions for recycling; (4) energy efficient recovery of solvent and of polymer. The developed technology will be integrated in a pilot facility with capacity of 2 kg/hr (TRL 6) delivering polymer samples. The developed technology can be applied to similar waste streams from other sectors, e.g. automotive.

-A robust tracking device 10 times less expensive than current offerings designed to support IoT connectivity on lower-powered mobile data networks. This allows a practically maintenance free since the battery lasts up to 10 years. Besides, it is tailored to harsh environments (Rated IP67). As such, it suits applications in the waste recycling sector.

The D&D process of nuclear infrastructures demands methods for a full traceability of waste material to improve quality management and operational safety. Precise procedures provide twofold benefits: the optimization of costs, associated with D&D, and the minimization of the dose exposure to operators and personnel.
The absence of a consistent and straightforward solution to characterize all types of materials, along with the lack of an integrated solution for digitizing the enormous amount of data produced, is a critical issue. Now the systems rely on the operator’s ability to maintain high operational skills and quality assurance with precision measurements that unfortunately today very often are associating high uncertainties not allowing therefore a real optimization of the waste.
The utilization of several un-automatized instruments implies taking many notes and inserting them into specific ad-hoc format and on a database manually, without the possibility to combine data including previously available legacy data’s if present.

It is therefore at the core of many research programs all over the world. Yet, fundamental electrochemical investigations remain scarce. In particular, electrochemistry is among the fields for which the gap between theory and experiment is the largest. From the computational point of view, there is no molecular dynamics (MD) software devoted to the simulation of electrochemical systems while other fields such as biochemistry (GROMACS) or material science (LAMMPS) have dedicated tools. This is due to the difficulty of accounting for complex effects arising from (i) the degree of metallicity of the electrode (i.e. from semimetals to perfect conductors), (ii) the mutual polarization occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface and (iii) the redox reactivity through explicit electron transfers. Current understanding therefore relies on standard theories that derive from an inaccurate molecular-scale picture. My objective is to fill this gap by introducing a whole set of new methods for simulating electrochemical systems. They will be provided to the computational electrochemistry community as a cutting-edge MD software adapted to supercomputers.

Like many large wind farms, especially offshore, Raggovidda is difficult to access, in particular in winter: Haeolus will therefore deploy a remote monitoring and control system allowing the system to operate without personnel on site.

To evaluate the scientific tasks to be covered by TRANSAT, all the open issues of the tritium cycle that are not yet tackled by European research activities or former studies have been determined. This general picture has been constrained to crosscutting fusion and fission activities. 
Concerning release mechanism, tritium migration/permeation in massive samples are studied in dedicated rigs. Associated modelling takes place in the project in order to improve the level of confidence in predictive tools developed for tritium behavior in reactors. A special insight is also put in the release of tritium from tritiated particles coming from dismantling activities. Permeation barriers (active barriers and coating concepts) as well as treatment of the operational tritiated gases are assessed and their applicability to fusion and fission purposes is analyzed. Improvement in waste management is also covered by means of new concept studies for tritiated waste confining packages and by new accurate methodologies for tritium inventory assessment in metallic and soft house-keeping waste. Finally, a dedicated part of the project focuses on radiotoxicity, radioecology, radiobiology and dosimetry on tritiated particles produced during dismantling whose impacts have not yet been addressed. 18 Partners are participating in TRANSAT from all the European countries involved in tritium activities.

In this sense, ROMEO is a 5 years project whose main objective is to develop and demonstrate an O&M information management and analytics platform capable of improving the decision making processes of offshore WF operators allowing the transition from calendar base maintenance to condition-based maintenance strategies reducing significantly O&M costs. Thus, a flexible and interoperable IoT platform will provide an advanced analytics ecosystem to better understand the real time behaviour of the main components of the WTs under operation conditions; maximizing their life-time and reducing the need for maintenance, thus minimizing the OPEX which drastically impact on LCoE of offshore Wind Energy.
The project has been structured in three phases:
1st phase “specifications” will pave the way for other phases, defining the specifications and requirements in order to develop a health monitoring strategy for the most relevant and critical components to be further considered.
-nd phase “models/tools/database” will be devoted to the development of health monitoring systems, diagnosis and prognosis tools for failure detection both at WTG components and support structures level, feeding the development of a data acquisition and advanced analytics ecosystem.
3rd phase “O&M/rollout” will develop and deploy an O&M platform to be validated in three pilot scenarios, data that will serve as input for impact assessment with a special focus on LCoE and replicability.

Its performance has been validated in Europe in recent years through various demonstration projects, however, a number of actions are required to allow the commercialisation of FC buses. These include addressing the high ownership costs relative to conventional buses, ensuring the FC buses can meet the high availability levels demanded by public transport, developing the refuelling infrastructure to provide reliable, low-cost hydrogen and improving the understanding of the potential of FC buses for zero emission public transport. 
JIVE will pave the way to commercialisation by addressing these issues through the deployment of 142 fuel cell buses across 9 locations, more than doubling the number of FC buses operating in Europe. JIVE will use coordinated procurement activities to unlock the economies of scale which are required to reduce the cost of the buses. They will operate in large fleets of 10-30 buses, reducing the overhead costs per bus, as well as allowing more efficient supply chains and maintenance operations compared to previous deployments. By working at this scale and with bus OEMs with proven vehicles, JIVE will ensure reliability at the level required for commercialisation.  
JIVE will also test new hydrogen refuelling stations with the required capacity to serve fleets in excess of 20 buses. This will not only reduce the costs of hydrogen and increase the availability of equipment but will also test the ability to offer >99% reliability, which is required for the commercialisation of FC buses.

The project will provide reductions in utilization of fossil resources of 80-100%, and energy utilization and CO2 emissions above 30%.
Specifically, building blocks (1,4 and 2,3-Butanediol, estherpolyols), materials (PUs, phenolic resins, modified hydrolysis lignin) and products (wooden boards, insulation foams, cement, adhesive) will be obtained:
• Isolation of tannins and carbohydrates from forestry waste to turn them into bio-phenolic resins for wooden panels and isocyanate-free polyurethanes (PU) for insulating foams, respectively.
• Isolation of lignin and carbohydrates from agricultural waste to turn them into bio-phenolic resins for wooden panels and biosuperplasticizers for cement, and estherpolyol PU for adhesives, respectively.
• Fire retardant lignin and sugar-based additives will be also developed.
Developed processing technologies (chemo/thermo/enzymatic and fermentation) will be optimized at pilot scale (TRL6-7) for further exploitation and replication of results. All products will be integrated in a prototype to demonstrate industrial applicability into the Green Construction sector.

Nowadays, crop-based biofuels are also used with the same purposes, but consume huge water and land resources for their production.
Carbon Recycling International (CRI), founded in 2006 in Iceland, produces renewable methanol (currently 4 kt/year in the George Olah plant) from industrial CO2 emissions and Renewable Energy Sources (RES), through a novel process of clean fuel production (Vulcanol®). This proprietary technology is called Emissions–to-Liquids (ETL) and is certified ISCC Plus by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification system. While conventional production of methanol emits up to 4 t CO2/t methanol, our ETL plant fights global warming by consuming 1.4 t CO2/t of Vulcanol® produced and requires approximately 1500 times less land and up to 15,000 less water than crop based biofuel, eradicating ethical concerns about competition between biofuels and human food production. Vulcanol® is an efficient energy carrier that can be used to easily store and transport off-peak renewable energy, stabilizing the power grid and supporting expansion of RES. ETL helps to fulfil stricter EU regulations regarding the use of advanced renewable fuels and RES; improves air quality in industrial areas, thus, health of their population and employees and supports employment creation (25 skilled jobs per ETL plant). During this phase 2, CRI aims to a) scale up the technology and adapt ETL plants to economically operate with RES, b) to attract investment to build and operate ETL plants and c) to close distribution agreements for the produced Vulcanol®, which by 2024 will provide an annual profit of €95.4 million and an 8.2 years payback.",2610543.75,1827380.63,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-2,SME-2,CRI EHF,IS,,,

In line with this statement, THERMOSS proposes an industry-focused, innovation-intensive approach to ease and foster the introduction of cutting-edge heating and cooling technologies for building energy retrofitting at European level, targeting residential buildings and buildings connected to District Heating and Cooling (DHC) networks.
The aim of THERMOSS is to define a set of retrofitting heating and cooling packages based on cutting-edge, high-potential, market-ready technologies that are connected together thanks to an open ICT platform for smart energy management at building and district-level. The THERMOSS technologies have been picked out from the catalogs of prominent European industrial players, Bosch, Veolia, Exergy, Schneider Electric taking into account business profitability, energy efficiency and potential for large-scale deployment. They will be tuned, combined and sized as part of the project thanks to dedicated tools, to optimize their joint impact.

IMAGINE seeks to enable robots to understand the structure of their environment and how it is affected by its actions.  'Understanding' here means the ability of the robot (a) to determine the applicability of an action along with parameters to achieve the desired effect, and (b) to discern to what extent an action succeeded, and to infer possible causes of failure and generate recovery actions.

The core functional element is a generative model based on an association engine and a physics simulator.  'Understanding' is given by the robot's ability to predict the effects of its actions, before and during their execution.  This allows the robot to choose actions and parameters based on their simulated performance, and to monitor their progress by comparing observed to simulated behavior.

This scientific objective is pursued in the context of recycling of electromechanical appliances.  Current recycling practices do not automate disassembly, which exposes humans to hazardous materials, encourages illegal disposal, and creates significant threats to environment and health, often in third countries.  IMAGINE will develop a TRL-5 prototype that can autonomously disassemble prototypical classes of devices, generate and execute disassembly actions for unseen instances of similar devices, and recover from certain failures.  For robotic disassembly, IMAGINE will develop a multi-functional gripper capable of multiple types of manipulation without tool changes.

IMAGINE raises the ability level of robotic systems in core areas of the work programme, including adaptability, manipulation, perception, decisional autonomy, and cognitive ability.  Since only one-third of EU e-waste is currently recovered, IMAGINE addresses an area of high economical and ecological impact.

In 2012, in EU28 the electricity consumption ratio was around the 20% of the total energy consumption, from which 30% was consumed in the residential and 30% in the services sectors. From these proportions, air conditioning represents 17% of the total electricity consumption in the EU27 residential buildings. In the EU tertiary sector the electric space and water heating system represent 19.22%, the ventilation 12.47%, the commercial refrigeration 8.57% and the air conditioning 2.86% of the buildings electricity consumption. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system’s electricity consumption of a building can represent between the 30% and 40% of the total energy consumption.
The inertia of these power to heat solutions constitute an enormous potential for electric flexibility usable for absorbing the excess of renewable generation and avoiding curtailment while managing local power congestion, voltage stability in the grid and avoiding reversal power flows, as well as minimizing RES production imbalance. That is, DER with thermal inertia can provide services to RES owners, grid operators, aggregators and actors on the power market, while saving energy in the buildings. In fact, flexibility harnessing using heat to power solutions enables to deploy large-scale renewable throughout Europe successfully.
The Flexible Heat and Power (FHP) project will develop a Power-to-Heat (and Cooling) solution package that manages this complexity through an easily accessible interface aimed at buildings and power grid actors.

Electricity and transport are the largest contributors to GHG emissions; the trend in transport toward electric vehicle will increase pressure on the electricity system and fundamentally change its dynamics. With producers focused on their legitimate business targets, and consumers focused on security of supply and low prices, the burden of decarbonizing electricity falls on policy makers as driving force, and on transport system operators (TSOs) as technical managers that ensure the safety and stability of supply.
Grid stability is a delicate equilibrium, where some agents provide stability via ancillary services (regulating voltage and frequency) and others rely on that stability (consuming energy and/or disturbing the frequency due to embedded capacitors/impedances); power producers are usually stabilizers (synchronous turbines that provide inertia against sudden changes). Penetration of non-synchronous renewables such as Wind and PV threatens to disrupt the balance, especially in islands and poorly interconnected areas, as they provide power but rely on stability provided by others; this forces the system to have lots of synchronous generators idle just for stability, which is inefficient and costly.
GRIDSOL wants to change the approach: we propose Smart Renewable Hubs, where a core of synchronous generators (CSP and biogas combined cycle HYSOL) is integrated with PV under a dynamic control system (DOME), self-regulating and providing ancillary grid services thanks to firm, flexible generation on a single output, tailored to a specific location, relieving pressure on the TSO.

This means that Europe aims to transition to a largely, or fully, renewable power system. This is however not the only energy policy aim: besides a transition to renewables, further aims include an energy efficiency increase and demand reduction; liberalisation of the power markets and exposure of renewables to competition; and europeanisation of renewable energy policy, power grids, and the creation of a European internal power market. Here, I investigate whether and how these policies interact and affect the chances for and costs of a transition to a renewable power system; how the other aims constrain the options for renewables; and how policy conflicts can be resolved. Current policy discourse treats these policy aims either as independent or synergistic. My hypothesis is that they are not at all independent and that pursuing the aims of demand reduction, liberalisation and europeanisation strongly influences the transition to renewables, and that the aims are partially antagonistic, implying a need for trade-offs. The purpose of my research is to test these hypotheses and explore the policy synergies or antagonisms, by investigating yet under-researched aspects of the interactions. These include how reaching the other aims influences the transition dynamics; how key actors may alter their behaviour due to such other developments; and how reaching another policy aim impacts the stability of a fully renewable power system. I adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on transition research, engineering, political science and economics, with each perspective adding a piece of the puzzle.

The objective is to achieve a zero-waste process at a demonstration scales up to 5 ha sustainable both environmentally and economically. A Demonstration Centre of this biorefinery will be operated to demonstrate the technology, assess the operating characteristics of the system, evaluate environment impacts and collaborate with potential customers for use.
The key advantages of SABANA project are: the sustainability of the process, using marine water and recovering nutrients from wastewaters while minimizing the energy consumption, and the socioeconomic benefits, due to the relevance of the target bioproducts for two major pillars in food production as agriculture and aquaculture. Bioproducts capable of increasing the yield of crops and fish production are highly demanded, whereas recovery of nutrients is a priority issue in the EU. Instead of considering wastewater as an inevitably useless and problematic residue of our society, SABANA acknowledges its potential as an opportunity for economically relevant sectors.

• develop system components allowing reduced costs, increased durability and efficiency 
• build and validate a first 50 kW PEM prototype CHP system 
• create the required value chain from automotive manufacturers to stationary energy end-users
Mass-market production of fuel cells will be a strong factor in reducing first costs. In this respect, joining the forces of two non-competing sectors (automotive and stationary) will bring benefits to both, to increase production volume and ultimately reduce costs to make fuel cells competitive. As a consequence, the project partners have identified a PEM fuel cell based CHP concept to address the stationary power market, primarily for commercial and industrial buildings requiring an installed capacity from about 50 kWe to some hundreds of kWe. The main components of the system have been validated to at least laboratory scale (TRL>4).   As a part of the present AutoRE proposal, the overall system will be demonstrated and further validated to increase the technology readiness level to TRL5.

Lying at the interface between biophysics and nanomedicine, and based on magnetic techniques, the proposed project aims to magnetically design functional tissues and to explore the tissular fate of nanomaterials. Magnetic nanoparticles will be safely introduced into therapeutic cells, thus allowing them to be remotely manipulated by external magnets. 3D manipulations of the magnetized cells (patented in 2012) will be used to form tissues with a controlled size and shape through the development of a unique magnetic bioreactor.  In a self-integrating all-in-one process, 3D tissue will be shaped from cellular 'bricks' without the need for a scaffold. The magnetic tissue will be amenable to mechanical stimulation and in situ imaging at each step of its maturation. The project is inherently multidisciplinary:
1) From a biophysics standpoint, controlled tissue stimulation, forced cell alignment, and mapping of cell-cell forces, will be used to answer pressing questions on the role of physical stresses in cell and tissue functions, such as differentiation.
2) From a regenerative medicine standpoint, this magnetic technology will be applied to cartilage and cardiac tissue repair. The functionality of the constructs and their centimetric size range, combined with a surgeon-friendly tissue handling with a dedicated magnetic tool, and the inherent magnetic resonance imaging properties of the constructs will be major advantages for clinical translation.
3) From a nanomaterials standpoint, nanomaterial fate will be explored in situ using nanomagnetic methods, both at the tissue scale (macroscopic) and at the nanoscale. This is a necessary corollary for the use of nanomaterials in regenerative medicine, and one that is largely unexplored.'",1589000.0,1589000.0,ERC-2014-CoG,ERC-COG,UNIVERSITE PARIS DIDEROT - PARIS 7,FR,,,

Maintenance is no longer a necessary evil that costs what it costs, but an important function that creates additional value in the business process as well as new business models with a stronger service orientation. Physical systems (e.g. industrial machines, vehicles, renewable energy assets) and the environment they operate in, are monitored continuously by a broad and diverse range of intelligent sensors, resulting in massive amounts of data that characterise the usage history, operational condition, location, movement and other physical properties of those systems. These systems form part of a larger network of heterogeneous and collaborative systems (e.g. vehicle fleets or photovoltaic and windmill parks) connected via robust communication mechanisms able to operate in challenging environments. MANTIS consists of distributed processing chains that efficiently transform raw data into knowledge while minimising the need for bandwidth. Sophisticated distributed sensing and decision making functions are performed at different levels in a collaborative way, ranging from local nodes to locally optimise performance, bandwidth and maintenance; to cloud-based platforms that integrate information from diverse systems and execute distributed processing and analytics algorithms for global decision making. The research addressed in MANTIS will contribute to companies' assets availability, competitiveness, growth and sustainability.

Subsequently, the fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) is distributed to a large number of residential end-users. The FPBO should fulfill at least the draft CEN-specification for replacement of domestic heating oil and comply with REACH regulation. Additional quality control aspects for this application include the removal of extractives and solids from the FPBO.

Currently, virtually all renewable hydrocarbon fuels originate from biomass. Their feasibility to meet the global fuel demand and their environmental impact are controversial. In contrast, SUN-to-LIQUID has the potential to cover future fuel consumption as it establishes a radically different non-biomass non-fossil path to synthesize renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuels from abundant feedstocks of H2O, CO2 and solar energy. Concentrated solar radiation drives a thermochemical redox cycle, which inherently operates at high temperatures and utilizes the full solar spectrum. Thereby, it provides a thermodynamically favourable path to solar fuel production with high energy conversion efficiency and, consequently, economic competitiveness. Recently, the first-ever production of solar jet fuel has been experimentally demonstrated at laboratory scale using a solar reactor containing a ceria-based reticulated porous structure undergoing the redox cyclic process. 
SUN-to-LIQUID aims at advancing this solar fuel technology from the laboratory to the next field phase: expected key innovations include an advanced high-flux ultra-modular solar heliostat field, a 50 kW solar reactor, and optimized redox materials to produce synthesis gas that is subsequently processed to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The complete integrated fuel production chain will be experimentally validated at a pre-commercial scale and with record high energy conversion efficiency.

The charge and excited state dynamics do not only depend on the properties of individual molecules but are to a large extent determined by the interactions between multiple molecules. By careful engineering of the properties of individual molecules and of the way they aggregate in the solid crystalline state it is in principle possible to design materials that exhibit a specific functionality. Examples of this are materials that are optimized to give high charge carrier mobilities and high exciton diffusion coefficients. It is also possible to design more complex functionality. An example of this is singlet exciton fission, a process by which one singlet excited state transforms into a combination of two triplet states. This spin-allowed process can in principle increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by a factor 1.5. A second example is upconversion of low energy photons into higher energy photons. This is possible by combining two low-energy triplet excited states into a single singlet excited state by triplet-triplet annihilation. Finally, it is possible gain control over charge separation on the interface of two different materials to increase the charge separation efficiency in photovoltaic cells.

In this work, we will explore ways to achieve control of charge and exciton dynamics in a combined effort including organic synthesis, computational chemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy and conductivity experiments. This research represents a major step forward in the understanding of the relation between molecular and solid state structure and the electronic properties of organic crystalline materials.

Expanding the waste recycling is a key to construct Circular Economy (CE) approaches, contributing significantly to the global climate-change mitigation effort, at both local and national scales. Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM), of which waste recycling encompasses one part, is essential on a global scale. Innovative, low-cost methods of waste recycling was developed by vulnerable and marginalized waste pickers , which have led to the creation of an informal waste recycling sector (IRS)  which are currently being used in Brazil and others LMIC, and have the potential to be more widely deployed. The IRS has developed work procedures that diverge from those deployed in EU recycling, setting a social technology (ST). This IRS ST is beneficial to ISWM, as it diminishes overall costs and amplifies quantities recovered, besides providing income to a poor, jobless population.
This research will validate the possible gains from disseminating the Brazilian IRS ST to other LMIC countries as an ISWM policy and in support to CE strategies, which will involve a comparison of the Brazilian IRS with the EU recycling model; as such, it will consider how to make social and ecological value visible in value-analysis methods.

While the system for metals recycling is already well established, the rising volumes of waste plastics point to stalemates in the current plastics economy, which hamper its shift to a more circular model. Although there are individual efforts to improve the collection and recycling of WEEE plastics, the plastics value chain is still too fragmented and WEEE recycled plastics seem unattractive material for the end-user. To shift towards circular economy a systematic transformation is required, involving all actors in the value chain and encompassing the entire lifecycle of plastic materials.  
While substantially reducing the WEEE plastics generation and enhancing the use of recycled plastics in new applications, PolyCE will demonstrate the feasibility of circular plastics supply and value chain. In particular, PolyCE will elaborate harmonized set of technical requirements addressing the entire value chain and develop grade system for recycled plastics according to their material properties and final application suitability. Accordingly, PolyCE will strengthen the market for recycled plastics through an online platform integrating the different plastic grades. In parallel, the technical and economic feasibility as well as environmental benefits of using recycled plastics will be validated in several electronics demonstrators.

On this respect, the SMILE project will demonstrate different innovative technological and non-technological solutions in large-scale smart grid demonstration projects in the Orkneys, Samsø and Madeira islands, paving the way for their introduction in the market in the near future. The technological solutions vary from: integration of battery technology, power to heat, power to fuel, pumped hydro, electric vehicles, electricity stored on board of boats, an aggregator approach to demand side management (DSM) and predictive algorithms.
The pilots will demonstrate operation of the distribution grid under stable and secure conditions to implement solutions for demand response, intelligent control and automation of distribution networks; they have high shares of RES in the electricity grid or have planned increasing shares in the next years. All of them will demonstrate stable grid operation with use of storage solutions and smart integration of grid users from transport.
Each pilot will test the most appropriate solutions for local specificities, and common lessons with cross-cutting valence will be derived. Involving projects on islands will ease engaging residents in SMILE. Indeed, islanders are usually sensible to provide availability to test solutions impacting their daily life. Finally, two of the pilots are not total energy islands, thus representing smart grids located on the mainland and not limiting replication potential to other island locations only.

The design of such structures is still challenging but offers many perspectives for templating assemblies of desired shape and size, and for several applications ranging from optoelectronics to energy storage and biosensing. In this scope, the objectives of the proposal are structured around three main stages: (i) the chemical design of uniformly sized, hybrid magnetic/non-magnetic systems, (ii) the monitoring of the self-assembly reaction in situ using real-time measurement techniques, and (iii) the characterization of the effect of an applied external field on the morphology of the assembled structures. The chemical design methodology of the self-limiting complex particles will be investigated along with Prof. Nicholas Kotov (University of Michigan, USA) during the outgoing phase. X-ray scattering/imaging experiments yielding high spatiotemporal resolution will be performed in large-scale synchrotron facilities in the USA as well as in Europe during the return phase along with Prof. Andrei Petukhov (Utrecht University, Netherlands) with whom the effect of an applied magnetic field will be further studied. A collaboration between the two host institutes in Europe and USA will take place through this fellowship and will involve the competences of the three parties: in chemical engineering of hierarchical assemblies in solution (Prof. Kotov), in X-ray scattering/imaging for studying the self-organization of colloids (Prof. Petukhov) and in data analysis/modeling and X-ray scattering (the fellow Law-Hine).

The project will design  wireless networks, composed by smart nodes, which are able to perform the following tasks: 
	1)  Self-configure, autonomously allocating their own physical layer radio resources through energy-efficient, feedback-aware, and complexity-aware radio resource allocation.

	2)  Self-sustain by harvesting energy from renewable and intermittent energy sources, such as solar and wind, as well as from dedicated radio frequency signals present over the air.	

             3)  Sharing or trading energy with other network nodes in order to prolong the lifetime of nodes which are low on battery and to obtain a more fair energy distribution across the whole network. 
The long-term vision of the project is to kick-start a paradigm shift from core-centric, throughput-optimized networks, towards device-centric, energy-optimized networks. The development of autonomous, energy-independent, and self-organizing wireless networks will enable: 

         a) 100% coverage in urban environments in a power efficient manner;

         b) network coverage in remote/developing areas where currently it is commercially unattractive to do so. 

These advancements will make the vision of a connected society sustainable, almost zeroing the operational expenses related to power and hence revolutionizing the business models for ICT by radically reducing energy costs.

Internet applications are increasingly running on edge networks, to reduce latency, increase scalability, resilience, and security, and permit local decision making. However, today’s state of the art, the gossip and peer-to-peer models, give no solution for defining general-purpose computations on edge networks, i.e., computation with shared mutable state. LightKone will solve this problem by combining two recent advances in distributed computing, namely synchronisation-free programming and hybrid gossip algorithms, both of which are successfully used separately in industry. Together, they are a natural combination for edge computing. We will cover edge networks both with and without data center nodes, and applications focused on collaboration, computation, and both.

Currently large generators powered by fossil fuel turbines maintain the stability and quality of energy supplies through their inertia.  The inertia of these generator-turbine groups gives providers a significant time window in which to react to network events.  We urgently need to find ways to stabilise energy systems with up to 100% RES (where inertia is often lost due to power converter mediated energy transfer) to generate “RE-SERVEs” so that society can relax in the knowledge that it has a stable and sustainable energy supply.  
RE-SERVE will address this challenge by researching new energy system concepts, implemented as new system support services enabling distributed, multi-level control of the energy system using pan-European unified network connection codes.  Near real-time control of the distributed energy network will be enabled by innovative 5G based ICT.  Energy system use case scenarios supplied by energy providers will form the basis of energy system models.

For the increased biomass needed in Europe in coming years and decades we cannot rely on the most fertile lands, which is currently allocated to food production, we need to increase the yield from marginal lands. There the lupin varieties are preponderant, the one providing highest yield (up to 80 ton/ha) is Lupinus mutabilis. Varieties can be chosen for giving this high yield of green silage or high yield of seeds contain more than 20% oil, more than 40% protein and the remainder carbohydrates are mainly oligosaccharides characterized as “prebiotics”. Andes lupin can be grown as a summer crop in N-central Europe conditions and as winter crop in Mediterranean conditions.  

Breeding and cropping research is performed in the LIBBIO project for maximizing the yield and value of lupin agriculture in different European marginal lands conditions, with respect to both the farmers and biorefineries. Pre-industrial processing is developed and optimized for the lupin, properties of the different fractions analysed, their advantage for different industrial use evaluated, and a few products developed as an example. 

With respect to environmental impact the lupin is expected to be superior. It does not need much fertilizer, it enriches the soil with nitrogen and phosphate and is therefore expected to be excellent for crop rotation and soil regeneration.

landfills, predating the EU Landfill Directive of 1999. These older landfills tend to be filled with municipal solid waste
and often lack any environmental protection technology. In order to avoid future environmental and health problems,
many of these landfills will soon require expensive remediation measures. This situation might appear bleak, but it does
present us with an exciting opportunity for a combined resource-recovery and remediation strategy, which will drastically
reduce future remediation costs, reclaim valuable land, while at the same time unlocking billions of tonnes of valuable
resources contained within these landfills. However, the widespread adoption of Enhanced Landfill Mining (ELFM)
in the EU, as envisaged by NEW-MINE, urgently requires skilled scientists, engineers, economists and policy makers
who can develop cost-effective, environmentally friendly ELFM practices and regulatory frameworks. All this demands
a European commitment to concerted, inter- and transdisciplinary research and innovation. The NEW-MINE project
trains 15 early-stage researchers (ESRs) in all the aspects of landfill mining, in terms of both technological innovation
and multi-criteria assessments for ELFM. The technological innovation follows a value-chain approach, from advanced
landfill exploration, mechanical processing, plasma/solar/hybrid thermochemical conversion and upcycling, while the
multi-criteria assessment methods allow the ESRs to compare combined resource-recovery/remediation ELFM methods
with the “Do-Nothing”, “Classic remediation” and “Classic landfill mining with (co-)incineration” scenarios.

The work is strongly motivated by the global need for renewable energy sources. To this end, AMETIST framework is based on three vectors of excellence in: i) material science and epitaxial processes, ii) advanced solar cells exploiting nanophotonics concepts, and iii) new device fabrication technologies. 

Novel heterostructures (e.g. GaInNAsSb, GaNAsBi), providing absorption in a broad spectral range from 0.7 eV to 1.4 eV, will be synthesized and monolithically integrated in tandem cells with up to 8-junctions. Nanophotonic methods for light-trapping, spectral and spatial control of solar radiation will be developed to further enhance the absorption. To ensure a high long-term impact, the project will validate the use of state-of-the-art molecular-beam-epitaxy processes for fabrication of economically viable ultra-high efficiency solar cells. The ultimate efficiency target is to reach a level of 55%. This would enable to generate renewable/ecological/sustainable energy at a levelized production cost below ~7 ¢/kWh, comparable or cheaper than fossil fuels. The work will also bring a new breath of developments for more efficient space photovoltaic systems. 

AMETIST will leverage the leading position of the applicant in topical technology areas relevant for the project (i.e. epitaxy of III-N/Bi-V alloys and key achievements concerning GaInNAsSb-based tandem solar cells).

We will demonstrate the project results via production of highquality recycled PVC at TRL 5-6, reprocessing of eliminated plasticizers to new phthalate-free plasticizers and re-use of recycled polymers and additives in new flooring applications. Waste flooring will be subjected to the CreaSolv® Process, which dissolves PVC-P from the material mix and eliminates undissolved matter as well as co-dissolved plasticizers in an extractive purification step (>99%).

This ‘old PVC’ constitutes most of current hard (e.g. window frames, tubes) and soft (e.g. flooring or cables) PVC post-consumer waste. The presence of LS is a persistent barrier for PVC recycling as there are currently no economically viable solutions for their removal.
To tackle this major challenge, REMADYL will develop a breakthrough single step continuous process based on extractive extrusion technology in combination with novel solvents and melt filtration, which has the potential of rejuvenating ‘old PVC’ into REACH compliant high purity PVC tuned towards the demands of various soft and hard PVC products at market competitive cost (ca €570/ton, CAPEX and OPEX included). The process also has potential for other plastics applications, e.g. removal of (halogenated) flame retardants.
Using this process, REMADYL will demonstrate the circular use of PVC for window profiles and waterproofing sheets, providing a flagship example for the circular economy. The extracted phthalate plasticizers will be safely disposed (with energy valorisation) and the lead will be re-used in batteries.
REMADYL will deliver a breakthrough support to the Circular Economy Package and resource efficiency targets for Europe as recovered PVC will reduce incineration and landfilling. Assuming we recycle 400kton/year of ‘old PVC’ waste within 5 years after REMADYL, this will result in a reduction of ca 800ktons CO2eq and 8ktons lead emissions.

Since ≈ 20% of the EU electrical energy is used for lighting, more efficient lighting concepts need to be developed.

In future, organic LEDs (OLEDs) are predicted to become the ultimate solution, since they allow fabrication of large-area flat and flexible devices; consequently, white-emitting OLEDs (WOLEDs) are actively investigated. Current WOLEDs require the use of multiple luminophores in a single device, but this leads to imbalanced white-light emission and colour instability, due to the different stability over time of each single emitter. Moreover, the incorporation of multiple emitters increases manufacturing costs. To overcome these drawbacks, attempts have been made to generate white-emission from a single multifunctional material. However, strong limitations were faced due to the complex synthetic procedures and the inability to control the excited-state properties of the emitter and its internal energy-transfer processes. In this scenario, we propose a new strategy for easy-to-synthesize binuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, displaying dual-emission for white-light generation from a single molecular entity. The strategy involves simultaneous generation of blue and orange emission from two electronically uncoupled Ir(III) centres, linked together by a non-conjugated bridging unit. This ambitious goal can be achieved due to the mutual interaction between the Experienced Researcher (ER) and the Host Institution (HI). While the ER has a strong background in the synthesis of luminescent complexes, the HI has a consolidated expertise in organic synthesis, theoretical and experimental photophysics, and in fabrication and testing of OLED devices. This combination of competencies will guarantee the successful implementation of this project.",171473.28,171473.28,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE,IT,,,

Lead was identified by WHO as 1 of 10 chemicals of major public health concern. Urban soil is a lingering source of lead poisoning in children. Most countries have made the clean-up and restoration of the contaminated land a priority thus creating the opportunity for soil preserving remediation options. The remediation of contaminated soil is essential for the protection of environmental resources and human health. There are no effective and sustainable (soil preserving) remediation technologies for soils contaminated primarily with Pb.

These ‘coatings’ comprise functional and performance coatings and paints as well as adhesion layers. Therefore, novel triggerable smart polymer material systems and the corresponding recycling processes will be developed. The triggerable solutions will be based on smart additives (like microcapsules or microwave triggered additives) for the ‘coating’ formulations that will be activated by a specific trigger (heat, humidity, microwave, chemical). 
A continuous recycling pilot plant will demonstrate the novel DECOAT principle that allows upgrading existing mechanical recycling by adding tools for sorting by and activation of the trigger. The optimal use of the Creasolv® process for recycling of coated parts will be assessed. The focus is on recycling of the bulk material, but re-use of the coatings materials themselves will also be tackled. Using these recycling processes, circular use of demo cases for outdoor gear, household electronics and automotive parts will be validated.
The novel triggerable DECOAT technologies will create new markets for additives, coatings, paints and adhesives fulfilling the recycling need. The concepts will support designers and product developers for making ‘recyclable-by-design’ products. This will create direct business opportunities for the DECOAT partners and serve as examples for promoting DECOAT solutions to the wider stakeholder community. 
The targeted products (parts) are coated plastic from cars, electrical and electronic equipment and coated textiles which produce annually almost 3.5 million tons waste. DECOAT will lead to a decrease in landfilling of ca. 75% and a reduction in the carbon footprint by at least 30% for these products. By enabling their recycling, DECOAT is expected to generate on medium term a novel market of over 150 million in Europe (or ca 500 jobs).",5974457.5,5901707.5,H2020-NMBP-ST-IND-2018,RIA,CENTRE SCIENTIFIQUE & TECHNIQUE DE  L'INDUSTRIE TEXTILE BELGE,BE,"VAUDE SPORT GMBH & CO KG;INTERNATIONAL SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION;NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS - NTUA;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;AIMPLAS - ASOCIACION DE INVESTIGACION DE MATERIALES PLASTICOS Y CONEXAS;ECOMATTERS B.V.;INNOVATION IN RESEARCH & ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS;FUNDACION PARA LA PROMOCION DE LA INNOVACION, INVESTIGACION Y DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO EN LA INDUSTRIA DE AUTOMOCION DE GALICIA;RESCOLL;PANASONIC LIFE SOLUTIONS ELEKTRIK SANAYI VE TICARET ANONIM SIRKETI;MERCEDES-BENZ TURK AS;MAIER SCOOP;OPEN SOURCE MANAGEMENT LIMITED;C-TECH INNOVATION LIMITED;DEVAN-MICROPOLIS S.A.;IRIS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, SOCIEDAD LIMITADA",DE;AT;EL;ES;NL;BE;FR;TR;UK;PT,

Frequent exposure to odour is associated with headache, stress and respiratory problems. Odour nuisance is an indicator of larger environmental issues, such as poor waste management or polluted water. Yet, odour pollution has repeatedly been ignored in environmental regulations leaving citizens defenceless. Due to the lack of regulation, situated technical studies are rarely conducted and data and statistics on odour pollution are scarce or difficult to access. D-NOSES aims to provide a solution to this largely neglected problem by reversing the way in which odour pollution is commonly tackled. Our approach is to empower citizens with RRI, citizen science and co-creation tools to become drivers of change. D-NOSES promotes a quadruple helix model that will be applied at local, national and global levels. Through the International Odour Observatory, we will guarantee access to information in odour pollution. We will co-design citizen science interventions across 7 European and 3 non-European countries, where citizens will use innovative mapping tools to crowdsource odour issues and co-create ad-hoc solutions with CSOs, NGOs, local public authorities, odour emitting industries and academia. Advocacy actions, together with project results, such as DIY Guidelines for project replicability, scientific guidelines for policy making and The Green Paper on Odour Pollution, will be used as policy tools with the ultimate aim of introducing odour pollution in the policy agenda. A ‘Strategic Roadmap on Odour Pollution’ will pave the way for bottom-up, multi-level governance for increased sustainability in the medium to long term.

When it comes to meeting growing demands for public transport and addressing environmental issues, hydrogen fuel cell (FC) buses offer significant potential. 

A commercialisation process for FC buses is underway, through which a shared vision has been agreed between vehicle suppliers and their customers. This is based on reducing costs through scale via a phased approach of pre-commercial demonstrations that will provide the evidence for wider uptake of these vehicles in the 2020s.

The first step in upscaling FC bus deployment is underway through the JIVE project, which began in January 2017. JIVE 2 is its successor and is Europe’s most ambitious FC bus project to date: 152 buses in 14 cities across seven countries. JIVE 2 involves regions with experience of the technology scaling up fuel cell bus fleets (e.g. Cologne), and those seeking to build their knowledge and experience by demonstrating FC buses in small fleets for the first time (e.g. Auxerre, Gävleborg). All deployment locations in JIVE 2 share an ambition to increase the size of their FC bus fleets following successful initial demonstrations, hence the participating cities/regions will be natural locations for larger scale roll-out of the technology in the 2020s.

A comprehensive data monitoring and assessment exercise will capture the relevant evidence to inform next steps for the sector, and the project’s impacts will be maximised by a high-impact dissemination campaign. This will involve reaching wide audiences via various channels, including a series of international Zero Emission Bus Conferences.

In TEMPO, six innovations related to networks, digitisation thereof and building optimisation undergo final development (TRL7-8). The innovations are combined into 3 solution packages suitable for 3 different application areas:  new LT DH networks in urban areas, new LT DH networks in rural areas, and existing (HT) networks. The benefits of these solution packages to reduce network temperatures will be demonstrated in 3 selected representative demos. The Vattenfall demo is a new urban LT network whereby solution package 1 will be demonstrated to reduce temperatures and therefore to enable integration of a geothermal energy source and cooling. The Enerpipe demo is a new rural LT network whereby solution package 2 will be demonstrated to reduce temperatures and so can open up the possibility to integrate a renewable energy source at a later stage. The existing network of A2A currently operates at a very high supply temperature. By integrating solution package 3, with particular emphasis on end consumer engagement, reduction in network temperatures will be similarly demonstrated. A comparable monitoring approach will ensure optimal network performance (reliability and durability) assessment and to foster maximal replication options in other areas.

Deployment of thermal treatment in an optimised waste management lifecycle can provide significant volume reduction, waste passivation and organics destruction, with benefits for waste storage and safety cases for geological disposal. Relevant technologies include in-container vitrification, gasification, plasma treatment and hot isostatic pressing. THERAMIN aims in utilisation of all these methods.

THERAMIN will provide an EU-wide strategic review and assessment of the value of thermal technologies applicable to a broad range of waste streams (ion exchange media, soft operational wastes, sludge, organics and liquids). THERAMIN will compile an EU-wide database of thermally treatable wastes, will document the strategic benefits of thermal treatment, and will identify the opportunities, synergies, challenges, timescales and cost implications to improve radioactive waste management. THERAMIN will evaluate the applicability and achievable volume reduction of the technologies through ‘first-of-a-kind’ active and non-active full-scale demonstration tests, and will assess the disposability of residues. 

The project benefits from the large investments made by partners in thermal treatment R&D facilities, which will be used to maximise the benefit across Member states. THERAMIN will benefit from close engagement with an End User Group (waste producers and waste management organisations). The partners will encourage the mobility and training of staff for the development of the next generation of engineers and scientists, and the proposal includes a technical training workshop, a scientific conference, and use of other dissemination tools.

Both have developed new processing concepts which open new prospects for further breakthroughs leading to paradigm shift for increased performance of solar cells approaching to the practically achievable theoretical limits. In this way the costs for industrial solar module production < 0.35€/Wp and installed systems < 0.60€/Wp can be achieved, along with a reduced Capex < 0.75€/Wp for factories of >100 MW production capacity, with further scopes for cost reductions through production ramp-up.
In this project the performance of single junction CIGS solar cells will be pushed from ~21% towards 25% by a consortium with multidisciplinary expertise. The key limiting factors in state-of-the-art CIGS solar cells are the non-radiative recombination and light absorption losses. Novel concepts will overcome major recombination losses: combinations of increased carrier life time in CIGS with emitter point contacts, engineered grain boundaries for active carrier collection, shift of absorber energy bandgap, and bandgap grading for increased tolerance of potential fluctuations. Innovative approaches will be applied for light management to increase the optical path length in the CIGS absorber and combine novel emitter, front contact, and anti-reflection concepts for higher photon injection into the absorber.

This means for example based on the latest developments in Ukraine and exceptionally strong European dependency on gas from Russia, deep geothermal energy particularly based on engineered geothermal systems is becoming even more important to care for Europe`s energy security.

If deep geothermal energy from EGSs becomes a significant cornerstone in future energy strategy, there is an urgent need to provide cost-efficient and novel drilling technologies and concepts in order to open up new European geothermal reservoirs for energy exploitation.

Therefore the overall goal of ThermoDrill is the development of an innovative drilling system based on the combination of conventional rotary drilling with water jetting that will allow at least 50% faster drilling in hard rock, a cost reduction of more than 30% for the subsurface construction and a minimized risk of induced seismic activity.

In order to achieve these goals ThermoDrill will mainly address the following research and development topics:
• enhanced water jet drilling technology for borehole construction and replacement of fracking;
• HT/HP crystalline rock jetting and drilling fluids;
• systematic redesign of the overall drilling process, particularly the casing design and cementing;
• evaluation of drilling technologies and concepts in terms of HSE (health, safety and environmental) compliance.

A challenging project such as ThermoDrill can only be addressed by joint and concerted actions of outstanding experts. This means that the ThermoDrill consortium partners belong to Europe`s leading experts in the field of deep drilling technologies/designs, drilling fluids, simulation, optimal shaping of tools like rockbits, etc. The consortium is already well connected through a variety of long standing research partnerships and won’t need great efforts to adjust and synchronize quickly.",5824745.0,5380995.0,H2020-LCE-2014-1,RIA,MONTANUNIVERSITAET LEOBEN,AT,"INERCO INGENIERIA, TECNOLOGIA Y CONSULTORIA, SA;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN;GEO-ENERGIE SUISSE AG;RED DRILLING & SERVICES GMBH;SIRIUS-ES HANDELS GMBH;BESTEC GMBH;SMITH INTERNATIONAL ITALIA SPA;ES-GEOTHERMIE",ES;DE;CH;AT;IT;FR,

This efficiency can be greatly improved through the recycling of spent fuel (as done today in France for instance), including, in the longer term, multi-recycling strategies to be deployed in fast reactors. In this context, GENIORS addresses research and innovation in fuel cycle chemistry and physics for the optimisation of fuel design in line with the strategic research and innovation agenda and deployment strategy of SNETP, notably of its ESNII component. GENIORS focuses on reprocessing and fuel manufacture of MOX fuel potentially containing minor actinides, which would be reference fuel for the ASTRID and ALFREDO demonstrators.
More specifically, GENIORS will carry out research and innovation for developing compatible techniques for dissolution, reprocessing and manufacturing of innovative oxide fuels, potentially containing minor actinides, in a “fuel to fuel” approach taking into account safety issues under normal and mal-operation. It also considers the impacts of these strategies on the interim storage. For delivering a full picture of a MOX fuel cycle, GENIORS will work in close collaboration with the INSPYRE project on oxide fuels performance.
By implementing a three step approach (reinforcement of the scientific knowledge => process development and testing => system studies, safety and integration), GENIORS will lead to the provision of more science-based strategies for nuclear fuel management in the EU.
It will allow nuclear energy to contribute significantly to EU energy independence. In the longer term, it will facilitate the management of ultimate radioactive waste by reducing its volume and radio-toxicity.

Functions relating to agriculture include: primary productivity, water regulation & purification, carbon-sequestration & regulation, habitat for biodiversity and nutrient provision & cycling. Trade-offs between these functions may occur: for example, management aimed at maximising primary production may inadvertently affect the ‘water purification’ or ‘habitat’ functions. This has led to conflicting management recommendations and policy initiatives. There is now an urgent need to develop a coherent scientific and practical framework for the sustainable management of soils.
LANDMARK will uniquely respond to the breadth of this challenge by delivering (through multi-actor development):
1. LOCAL SCALE: A toolkit for farmers with cost-effective, practical measures for sustainable (and context specific) soil management.
2. REGIONAL SCALE - A blueprint for a soil monitoring scheme, using harmonised indicators: this will facilitate the assessment of soil functions for different soil types and land-uses for all major EU climatic zones.
3. EU SCALE – An assessment of EU policy instruments for incentivising sustainable land management.

There are different good quality methodologies and guidelines available. However, currently municipalities struggle to implement these action plans. There are different reasons for that; one of the most important is the fact that often municipal employees do not feel engaged and are not motivated to take any sort of actions and initiatives, unless someone has actually “obliged” them. In many cases, this lack of engagement and commitment ends up with investments in energy efficiency that do not deliver expected technical and economic outcomes. Hence, the energy efficiency potential is not fully exploited and worse suboptimal investments do not provide expected yields. Moreover, local authorities (LAs) more often are facing also challenges regarding climate resilient infrastructure and climate adaptation. The level of knowledge and understanding is even scarcer as regarding climate mitigation. 
COMPETE4SECAP is designed to deliver a systematic approach to energy savings in local authorities using energy management systems (EnMS) according to ISO 50001 or European Energy Award with dedicated online monitoring tool and energy saving competitions. EnMS and competitions when combined can trigger significant benefits by providing innovative and efficient way to involve municipalities that have already their SEAPs but do not act in order to foster their integrated development at local level. Trained and engaged municipal employees will be able to better implement energy efficiency projects, which then require higher investments. An EnMS will help the LA to have reliable data for informed decision and further help in monitoring and evaluation of implemented projects.

As a consequence, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Utilities are investigating new strategies and technologies for power flexibility. On the other hand, existing cogenerative CCs are usually constrained by thermal user demand, hence can provide limited services to the grid. At the same time, CHP plants are highly promoted for their high rate of energy efficiency (> 90%) and combined with district heating network are a pillar of the EU energy strategy.
To un-tap such unexploited reserve of flexibility, and to further enhance turn-down ratio and power ramp capabilities of power oriented CCs, this project proposes the demonstration of an innovative concept based on the coupling of a fast-cycling highly efficient heat pump (HP) with CCs. The integrated system features thermal storage and advanced control concept for smart scheduling. The HP will include an innovative expander to increase the overall efficiency of the HP. In such an integrated concept, the following advantages are obtained: 
- the HP is controlled to modulate power in order to cope with the CC primary reserve market constraints;
- the high temperature heat can be exploited in the district heating network, when available; low temperature cooling power can be used for gas turbine inlet cooling or for steam condenser cooling, thus reducing the water consumption;
- in both options, the original CC operational envelope is significantly expanded and additional power flexibility is achieved.

In Arkyne Technologies S.L we defend that the climate change imperative dictates that we begin the transformation of our energy system right now just within our homes and businesses! We base our disruptive product within one of the latterly alternative energy sources proposed, Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC), which use special microorganisms’ properties in an anaerobic anode compartment for production of bio-electricity.  
With BIOO we are exploiting the Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell (PMFC), which is characterised by the fact that the generation of such electricity is done by means of anaerobic bacteriological synthesis of the organic matter produced during plants’ photosynthesis. The introduction of BIOO panel into the market will have a positive impact on: i) the environment, by means of creating the greenest electricity ever, ii) the economy of our customers, by allowing them to obtain enough electricity for residential use at lower pay-backs than competitors and finally, iii) Arkyne Technologies’ economic growth, assuring an accumulated turnover during 4 year period around 13.2M€.  We are applying to the SME Instrument in order to obtain funding to carry out the technical and commercial activities required to obtain a marketable and ready to certify BIOO Panel system, as well as to create a demonstrative platform useful to act as a show-room for our clients.

The range of products to be launched on the market in February 2020 comprises of two different sized turbine devices, 25Kw and 60Kw respectively, which are specifically designed to cater to a niche, ‘low-power’, small-scale energy generation market.

DP Renewables stems from the success of ‘HydroKinetic-25’, the SME Instrument Phase 1 project implemented by DesignPro in March-September 2016 that served to prove this innovative idea’s economic viability and define a business plan to bring it to market. Phase 2 will see this strategic and validated business plan implemented and the realisation of a project that will have significant positive impact on societal, economic and environmental issues. The project will cater to those with a suitable deployment site, meeting their need for energy security and independence, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions. 

The project is fully aligned with the growth strategy of the SME and is regarded as a major stepping-stone towards consolidating its international presence while becoming a recognised contributor to the renewable energy spectrum. Despite its large resource potential, hydrokinetic energy is still largely untapped with only 5% exploited to date. Europe, as well as many countries around the world, is rich of small and medium-sized rivers and straits between islands. Existing technologies require very fast flow speeds and large deployment spaces in order to make turbine outputs viable.

More than 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced per year in the EU28 being recycled only 29.7%. This represents a clear loose in the plastic market loop (losses of €10.56bn). Moreover, this goes against the EU legislation on waste (high environmental impact; 23.8 Mt of CO2). 
Low recycling rates of plastic are mainly due to the situation of packaging waste (i.e. main plastic waste fraction), since it is mainly domestic residue and consequently the quality of the material collected depends on the system of segregation available and the environmental awareness of citizens.

PlastiCircle aims to develop and implement a holistic process to increase recycling rates of packaging waste in Europe. This will allow to reprocess again plastic waste in the same value chain (i.e. Circular economy; closure of plastic loop). This process is based on four axes: collection (to increase quantity of packaging collected), transport (to reduce costs of recovered plastic), sorting (to increase quality of recovered plastic), and valorization in value-added products (i.e. foam boards, automotive parts like engine covers/bumpers/dashboards, bituminous roofing membranes, garbage bags, asphalt sheets/roofing felts and urban furniture like fences/benches/protection walls). 

The target is to increase collection from 81.7% to 87% and valorization in a 9.8%. The implementation of PlastiCircle approach in Europe have the potential to increase collected plastic in 861,250t (reaching 14.14 Mt) and valorization in 1.59Mt. The valorization of this new material, represents a market value of €2.86bn-€7.95bn. Taking into account current figures of the plastic sector (turnover €350bn, 62,000 companies, 1.45M employees), this could imply creation of 500-1400 new companies and the generation of 11,900-33,000 new jobs in the medium to long term if PlastiCircle approach is extended in a EU level.",8674540.89,7774016.75,H2020-CIRC-2016TwoStage,IA,"INSTITUTO TECNOLOGICO DEL EMBALAJE, TRANSPORTE Y LOGISTICA",ES,"MESTNA OBCINA VELENJE;POLARIS M HOLDING SRL;INDUSTRIAS TERMOPLASTICAS VALENCIANAS, S.A.;GEMEENTE UTRECHT;FUNDACION DE LA COMUNITAT VALENCIANA PARA LA PROMOCION ESTRATEGICA EL DESARROLLO Y LA INNOVACION URBANA;Imperbel N.V.;Armacell Benelux S.A.;CENTRO RICERCHE FIAT SCPA;STIFTELSEN SINTEF;CONSORZIO PER LA PROMOZIONE DELLA CULTURA PLASTICA PROPLAST;ECOEMBALAJES ESPANA, S.A.;PICVISA MACHINE VISION SYSTEMS SL;SINTEF AS;AXION RECYCLING LTD;ICLEI EUROPEAN SECRETARIAT GMBH (ICLEI EUROPASEKRETARIAT GMBH);PLASTICSEUROPE;HAHN PLASTICS LTD;MUNICIPALITY OF ALBA IULIA;Fundacio Knowledge Innovation Market Barcelona;SOCIEDAD ANONIMA AGRICULTORES DE LAVEGA DE VALENCIA",SI;RO;ES;NL;BE;IT;NO;UK;DE,

The project will not only produce a nitrates and phosphate concentrate available for use as organic fertiliser in agriculture, but its novelty rests on the use of an innovative fermentative process designed for sludge valorisation which results in a hydrolysed sludge (with a multiplied Biomethane Potential) and biostimultants products, with low development costs and high added value in plant nutrition and agriculture.
This process is complemented by proven technologies such as biological aeration systems, membrane technologies, anaerobic processes for bio-methane production and algal technologies, all combined in a zero-waste-emission and an integrated monitoring control tool that will improve the quality of data on nutrient flows. The project will close the loop by demonstrating the benefits associated with nutrients recycling through the implementation of different business models for each final product.

As a summary, Water2REturn project adopts a Circular Economy approach where nutrients present in wastewaters from the meat industry can be recycled and injected back into the agricultural system as new raw materials.

1 – Resource assessment at two unconventional geothermal sites, for EGS development at Acoculco and for a super-hot resource near Los Humeros. This part will focus on understanding the tectonic evolution, the fracture distribution and hydrogeology of the respective region, and on predicting in-situ stresses and temperatures at depth. 
2 – Reservoir characterization using techniques and approaches developed at conventional geothermal sites, including novel geophysical and geological methods to be tested and refined for their application at the two project sites: passive seismic data will be used to apply ambient noise correlation methods, and to study anisotropy by coupling surface and volume waves; newly collected electromagnetic data will be used for joint inversion with the seismic data. For the interpretation of these data, high-pressure/ high-temperature laboratory experiments will be performed to derive the parameters determined on rock samples from Mexico or equivalent materials. 
3 – Concepts for Site Development: all existing and newly collected information will be applied to define drill paths, to recommend a design for well completion including suitable material selection, and to investigate optimum stimulation and operation procedures for safe and economic exploitation with control of undesired side effects. These steps will include appropriate measures and recommendations for public acceptance and outreach as well as for the monitoring and control of environmental impact.

This reversal is due to the Dec. 2017 Chinese import ban on plastic waste. Moreover, the regulatory pressure on plastic recycling is increasing: in May 2019 the EU and most other states signed an agreement, which classifies plastic waste as hazardous, greatly reducing the capabilities of EU member states to export plastic waste to the third world and, hence, requiring treatment within the EU. In summary, the burden of dealing with plastic waste will shift back to Europe, the US, Canada and Japan presenting a large, global business opportunity for Composite Recycling Ltd (CRL).

Product & value proposition: CRL owns the patent to turn plastics waste into synthetic oil by treatment with molten zinc. This innovation named SynOil delivers highly profitable plastic waste incl. non-recyclable plastics to synthetic oil plants as SynOil is the fastest possible solution to treat plastic wastes due to heat transfer.

Target-users of SynOil are plastic waste recyclers, municipals and industrial plastic waste producers worldwide.

Market size: Worldwide about 100 SynOil plants are required. The financial returns for an operator are excellent with IRR’s over 25%depending mainly on throughput, but also local market conditions and other factors.

The next step in the SynOil project is the demonstrator scale unit – followed by commercialization. The funding requirement for the demonstration stage is between €1.5 and 8.0 million. The higher figure of €8.0 million is for the special case of a commercial plant for large plastic pieces.

Company: CRL was founded in 2012 to commercialize our waste tyre and printed circuit boards (PCBs) recycling processes. SynOil – waste plastic to oil or diesel – is yet another pillar in our growth strategy.

Business model & commercialization: CRL will use the licence and design business model to commercialize SynOil.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,COMPOSITE RECYCLING LIMITED,IE,,,

Amazonia also features prominently in global climate, carbon, and vegetation models, which assume tropical forests are effectively pristine and that past human disturbance mimicked natural processes. It is now evident that recurrent human disturbance of Amazonia, like fire and deforestation, were significant in some areas. Since those disturbances likely modify subsequent vegetation dynamics - including temporarily increasing forest capacity to absorb carbon - the emerging paradigm of human disturbance is a challenge to global ecological understanding. The focus of my project is thus to reliably determine whether human disturbances occurred in locations that form the basis of global models. A key expected outcome is to either legitimize or force revision to these models of carbon sequestration potential in Amazonia.

I will innovatively integrate ecological, paleoecological, archaeological, chemical and biogeographic analyses to assess the degree to which past human disturbance drives the diversity patterns and carbon dynamics observed in modern Amazonian forests. For key long-term sites across Amazonia, I will quantify the: i) time since the last fire, ii) past fire frequency, extent and intensity, iii) past vegetation change in the presence and absence of human activity, and iv) continuity of past human activity over the last 1000 years. My results will provide the first quantification of local-scale recovery processes exceeding 100 years in tropical forests, and will determine if observed forest dynamics are driven by disturbances that occurred before modern ecological surveys began.

The wave power industry has suffered high-profile failures since many devices were unable to withstand the tough ocean environments. Eco Wave Power has developed an innovative Wave Energy Convertor (WEC), designed to operate nearshore or effectively onshore: most of the system is located on land with only floaters and pistons positioned in the water. And it is designed to capture the type and size of waves which are typical at the shore. The unique design results insignificantly reduced costs for installation and
operation. And most of the parts are standard equipment which is easily available. The WEC promises to deliver electricity at a LCOE of between €50 and €EUR90, when operating at scale. The device is entirely modular and will ultimately be produced in units of 1MW. It incorporates innovative protection methods which are deployed in the event of storms: the WEC automatically recognizes the particular wave type, alerting the system to either raise the floaters above the water level or submerse them for protection. EWP installed a 100 kW EWP system (1:10 scale) in Gibraltar, in 2016 through an EU Regional Development Fund project. It is performing in accordance with expectations and is already selling energy to the Gibraltar grid. Eco Wave Power aims to scale the device to 1MW and has a PPA agreement in place with the Gibraltar Government to deliver the power generated in the future. The company has letters of intent from a further 12 customers, in Europe and across the world, for additional installations, ranging from 1MW to 50MW. Eco Wave Power aims to roll out through SPVs and a ‘Build-Own-Operate’ model initially – and to sell its WEC directly, or through license to third parties, in the longer term. EWP aims to develop its business plan to go to market through the Phase 1 project and envisages a further Phase 2 project to take its technology to full scale.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,ECO WAVE POWER LTD,IL,,,

To achieve this, the HighLite project focuses on thin (down to 100 µm) high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells with passivating contacts and capitalizes on the learnings from previous large funded projects. In HighLite, a unique consortium of experienced industrial actors and leading institutes will work collectively to develop, optimize, and bring to high technology readiness levels (TRL 6-7) innovative solutions at both cell and module levels. In practice, HighLite will demonstrate high-efficiency ¼ size (or smaller) cut solar cells (silicon heterojunction cells with efficiency η ≥ 23.3%, interdigated back-contact cells with η ≥ 24.3%; only 0.2% less than full size cells) in pilot-line manufacturing. Industrial tools will be developed in the project for assembling these cut-cells into high-efficiency modules tailored for various distributed generation (DG) applications. More specifically, the following developments will take place: (1) building-applied PV modules with η ≥ 22% and a carbon footprint ≤ 250 kg-eq.CO2/kWp, (2) building-integrated PV modules with η ≥ 21% and improved shading tolerance, and (3) 3D-curved vehicle-integrated PV modules with η ≥ 20% and a weight ≤ 5 kg/m2. Finally, HighLite aims to show improved cost and performance (both through indoor testing and outdoor demonstrators) against state-of-the-art commercially available modules. Altogether, it is expected that the solutions developed in HighLite will: (1) create more demand in Europe and worldwide for such DG products, (2) significantly improve the competitiveness of industrial actors that are part of the consortium, and (3) trigger significant investment in the EU PV industry.",15119008.75,12870478.25,H2020-LC-SC3-2019-RES-IA-CSA,IA,INTERUNIVERSITAIR MICRO-ELECTRONICA CENTRUM,BE,UAB SOLI TEK R&D;CSEM CENTRE SUISSE D'ELECTRONIQUE ET DE MICROTECHNIQUE SA - RECHERCHE ET DEVELOPPEMENT;INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ENERGY RESEARCHCENTER KONSTANZ ISC EV;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES;ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE;PI PHOTOVOLTAIK-INSTITUT BERLIN AG;HENKEL ELECTRONIC MATERIALS BELGIUMNV;INSTITUT FUR SOLARENERGIEFORSCHUNG GMBH;APPLIED MATERIALS ITALIA SRL;VOLTEC SOLAR;3D-Micromac AG;VALOE OYJ;ION BEAM SERVICES;ISSOL SA;UNIVERZA V LJUBLJANI,LT;CH;DE;NL;FR;BE;IT;FI;SI,

By optimising usage of bio-based fertilisers (BBF) from side-streams, ensuring their safety, building evidence-based trust in their usage and developing legislative framework for their use, it will be possible to reduce dependence upon mineral/fossil fertilisers, benefiting the environment and the EU’s economy.

LEX4BIO aims to achieve this by collecting and processing regional nutrient stock, flow, surplus and deficiency data, and reviewing and assessing the required technological solutions. Furthermore, socioeconomic benefits and limitations to increase substitution of mineral fertiliser for BBFs will be analysed. A key result of LEX4BIO will be a universal, science-based toolkit for optimising the use of BBFs in agriculture and to assess their environmental impact in terms of non-renewable energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and other LCA impact categories. LEX4BIO provides for the first time connection between production technologies of BBFs and regional requirements for the safe use of BBFs.

The large variation between EU regions in nutrient flows and regional requirements for fertilisers will be estimated by harmonised methods to produce the knowledge basis needed to set up feasible ways to redirect the nutrient flows where needed. This will be followed by classifying the best available technologies for producing regionally tailored BBFs to secure high agricultural productivity, as well as environmental protection, food safety and human health.

-	People: we create social awareness through a participatory monitoring approach. We target social vulnerable groups by providing treatment solutions for open drains. We create a community of practitioners by the establishment of open innovation test sites and a training & learning network.
-	Planet: we focus on rejuvenation of the river by removing organic pollution, heavy metals and emerging compounds that have the biggest impact on Indian streams. We provide technology innovations to upgrade existing wastewater infrastructure and to add treatment systems to open drains, resulting in improved quality of receiving rivers.
-	Profit: we apply the principles of the Circular Economy and exploit the economic opportunities of waste-to-energy, water reuse and resource recovery. Solutions are cost efficient and require limited investments making them particularly suited for the Indian market.
In collaboration with local stakeholders and supported by industrial partners we will set-up two pilot sites at the Barapullah Drain (New Delhi) and the Jajmau plant (Kanpur).

One aspect of batteries that has received little attention so far, is the form factor of the electrodes. However, simple changes in the battery architecture, such as increasing the coating thickness, allows to drastically decrease the relative fraction of dead volume in the battery (e.g. separators and current collectors). Theoretically, it is possible to replace a stack of ten standard 50 µm thick electrode coatings by one 500 µm thick coating. This would result in up to 30% savings in weight as well as volume of the battery, and would be transformative for both portable electronics and electrical vehicles. However, this is fundamentally challenging because of 1) slow ion diffusion through thick electrodes, 2) high electric resistance through the thickness of the electrode, and 3) cracking and flaking challenges during the fabrication of thick electrodes. 
This MSCA Fellowship is building on novel gel electrodes developed by the applicant, which can be moulded into 3D geometries that allow to move away from the current flat battery morphology and to address the above challenges with thick battery electrodes. During this Fellowship, the dynamics of ion and electron transport in thick 3D interdigitated electrodes will first be simulated. Then, the electrochemical performance of the gels will be optimised, in particular, a phase separation method to improve Li-diffusion will be optimised. Next, the thermal moulding process will be optimised to create interdigitated electrodes which will be tested in half and full cells. Finally, the proposed fabrication process will be demonstrated on a roll-to-roll coater, which is important to prove its scalability to industrial stakeholders.",224933.76,224933.76,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARSOF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,UK,,,

Good regional practices have the potential to serve as good practice examples for other regions. So far, however, results of existing studies and good practices have not been effective enough in supporting the implementation of better-performing systems elsewhere. The main objective of the COLLECTORS project is to overcome this situation and to support decision-makers in shifting to better-performing collection system.

COLLECTORS will therefore: 

(1) Increase awareness of the collection potential by compiling, harmonizing and presenting information on systems for packaging and paper waste, WEEE and construction products via an online information platform.
(2) Improve decision-making on waste collection by the assessment of twelve good practices on their performance on: (1) quality of collected waste; (2) economics; (3) environment; (4) societal acceptance. 
(3) Stimulate successful implementation by capacity-building and policy support methods that will increase the technical and operational expertise of decision-makers on waste collection.
(4) Engage citizens, decision-makers and other stakeholders throughout the project for validation of project results and to ensure the usability of COLLECTORS-output.

Plastic materials that leak into the environment are a global pollution problem as they may take up to 2.000 years to degrade. The European Parliament agreed on measures to eliminate single-use plastics by 2030 as part of the EU Plastics Strategy. We have to be aware about the need to shift our industry and the use of biodegradable bioplastics. A potential solution are PHA bioplastics, biodegradable and produced by bacteria. Unfortunately, because of their costly production process, currently marketed PHA (5-20€/kg) cannot compete with conventional plastics (1-2€/kg)
VEnvirotech Biotechnology is a biotechnology start-up founded in April 2018 aiming to offer a solution to the plastic problem by transform organic waste into biodegradable PHA bioplastics while using bacteria. Our innovation relies on the application of biotechnology to organic waste treatment processes at industrial scale to obtain a revalorized product in the form of bioplastic. We have developed two processes: a waste treatment process that uses bacteria to digest organic waste from industrial companies. By inducing feeding and famine cycles to bacteria with the grinded and fermented organic waste, bacteria accumulate PHA bioplastic as energy reserve. This selective pressure process is repeated in our VE-Box a portable processing plant capable of producing high quality PHA biodegradable bioplastics as added-value from organic waste. The bacteria with PHA is taken from the VE-Box to VEnvirotech’s centralized plants to extract, purify and formulate our VE-0plastic.
We can reduce by 30% the costs of waste management and by 50% the price of bioplastic. The opportunity in the global waste management market and bioplastics market represents a combined TAM of €447B by 2024.

Lignin, a complex biopolymer that is rich in aromatic rings, can serve as a renewable source for aromatic base chemicals. Significant advances towards the depolymerization of lignin now give access to a plethora of small aromatic compounds with a variety of valuable functional groups. However, current catalyst systems are unable to convert these compounds into aromatic building blocks without loss of these desirable functional groups. Hence, there is a need for the development of new catalysts that are capable of handling these oxygen-rich materials that are derived from biomass.

The objective of the proposed research is to develop novel bimetallic base metal catalysts for the conversion of lignin-derived compounds into aromatic building blocks. These bimetallic catalysts will be designed to specifically target the robust aromatic C-O ether bonds that are present in lignin-derived compounds. I will synthesize new ligand frameworks that can host two low-valent base metals, which strongly bind and activate aromatics. In contrast to conventional homogeneous catalysts, the envisioned catalysts will have active sites in close proximity to each other, enabling cooperative making and breaking of chemical bonds by multiple metal centers. The tunable nature of these ligands will enable obtaining detailed understanding on how to facilitate the bottleneck oxidative addition of aryl-ethers. 

The development of new catalytic methodologies that allow valorization of highly oxygenated biomass-derived compounds is essential to decrease our dependence on fossil resources. This research will fundamentally advance understanding of how multiple metals can activate strong chemical bonds, which will be employed to develop catalysts that use lignin-derived compounds for the synthesis of valuable aromatic building blocks.",187572.48,187572.48,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-RI,UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT,NL,,,

It is a time-critical condition with survival chances decreasing by 10% with every minute of delay from collapse to defibrillation. Currently, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatchers use guidelines to recognise OHCA during emergency calls prior to activating the emergency response system. EMS are struggling as emergency calls have increased in Europe from 100 million calls in 2003 to 320 million in 2016. Thus, assistant decision tools will be necessary to help EMS to faster identify OHCA situations.

Our solution, AI4EMS, is the first and only smart digital assistant for EMS dispatchers that supports the triage decision-making by: 1) processing and analysing emergency calls in real-time; 2) recognising OHCA in an evidence-based process from large amounts of historical data (unfeasible to humans); and 3) presenting the most important insights to the EMS dispatcher in a user friendly manner. AI4EMS allows for faster (reducing almost 3 minutes on average) and more accurate (increase from 73.9% human accuracy to 95%) OHCA recognition by leveraging advanced speech analytics and AI. We offer a user-friendly and secure SaaS solution capable of communicating using Natural Language, accessed via a Nvidia TX1-based device.  We are directly supporting the eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020 and Digital Single Market (DSM) strategies, by providing a disruptive ICT technology to improve EMS dispatch efficiency and triage accuracy – which will impact the economy and society at large.

With the upgrade and commercialisation of AI4EMS we will disrupt the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market for healthcare taking a step further on our goal to become world leaders in EMS artificial intelligence.

The current increase in energy demands across the world makes fossil-fuel based energy resources unsustainable. Research and Innovation on finding, developing and enhancing green energy sources are crucial to achieve the EU aim to obtain 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Thermoelectric (TE) energy conversion is one alternative to produce green renewable energy by converting heat into electrical energy. However, the efficiency of current TE technology is poor and limiting its usage. Entering the nanoscale, promises to overcome the problem of low efficiency but require also novel theories describing correctly TE phenomena at the quantum level. This Marie Słodowska-Curie action, called “Development of a new first-principle Framework for Quantum Thermoelectricity — Application to 2D materials” (QTherm-2D), aims at exploring and advancing the emergence of thermoelectricity at the nanoscale, where quantum effects dominate. QTherm-2D will overcome the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods and go beyond by developing a novel transport theory for the investigation of TE energy conversion in realistic nanodevices. This will provide a theoretical framework capable of making groundbreaking predictions for high-efficient TE devices and heat-dissipating materials. This original formalism will then be applied together with state-of-the-art methods to address fundamental issues related to the emergence of quantum thermoelectricity and to explore 2D materials for TE applications.

The development and demonstration of the PTO for a 1MW OWSC device is based on multiple hardware innovations (modular design, twin drive trains, intelligent cylinders, standardized central power unit and novel accumulator arrangement) and software innovations (wave-by-wave damping control, advanced efficiency control, energy storage control, power smoothing and prediction). The project will therefore generate extensive know-how in the area of PTO design and PTO control systems, with the aim to decrease the LCOE of next generation OWSC devices below €150/MWh. The methodologies used in the project (such as wave-by-wave damping control and prediction, standardized power units) will be applicable to many other Wave Energy Converter types and generate new standards (algorithms) for PTO control, thus benefiting the broader ocean energy community. The full-scale PTO will be validated in a PTO test rig available at AW-Energy in Finland, a facility allowing the consortium to create power matrices for the wave conditions of different sites, fine-tune the PTO control algorithms, certify the operation of the PTO and ensure that the produced electricity conforms to the various grid codes of different market areas.

Relying on district heating systems for heat generation is the most effective solution in densely populated areas. However, many district heating systems (DHS) are highly energy inefficient and need to be modernized. Considering that the predominant energy sources used are still fossil fuels (oil, gas or coal) makes interventions ever more urgent. Both statements hold especially for East European countries where old, inefficient district heating systems, mostly fueled by fossil sources, urgently need to be modernized. 

The unique feature of KeepWarm is its combination of concrete work at pilot systems and its close alignment with national and European multipliers to disseminate this experience broadly. The latter incudes close interaction with potential investors and fund managers to increase the likelihood that KeepWarm business plans receive the necessary funding. The project promotes EU goals of improved and environmental friendly heating and cooling but adapts its exploitation strategy to distinct national windows of opportunities.

This project establishes a laboratory experimental study to determine the performance of clay mixed with construction and biomass plant waste (fine recycled aggregates, FRA, and/or biomass bottom ashes, BBA) as materials for the enhanced attenuation of contaminants in landfill leachate. The aim is to (1) evaluate the contaminant attenuation capacity of these mixtures for different conditions, (2) develop design guidelines to construct barriers for waste containment systems and similar applications, and (3) interpret their performance using numerical modelling tools. Column experiments where landfill leachate is passed through different waste:clay mixtures will be run in a state-of-the-art centrifuge facility which simulates realistic times, pressures and temperatures of landfill field conditions. The geochemistry of the column pore water and material residues after permeation with leachate will be examined to deduce the processes responsible for pollutant removal and retention. After permeation with landfill leachate, the effects of exposure of these barriers to an aggressive acid environment, rainfall infiltration and rising water table will be studied. The concept will be applicable for barrier design at other waste disposal facilities. The results will provide a novel and timely improvement which addresses the problem of managing the vast amounts of industrial residues such as FRA and BBA. Instead of disposal these will be re-used/recycled as an additive in host clay for building contaminant barriers, thus also conserving natural resources (clay and other man-made barrier materials).

CPS are characterised by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. A common downside to CPS complexity and openness is a large attack surface and a high degree of dynamism that may lead to complex failures and irreparable physical damage. The legitimate fear of security or functional safety vulnerabilities in CPS results in arduous testing and certification processes. Once fielded, many CPS suffer from the motto: never change a running system.
certMILS increases the economic efficiency and European competitiveness of CPS development, while demonstrating the effectiveness of safety & security certification of composable systems.
The project employs a security-by-design concept originating from the avionics industry: Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS), which targets controlled information flow and resource usage amongst software applications. certMILS reduces certification complexity, promotes re-use, and enables secure updates to CPS throughout its life-cycle by providing certified separation of applications, i.e. if an application within a complex CPS fails or starts acting maliciously, other applications are unaffected.
Security certification of complex systems to medium-high assurance levels is not solved today. The existing monolithic approaches cannot cope with the complexity of modern CPS. certMILS uses ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 62443 to develop and applies a compositional security certification methodology to complex composable safety-critical systems operating in constantly evolving hostile environments. certMILS core results are standardised in a protection profile.certMILS develops three composable industrial CPS pilots (smart grid, railway, subway), certifies security of critical re-useable components, and ensures security certification for the pilots by certification labs in three EU countries with involvement of the authorities.",5616543.75,3999055.63,H2020-DS-LEIT-2016,IA,TECHNIKON FORSCHUNGS- UND PLANUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH,AT,"SYSGO SRO;DEKRA TESTING AND CERTIFICATION SAU;ATSEC INFORMATION SECURITY GMBH;SYSGO GMBH;SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC ESPANA SA;Q-MEDIA, S.R.O.;ELEKTROTECHNICKY ZKUSEBNI USTAV, SP;THALES AUSTRIA GMBH;UNICONTROLS A.S.;UNIVERSITAET ROSTOCK;EPOCHE AND ESPRI SLU",CZ;ES;DE;AT,

In this scenario, recycling CO2 by converting it into useful chemicals, such as fuels for transportation, represents an important research area as it will eventually lead to independence from fossil fuels and petroleum. While much progress has been made, this emerging field is challenged by huge technical and scientific questions. The intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the CO2 molecule, combined with slow multi-electron transfer kinetics, makes its reduction exceedingly energetically demanding. Hy-Cat aims to develop novel material platforms to investigate different chemical paths that promote electrochemical CO2 reduction and direct product selectivity. We will synthesize hybrid materials comprising atomically defined CO2 sorbents and nanocrystalline CO2 catalysts intimately bound in a single integrated system. Three different classes of hybrids, each characterized by one specific absorption/pre-activation mechanism, will allow to investigate the effect of each mechanism on the catalyst activity. A key component of the research will be to develop synthetic schemes to access these multifunctional systems with an unprecedented level of control across multiple lengthscales. This control and the intrinsic tunability of the chosen building blocks will allow us to methodically compare structure and activity, so to determine the design principles upon which better catalysts can be made. We will argue that this understanding is required to remove the main bottlenecks towards efficient and selective catalysts to convert CO2 into useful products, such hydrocarbons.

The underlying concept of the proposal is the Smart Zero Carbon City concept, where city carbon footprint and energy demand are kept to a minimum through the use of demand control technologies that save energy and promote raised awareness; energy supply is entirely renewable and clean; and local energy resources are intelligently managed by aware citizens, as well as coordinated public and private stakeholders.
This approach will be firstly defined in detail, laid out and implemented in the three Lighthouse demonstrators (Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain, Tartu in Estonia and Sonderborg in Denmark). The three cities will develop a number of coordinated actions aimed at:
• Significant demand reduction of the existing residential building stock through cost-effective low energy retrofitting actions at district scale.
• Increase in RES share of energy supply, through extensive leveraging of local potentials.
• Enhance the use of clean energy in urban mobility, both for citizens and goods, by means of extensive deployment of green vehicles and infrastructure.
An extensive use of ICTs is planned to achieve integration and consistency in demo planning and implementation, and to enable further benefits and secure involvement of citizens.
These actions will be aligned to city-specific Integrated Urban Plans (IUPs), and the process will be replicated in two Follower cities: Lecce, (Italy), and Asenovgrad (Bulgaria) to ensure adaptability and maximize the project impact.

Pseudomonas putida will undergo deep metabolic surgery to channel these diverse substrates efficiently into the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and derivatives. In addition, synthetic downstream processing modules based on the programmed non-lytic secretion of PHA will facilitate the release and recovery of the bioplastic from the bacterial biomass.

These industry driven objectives will help to address the market need for novel routes to valorise the gigantic plastic waste streams in the European Union and beyond, with direct opportunities for SME partners of P4SB spanning the entire value chain from plastic waste via Synthetic Biology to biodegradable plastic. As a result we anticipate a completely biobased process reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste by establishing it as a novel bulk second generation carbon source for industrial biotechnology, while at the same time opening new opportunities for the European plastic recycling industry and helping to achieve the ambitious recycling targets set by the European Union for 2020.",7056968.75,7056968.5,H2020-LEIT-BIO-2014-1,RIA,RHEINISCH-WESTFAELISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE AACHEN,DE,"PROTEUS;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, DUBLIN;BACMINE SL;HELMHOLTZ-ZENTRUM FUR UMWELTFORSCHUNG GMBH - UFZ;BIOPLASTECH LTD;UNIVERSITAET LEIPZIG;AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DEINVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS;SOPREMA;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS;UNIVERSITY OF SURREY",FR;IE;ES;DE;UK,

The general objective of RIBuild is to develop effective, comprehensive decision guidelines to optimise the design and implementation of internal thermal insulation in historic buildings across the EU. RIBuild focuses on heavy external walls made of stone, brick and timber framing, as most historic buildings are made of these materials. The general objective is achieved through three main activities
• To obtain a thorough knowledge level to characterise the eligibility of the building for a deep internal thermal insulation renovation. This knowledge is obtained through screening of historic buildings, investigation of material properties and threshold values for failure
• To determine the conditions under which different internal insulation measures are reliable and affordable measures based on probabilistic modelling of the hygrothermal performance, the environmental impact and the cost/benefit
• To develop a set of comprehensive decision guidelines  and a web-based assessment tool, which are demonstrated in a number of buildings. RIBuild addresses the most difficult retrofitting measure of historic buildings: internal thermal insulation. The adaption of knowledge developed by RIBuild contributes to sustainable historic buildings with improved energy efficiency implying an easier conversion of energy supply from inefficient fossil fuels to efficient renewable energy sources. RIBuild also assesses the hygrothermal performance of the building construction, thus no collateral damage occurs; in case of failure an easy roll back of the measures is possible.

To do this, FLOW will create a link between (currently poorly-connected) walking and cycling and congestion by developing a user-friendly methodology for evaluating the ability of walking and cycling measures to reduce congestion. 
FLOW will develop assessment tools to allow cities to evaluate effects of walking and cycling measures on congestion. Our aim is for the tools to become the standard for assessing the impact of walking and cycling measures on congestion. The tools include a congestion impact assessment (including socio-economic impact, an assessment of soft measures, congestion evaluation based on KPIs and a cost benefit analysis) and traffic modelling. Current modelling software will be calibrated and customised in FLOW partner cities to analyse the relationship of cyclist and pedestrian movements to congestion.
The modelling and impact assessment will identify the congestion reducing effect of walking and cycling measures. FLOW partner cities will develop implementation scenarios and action plans for adding or up-scaling measures that are shown to reduce congestion. FLOW will target three distinct audiences, with appropriate materials and messaging for each. Cities will learn about the value and use of new transport modelling tools, businesses will be made aware of the potential market in congestion busting products and services and decision makers will be provided with facts to argue for walking and cycling to be put on equal footing with other modes of transport.

My group has challenged this view and used a systems biology approach to discover that the lysosome is subject to a global transcriptional regulation, is able to adapt to environmental clues, and acts as a signalling hub to regulate cell homeostasis. Furthermore, an emerging role of the lysosome has been identified in many types of diseases, including the common neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's and Alzheimer’s. These findings have opened entirely new fields of investigation on lysosomal biology, suggesting that there is a lot to be learned on the role of the lysosome in health and disease. The goal of LYSOSOMICS is to use “omics” approaches to study lysosomal function and its regulation in normal and pathological conditions. In this “organellar systems biology project” we plan to perform several types of genetic perturbations in three widely used cell lines and study their effects on lysosomal function using a set of newly developed cellular phenotypic assays. Moreover, we plan to identify lysosomal protein-protein interactions using a novel High Content FRET-based approach. Finally, we will use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate a collection of cellular models for all lysosomal storage diseases, a group of severe inherited diseases often associated with early onset neurodegeneration. State-of-the-art computational approaches will be used to predict gene function and identify disease mechanisms potentially exploitable for therapeutic purposes.

We will optimize known plastics-degrading enzymes for high specific binding capacities, stability, and catalytic efficacy towards a broad spectrum of plastics polymers under high salt and temperature conditions by integrated protein engineering, and also isolate novel enzymes with activities on recalcitrant polymers. MIX-UP will also optimize the production of enzymes and formulate enzyme cocktails tailored to specific waste streams. Implementation of these enzymes, both in vitro and in vivo, enables stable self-sustaining microbiomes to convert the released plastic monomers selectively into at least six value-added products, key building blocks, and biomass. Any remaining material recalcitrant to enzymatic activity will be recirculated into the process after a physico-chemical treatment.

The commercial applications for the ERC “NetSat” project are three-fold: (1) communication (particularly in the machine to machine (M2M) context), (2) traffic management (e.g., for autonomous driving), and (3) earth observation (where larger numbers of small satellites offer higher temporal resolution). As space for the operation of small satellite formations is restricted and primarily US-based, VC-backed start-ups are already competing in the market (e.g., SpaceX, OneWeb), large-scale and timely investments are needed for the ZfT to select and implement the most appropriate business model to successfully compete in this market.

None of the competitors in the small satellite market seem to focus on providing M2M services, and they operate a constellation instead of a formation of satellites, i.e., the satellites are controlled individually from the ground, which makes formations not only technologically superior but also in line with the upcoming trend of connected devices. For timely commercialization, the ERC PoC Grant will provide the needed financial resources for securing IP and an evaluation of 4 potential business models - i.e., (1) a vendor-, (2) a licensing-, (3) a system provider- and (4) a data provider strategy, and the drafting of a business plan within 12 months for the most promising one(s) based on detailed data and analysis from a cross-disciplinary research team seeking to attract large-scale financial investments and corporate partners.'",149823.75,149823.75,ERC-2015-PoC,ERC-POC,Zentrum fuer Telematik e.V.,DE,UNIVERSITAET REGENSBURG;TECHNOLOGIE- UND GRUNDERZENTRUM WUERZBURG (TGZ) GMBH,DE,

Former technologies for domestic heating are either unsuitable for moving forward towards a sustainable energy model across EU, or insufficient in terms of energy efficiency. In order to overcome these issues, BioCurve and Quintin have developed a cutting edge biomass boiler capable of working under condensing conditions. Thanks to a novel spiral heat exchanger that enhances 50% the exchange surface, C-Heat compact solution shows > 100% energy efficiency by capturing almost all latent heat of condensation of water vapor in the exhaust stream. In addition, an accurate control of the system enables low temperature applications (i.e. radiant floors).

In large parts of the global ocean this transport is blocked by a temperature-induced density gradient, with warm light waters residing on top of heavier cold waters. These regions, which are referred to by scientists as ocean deserts, are presently expanding due to surface-ocean warming. Enhancing the upward transport of nutrient-rich deep waters through artificial upwelling can break this blockade and make these waters more productive. Forced upwelling of deep-ocean water has been proposed as a means to serve three distinctly different purposes: (1) to fuel marine primary production for ecosystem-based fish farming; (2) to enhance the ocean’s biological carbon pump to sequester CO2 in the deep ocean; (3) to utilize the surface to deep-ocean temperature gradient to generate renewable energy via Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). Whereas theoretical and technical aspects of applying artificial upwelling for these purposes have been studied to some extent, the ecological responses and biogeochemical consequences are poorly understood. Ocean artUp therefore aims to study the feasibility, effectiveness, associated risks and potential side effects of artificial upwelling in increasing ocean productivity, raising fish production, and enhancing oceanic CO2 sequestration. This will be addressed through a combination of experiments at different scales and trophic complexities, field observations of eddy-induced upwelling in oligotrophic waters, and ecosystem-biogeochemical modelling of pelagic systems fertilized by nutrient-rich deep waters. If technically feasible, ecologically acceptable, and economically viable, the use of artificial upwelling for ecosystem-based fish farming could make an important contribution to an ecologically sustainable marine aquaculture.",2499991.26,2499991.26,ERC-2015-AdG,ERC-ADG,HELMHOLTZ ZENTRUM FUR OZEANFORSCHUNG KIEL,DE,,,

Floating wind turbines (FOWTs) could be a game changer to further decrease the cost of offshore wind energy and unlock new markets. Wind turbines placed on a floating support and moored to the seabed can harness energy in areas with much higher wind speeds, at a reduced installation cost. It also gives the opportunity to countries with deep water to enter the offshore wind industry. The SET-Plan stresses that Europe needs to move fast in deploying FOWTs. It also highlights the urgency to widen the basic knowledge of early-stage researchers (ESRs) towards the design of FOWTs and match it with industrial needs. This European Industrial Doctorate programme will achieve this by delivering 10 doctoral degrees jointly supervised by the public and private sectors. The ESRs will be supervised by 3 universities with a track-record in wind energy research and 5 companies leading the deployment of floating wind farms and heavily involved in policy-making bodies. A mentoring scheme will be tailored to the needs of each ESR, with the involvement of several female senior staff. Scientifically, STEP4WIND will develop floating-specific tools, methods and infrastructures to tackle the technological and economical challenges of FOWTs, from design to deployment, operation and scaling up. The innovations from each ESR will be systematically integrated in a common multi-disciplinary design and optimisation tool to assess their impact on cost, risk and the environment. STEP4WIND will also deliver guidelines for large farm deployments, with a clear roadmap to commercialisation.

Fuel cells need to be fed with a constant supply of oxygen, usually from air provided by a compressor. While much attention has been put on the fuel cell itself and the hydrogen storage, the oxygen supply has not been yet optimized. Currently, air management for fuel cell systems remains a challenge because today’s compressor technologies are not optimized for fuel cell applications.

We are CELEROTON, a Swiss high-tech business at the forefront of high-speed turbo compressor technology. We are able to achieve speeds up to 280,000 rpm, which allows our product to be 20 times lighter and smaller than state-of-the-art compressors, while achieving the highest efficiency of all commercial compressors. Moreover, our compressor is 100% oil-free which results in the highest air purity, crucial to increase the fuel cell lifetime.

Now, with project TURBO-FUELCELL, we aim to take the last technical and commercial steps to introduce our unique turbo compressor as the key technology for oxygen supply in the fuel cell vehicle market. This market with such growth potential (predicted to increase at 22.1% CAGR up to 2024 reaching 1.2 B€), could greatly benefit from the compactness and lightness of our product.

Yet, no cloud provider is currently able to provide all these three benefit together. This pain point arises because the current standard of centralized cloud (i.e., one proprietary web farm serving millions of users) has huge operating costs and recurring weaknesses concerning data security.
Cubbit develops a technology able to disrupt the global cloud industry by replacing the root cause of its problems, i.e., centralized server farms, with a distributed data center based on a peer-to-peer network free from infrastructural costs, highly scalable, and secure by design.
Cubbit turns the storage, CPU, and bandwidth provided by its users - who access the first ever forever-free end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service - into professional web services sold to SMEs customers - who finally get a secure, efficient, and inexpensive cloud.
While around 70% of the revenues made by traditional cloud providers are burnt into direct operating costs, Cubbit is the first provider that turns the costs into a revenue stream as it gains a margin on every domestic server activated.
Cubbit is also environmentally sustainable, using up to 10 times less energy than centralized cloud. For every TB you store on Cubbit, you save the gross equivalent to 100 kgCO2/year.

Apart from being extremely dangerous, this method is time-consuming, costing: the European offshore wind industry suffers from €75 million in production loss due to downtime per year by 2030. 
Leveraging our asset management technology in onshore wind, we have an ambitious plan to expand our offering to the offshore wind industry. A2MIRO helicopter autonomously inspects the offshore turbine and its’ Sensor Head combines visual and infrared cameras to detect defects as small as 0.5mm. Our data analysis software is equipped with machine learning technology to provide our customers deep knowledge about future maintenance needs. A2MIRO’s autonomous inspection capabilities reduce turbine’s downtime, generating cost savings of about €35 million for the offshore wind industry, while enabling the generation of 249,550 MWh additional wind energy. This can power 66,001 households and help avoiding 114,793 tonnes of CO2 emissions. A2MIRO drastically increases HSE in the field as it lowers the need for rotor blade access.

I hypothezise that the fundamental property that sets the halide perovskites apart from conventional SCs and gives rise to their beneficial properties is strongly anharmonic lattice dynamics.
Large amplitude, local polar fluctuations that result from lattice anharmonicity localize the electronic states and enhance the screening of electric charges within the material. 
In other words, in some aspects, halide perovskites behave more like a liquid than a crystalline solid.
    
Stimulated by the recent discoveries on halide perovskites, I aim to generalize our understanding of the relationship between lattice anharmonicity and the electronic properties of SCs. 
The potential outcome of this investigation will be a novel scheme to design SCs with desirable properties where lattice anharmonicity is used as a new material-engineering tool.    

My strategy is to perform comparative studies in both inorganic ionic crystals and small-molecule organic crystals.
We will use low-frequency Raman spectroscopy to quantify anharmonic lattice dynamics and compare between different crystals to identify the factors that induce anharmonicity in solids. 
Photoluminescence, reflectance, time-resolved terahertz and impedance spectroscopies will be used to probe the SCs optical properties, carrier mobilities and lifetimes, and their dielectric response. I expect to find that as anharmonicity increases, the dielectric response and carrier lifetimes increase while carrier mobility decreases.   
Finally, we will develop a modulated Raman spectroscopic methodology that will identify specific lattice motions that are coupled to band-edge carriers, thus elucidating the microscopic mechanism of carrier-lattice interactions.",1700000.0,1700000.0,ERC-2019-STG,ERC-STG,WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE,IL,,,

These are the challenges in micro energy harvesting from (local) ambient sources. 
Kinetic, thermal and solar energies are ubiquitous at our surroundings under diverse forms, but their relatively low intensity and intermittent availability limit their potential recovery by microscale devices. These restrictions call for multi-source energy harvesters working under two principles: 1) combining different single-source harvesters in one device, or 2) using multifunctional materials capable of simultaneously converting various energy sources into electricity.

This is power consuming, brings in particles from the seawater which is causing frequent clogging of filters and gives high maintenance cost for the operator. Chlorination of the seawater is environmentally challenging.

Future Technology(FT), the Norwegian SME company behind the COOLWIND project solves this by introducing the unique patented subsea cooler FSCC® (Future Subsea Controllable Cooler).

In Europe alone it is estimated to yearly 3,734 TWh, similar to that of conventional wind turbines AWEs extract energy from winds at altitudes of 500 - 1,500 m where the winds are much faster and more stable than close to the surface where conventional wind turbines operate. This gives a predictable and stable energy source without the same need for balancing and storing in the energy system as conventional wind does. The kite is almost invisible up in the sky and requires a minimal terrestrial footprint. The kite from Kitemill offers electricity at c€ 4.1/kWh already, expected to drop to c€ 2.8/kWh by 2030, outperforming by a distance conventional wind turbines at c€ 4.1/kWh today, but without the same potential for cost reductions as Kitemill. It is able to take-off and land vertically, while competitors need to launch and land like normal sailplanes. Kitemill plans to commercialize its technology through a minimum viable product (MPV) approach and stepwise upscaling of the kite turbines (30 kW/150 kW/500 kW). Kitemill has secured a customer for the world's first demonstration park of five 30 kW units that will be built during this project at Lista (Norway). The overall success criterion for this project is to establish demonstration parks and accumulate operation hours on the kite system, as this is a key enabler for commercial introduction. The market opportunities are abundant; as an example, our kites can replace thousands of decommissioned conventional wind turbines offshore where the foundations are no longer certified to carry heavy loads. If successful, the business is easily scalable and the turnover may reach €97m by 2024, while at the same time mitigate greenhouse gas emissions at low investments.",3488737.5,2442116.25,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-2,SME-2,KITEMILL AS,NO,,,

The project focused on the development of core materials (membrane-electrode assemblies, MEAs) of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and water electrolysers (PEMWEs). Water electrolysis is one promising opportunity to address the challenge of renewable energy storage, since the hydrogen produced offers large storage capacities and can be efficiently reconverted to electricity via fuel cells. Despite its advantages, PEMWE is currently not yet widespread because of the high cost and the low durability of the cell components over time. The membrane is known to be the weakest component for long term performance, with low mechanical strength, high permeation and high creep. Reduction in the thickness of the membrane, while keeping low gas permeability and high mechanical resistance, would represent a real breakthrough, allowing for lower operating cell voltage. The HYDROGEN project (HighlY performing proton exchange membrane water electrolysers with reinforceD membRanes fOr efficient hydrogen GENeration) will tackle these issues with the preparation of novel MEAs based on membranes reinforced with extensive networks of active polymer fibres prepared by electrospinning. This concept was developed under SPINAM, where the results of the work were brought to TRL 3/4, with four-fold improvement in chemical and mechanical stability during electrochemical accelerated aging tests over state-of-the art reinforced membranes.

Cost-effectiveness is one of the main roadblocks limiting ubiquitous sensor deployment, particularly indoors; a roadblock that the IoT sensor industry has a strong need to remove. Indoor sensors need batteries, which must be replaced. Energy harvesting can extend battery lifetimes, but current energy harvesting solutions do not produce enough power: thermal/motion solutions are not applicable for most IoT sensors, and photovoltaics are inefficient at low light conditions. 
Swedish green startup Epishine have produced the world’s first metal-free organic reel-to-reel printable PV module for indoor light energy harvesting in ultra-low illumination.
Our ultra-light, ultra-thin, flexible material has a wide range of applications. Its world-leading efficiency at low illumination levels verified by a third party as (>65% better than closest competition at 50 lux), and its low production costs, enable a best-in-class market entry price (€1 for a 20 cm2 module) and performance. This makes our Light Energy Harvesting (LEH) Modules uniquely suited for powering the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. This fills a critical gap in the market, enabling a step-change in operating costs and deployment scales for IoT sensors.

Batteries are the most common solution but other less known technologies like fuel cells and supercapacitors are also used where their characteristics are more suited for the given application. E.g. supercapacitors for high power energy storage to utilize regenerative braking more efficiently. The prevalence of such technologies is to a large extent limited by their cost-effectiveness. Today’s supercapacitors are based on an electrolyte system which was established in the 80s. This pure organic electrolyte system has a significantly higher potential stability window compared to classical aqueous electrolytes, but at the same time a much higher cost and a high impact on the environment if accidently released. A recent discovery of the exact nature which limits the potential stability of aqueous supercapacitor electrolytes has formed the foundation of an invention of a new hybrid electrolyte system which combines the advantages of both organic and aqueous electrolytes. This invention has formed the basis for the formation of the company Innocell ApS which purpose is to bring the first generation of hybrid electrolyte supercapacitors to the market. Currently the cell voltage achieved with the first-generation electrolyte is 2.3 V which results in comparable performance with today’s supercapacitors because of the increased capacitance and conductivity that is a characteristic of the hybrid electrolyte. However, it is expected that a further development of electrolyte system could result in a voltage of 2.8 V which combined with the higher capacitance, conductivity and lower cost of the hybrid electrolyte would revolutionize the supercapacitor industry.

This involves heavy
processes and chemicals with harsh labour conditions, substantial transport and pollution emissions. Waste from extractive
processes is one of the largest waste streams in the EU (727 million tonnes p.a.), with certain fractions containing high
concentrations of toxic substances including heavy metals. The mining and processing of virgin materials is a leading cause
of deforestation and requires huge amounts of energy and water. Furthermore, these processes account for 7% of global
energy consumption and contribute substantially to carbon emissions. The widespread use of secondary (recycled) raw
materials is crucial to addressing this global challenge.
The European metal recycling industry has the potential to be a major contributor to a sustainable future for the EU.
However, it is outdated, offline, and inefficient, leading to low recycling rates even for valuable commodities. The Schrott24
Platform is an intelligent online marketplace that digitises and automates large parts of the industry for scrap metal and
recycled metals. It dynamically matches buyers and sellers to optimise outcomes for both parties, aligning the European
scrap trading market with the digital single market.
We use advanced pricing and matching algorithms, matching the seller of a certain metal scrap, with a certain logistics need,
with the most efficient recycling solution. This can be a local scrap yard for a small electrician with 500kg of copper cable
waste, or a specialized aluminium smelter that is in need of a specific alloy in the yard of a scrap dealer unknown to them.
With the integration of transport service providers, they are not only matched, but we can facilitate the whole process, to
ensure the fulfilment of the clients’ needs. Schrott24 is disrupting the industry, allowing it to deliver a sustainable, circular

Especially in metal making processes, metallic scraps from end of life goods are recycled and used as secondary raw materials in the processes. Usage of scrap is both ecologically and commercially beneficial, since it reduces the depletion of natural resources like virgin ores and avoids landfills with waste material. Today even more important is that the energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of the reduction processes of metal ores can be reduced or even totally avoided when using recycled materials as feedstock. However, the metal production facilities are facing an increasing variability in material and energy feedstock.   

To cope with this challenge, existing metal production plants need to be retrofitted with appropriate sensors for scrap analysis and furnace operation, to cope with the varying conditions of the feedstock regarding materials and energy. Furthermore, the selection of the optimal feedstock in terms of material and energy efficiency has to be improved by application of appropriate process control and decision support tools. Also solid scrap preheating systems can increase the energy efficiency of the melting processes. To monitor and control the process behaviour in an optimal way, model-based software tools have to be developed and applied.

The main objective of the REVaMP project is to develop, adapt and apply novel retrofitting technologies to cope with the increasing variability and to ensure an efficient use of the feedstock in terms of materials and energy. This will be exemplarily demonstrated within three different use cases from the metal making industry. Due to the industrial relevance, the use cases were chosen from electric and oxygen steelmaking, aluminium refining and lead recycling.

Wastewater treatment sludge and manure treatment technologies are currently not satisfactory and there is no solution to efficiently re-use the resources it contains: phosphorous and carbon.
The aim of REBOOT is to completely recover phosphorous from wastes while generating carbon neutral transportation fuels and a carbon sink in the form of carbon materials. The project will employ a frontier technology called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) which uses high temperature and pressure to produce a liquid product similar to petroleum termed bio-crude. This will be used for a range of innovative applications such as renewable aviation fuel, functionalized carbon materials and bio-bitumen.
The possibility of complete phosphorous recovery in HTL is a completely new concept, previously thought impossible as only continuous HTL reactors can theoretically achieve this. The complex hydrothermal chemistry of salts can only be exploited on such advanced reactors that are currently beyond state-of-the-art. The specific objectives of REBOOT are: (1) mechanistic understanding of salt behaviour in multi-phase hydrothermal systems with the aim of full recovery. (2) Develop tailored strategies for in-situ jet fuel synthesis. (3) Establish microbial electrolysis cells for in-situ hydrogen production and nutrient recovery.
REBOOT will be carried out on pilot continuous reactors, where the challenging physical conditions can be explored, exploited and new engineering solutions developed.

However, these materials still rely on the use of toxic Pb and lack of long-term stability. Moreover, distracted by a race for higher conversion efficiencies, the development of in-vacuum deposition techniques to reproducibly and controllably grow these hybrid films has been highly overlooked. This is now the main hurdle for the full exploration of Pb-free and stable hybrid halides, which might not be as defect tolerant or easily produced by solution process as PbHP. Therefore, a revolutionary method allowing the discovery of new sustainable complex hybrid materials is now, more than ever, of paramount importance. Here I describe a completely new approach that allows stoichiometric and layer-by-layer in-vacuum deposition of wide families of organic-inorganic materials, and their mixture in any pre-determined ratio. To overcome the specific challenges of hybrid film growth (incompatible volatility and solubility) I propose Pulsed Dual-Laser Deposition (PDLD) to decouple the deposition of the inorganic and organic sources with two distinct laser sources, a high energy (UV) and a low energy (IR), all in one vacuum system. Only this decoupling will allow the control and versatility to bridge the hybrid materials discovery gap and to tackle open scientific questions regarding the interplay between the organic and inorganic components, defect nature and their influence on optical properties, carrier scattering and recombination phenomena. Combining these fundamental insights with controlled growth, will enable the design of a new generation of stable and non-toxic hybrid films.

In this context, DSOs and TSOs are facing more complex grid operations, including challenges like reverse power flows, additional power flows in transmission systems and grid stability issues. Available tools for grid management in this changing environment have often underperformed for several reasons (e.g. unavailability of grid models, data management restrictions, use of conventional approaches to the application algorithms, etc.).   INTERPRETER will overcome limitations of existing tools through a modular grid management solution consisting of a set of 10 software applications for an optimal design, planning, operation and maintenance of the electricity grid – with a special focus on the distribution network – that will be offered to grid operators through an open-source interoperable platform. These tools will support DSOs and TSOs to move from a traditional grid management approach to an active system management approach, considering the rapid deployment of distributed energy resources as well as growing environmental concerns.

It addresses key digestate issues including environmental and health risks, handling, variable composition and the increasing volume being produced. Currently, turning digestate into bio-fertiliser products is not feasible for most small plants due to lack of available, cost-effective equipment, and the expense of achieving end of waste standard PAS110. 

Building on partners’ previous work, the proposed technology will utilise heat from combustion of waste timber and recovered energy from a collection vehicle to improve energy efficiency while simultaneously addressing regulatory compliance. Specific nutrients will be extracted from the liquid fraction and water recovered for reuse. The remaining sludge will be blended & composted with ash (derived from waste timber combustion) and biochar to produce optimised, nutrient-balanced soil conditioners. The model rests on the solution’s mobility and modularity as one unit could serve multiple plants, tackling digestate from a range of feedstocks with shared costs making it more viable than installing systems at individual plants.

Other project activities include stakeholder engagement; field trials across contrasting regions; policy recommendations; a comprehensive impact assessment of the business model; and dissemination of key outputs.

Climate changes and limited resources for farming lead to increased interest in new sources of nutrients alternative to meat. Additionally, human diet undergoes a significant shift towards proteins. Therefore, the growth of plant protein market is predicted to be drastically driven up in the coming years. Oilseeds, known for their high content of nutritious proteins, are expected to take center stage as main source of plant proteins aimed for human consumption. Nowadays, the main product of rapeseed processing is oil. A by-product – rapeseed cake – is used as animal feed. There is no commercial technology capable of extracting fully functional protein from rapeseed cake. At NapiFeryn BioTech (NFB) we came up with a new technology which allows more efficient use of this by-product. Our technology is protected with three patent applications. It enables full recovery of high-quality rapeseed cake proteins, ready to be used in food industry. Our business model is based on licensing of the technology to rapeseed processors. Licensing fee will be calculated individually for each oilseed processor or integrated formulator, based on the annual scale of the processed rapeseed. We have validated the pricing strategy with rapeseed processors. The first license agreement has been signed already in 2016.

Aquatic biomass can provide renewable energy (e.g. biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas) as well as high-value molecules such as carotenoids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and food fibres, which can be used in food, feed, cosmetics, biomaterials, nanostructures and pharmaceutical industries. However, in order to greatly increase the economic viability of aquatic biomass, all components found in the biomass need to be valorized. Unfortunately, valorization of multiple biomass components is not possible using current/conventional biorefinery technologies, where up to 90% of the biomass is being treated as a waste. The value of these broken-down compounds sees more than a ten-fold reduction, rendering the biorefinery economically unfeasible. Therefore, in furtherance of developing multiproduct biorefineries, selective and economically feasible extraction and separation technologies will need to be developed and implemented. Significant microalgal cell disruption and extraction advances have been recently made by employing external fields such as lasers, ultrasonic waves and microwaves, in combination with less aggressive solvents and ionic liquids. However, the issues regarding the use of chemicals and multiple separation stages remain. Thus, we are proposing a game-changing single-step disentanglement and separation of microalgal high-value components by using acoustic waves at different frequencies allowing thus a complete process fine-tuning and eliminating the need for chemicals.

Therefore, the aim of the MoVEMENT project is to combine fundamental constraints on the physical properties (density and viscosity) of volatile-bearing melts with complex modelling to gain a quantitative understanding of the deep volatile cycles and related geophysical processes inside the planet. The applicant will achieve these scientific breakthroughs by combining two novel approaches: first, he will capitalize on new experimental methods at synchrotron sources to acquire missing data on the density and viscosity of carbon-bearing melts at high pressure; second, he will integrate the novel data into rigorous and continuous computer models for the density and viscosity of volatile-bearing melts. The new models will allow predictions of the mobility of volatile-bearing melts in a range of pressure, temperature (20 GPa – 2500 °C ) and compositions, i.e. from carbonatites (CO2-rich melts) to basalts (SiO2-rich melts), that span the conditions for melts stabilized in the upper mantle.

The SRF is a fuel produced by shredding and dehydrating solid waste, typically consisting of combustible components. While promising as thermally recoverable waste, the SRF potential is today underexploited due to technical, economic and regulatory issues. Our company LCEET has thus designed an innovative micro-gasification technology – called REAL – to overcome current challenges of SRF valorisation, reducing the flue gas volume (-40%), the installation size and related capital investment (by up to 45%). Face to other technologies, REAL allows for an energy recovery over 80%. This project also addresses the challenges of the EU energy markets which face a continuous increase of electricity consumption that overloads the power stations and threatens the supply security and power quality. Decentralised energy production is a solution that can complement current central generation supply infrastructures. Despite the advantages, current developers are hindered by: non-shared governance, limited technical solutions, complexity of finances, management of investments, profitability, efficiency and sustainability. REAL aims to implement a business model to boost territorial energy autonomy, by supporting municipalities, industries, citizens in the decision, development and management of small local production units, competitive in the liberalised energy market without any additional subsidy. This project guarantees energy supply & quality at competitive price and a reduction of associated cost to waste management.

The development and
promotion of abundant and clean alternatives such as liquid hydrogen, liquid biomethane, nitrogen (all renewable fuels) and
LNG is becoming a necessity. These gaseous fuels are among the serious options to be considered. Hydrogen, for example,
can be produced anywhere where there is water and a source of electricity. And hydrogen-fueled vehicles emit no
greenhouse gases or other pollutants. During combustion, hydrogen produces only water vapour.
However, these fuels have significant infrastructure and transport limitations. Hydrogen is currently expensive also because
is difficult to handle and store. The same applies to fuels like LNG.
The current method of transporting LNG and other gas-based fuels like hydrogen, biomethane and nitrogen, is the cryogenic
tanker. Specialised driver/operator training, and expensive equipment is required to handle these tanker—trailers and as
such, there is often limited infrastructure for them outside states with large petrochemical industries. This limited transport
infrastructure has, in turn, led to limited support infrastructure.
GGLS has developed the GBG™, lightweight composite tanks for collecting, transporting and storing cryogenic materials,
specifically gaseous fuels. These patented tanks can be used as an integral part of a system to maintain a continuous
cryogenic gas supply or as on board fuel tanks for use in road vehicles, particularly heavy trucks, coaches, buses and vans
or for rail, marine and aircraft applications.
GBG™ innovative tanks are capable of revolutionising the collection, distribution and storage at the point of use of
renewable fuels in both cryogenic and gaseous forms. Indeed, rather than transferring fuel, the GBG™ system is based on
exchanging tanks, which are more safely and securely refilled under controlled conditions.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,GLOBAL GAS LOGISTIC SOLUTIONS LTD,UK,,,

However, current electrocatalysts are very inefficient in producing these multi-carbon compounds. This action proposes the investigation of an exciting and highly innovative strategy in eCO2RR catalysis—based on functionalizing the catalyst surface with tailored thiol ligands—with a clear potential to overcome the mechanistic hurdles toward C2 product formation. To this end, STRATCAT-CO2 will adopt an interdisciplinary approach combining model catalysts, state-of-the-art characterization, and a close synergy between experimental and theoretical research to gain a mechanistic understanding of surface functionalization that can guide catalyst development. In addition, this action will build bridges between fundamental efforts and electrode and device engineering to achieve breakthrough performance under conditions relevant for practical implementation. STRATCAT-CO2 will provide fresh perspectives in catalyst design for the eCO2RR and, by reaching the foreseen performance targets, set the basis for the development of new electrochemical processes for ethanol and ethylene production.

The waste management sector currently ranks as the 3rd most accident-prone industry, with fire being involved in nearly 80% of all accident occurrences. Fire represents one the biggest threats due to its devastating consequences: up to 70% of the companies suffering from a big fire report insolvency in the next year. Current fire protection systems do not accomplish the specific requirements of this type of industries yet. They have either a too long detection time (as those based on smoke detection) or a very high rate of false alarms (thermal detection).

Our system captures thermal images with an IR camera that are processed by our outstanding SW that can unambiguously distinguish any hotspot from a real fire, reducing the number of false alarms to zero. In addition, we have incorporated an automatic fire extinction system linked to a 3D image able to direct the suppression agent only to the affected area.

This figure is representative of way more complex scenario in which thousands of tons of electronic products are daily placed in the market, substituting the old ones. As a consequence, the amount of electronic waste is dramatically increasing. The industrial plants that can treat this kind of waste are limited. As a result, what can’t be treated in Europe is sent outside the borders to be treated in developing countries where the cost of the labor is reduced and environmental legislation is often poor. While we give away all the content of this waste, we import raw materials in order to produce new electronics. Nothing farer from the circular economy approach envisaged by the European commission. 
The specific target of the present PCBIS project is the waste printed circuit board (WPCB), that in most of the cases is treated with a pyrometallurgical approach, making use of high temperature in order to obtain the separation of metals and the volatilization of plastics; it is really effective in this task, but it has two major limitations: i. Very high opex; ii. Increasing environmental limits force to continuous update of the plants. Our project aims to recover metals from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) with innovative electrochemical technologies that do not require large scale in order to be economically sustainable. This allows for the development of a diffuse network of industrial sites all across the Europe, reducing the environmental cost of WPCBs delivery. 
In our process the most important reagent will be the electron, which is a clean reagent that can be also produced on site by coupling the electrochemical cells with renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic PVs.

One of the most recurrent question raised by professionals is: 'how much water is there and when will it become available'? 
We have developed a new technology, called Waterjade, capable of predicting water resources at high resolution, both in terms of snow and river discharge. Differently from other competitive technologies, it adopts a physically based modeling approach that integrates multiple sources of data, like in-situ stations, numerical weather predictions and satellite data. The advantages are increased accuracy and scalability to ungauged basins. 
Our customers are hydropower companies, whom we deliver a service of snow monitoring upstream the production plants, so they can quantify the energy that is likely to be produced in the long run, and a service of short-term inflow predictions to the plants, useful for safety reason and to optimize the energy production. We are extending the service of snow monitoring also to the public sector, that use it for safety reasons (avalanches) and as an index to anticipate drought.
Working with public and private sectors is giving positive feedback, both in terms of credibility and accuracy as we can benefit from the capillary distribution of in-situ stations from public agencies.
The business model is a 'subscription-based Service' to the Waterjade portal and the market potential is estimated in about 500 M€/y worldwide, with great potential in particular for hydropower, Europe's and world’s largest renewable energy resource.

In ordar to tackle this challenge we are proposing a novel way to improve the UV stability of thermally modified wood using nano based stabilizers. But instead of coating nanoparticles on heat treated wood, wood surfaces will be treated with nanoparticle (ZnO or CeO2) solutions, thereby forming protective envelope on a wooden surface, which will be further heat treated under controlled  temperature and time.

As the share exceeds 25%, it causes high levels of grid instability that can lead to supply insecurity and outages. As a result, EU electricity distribution operators will require €480 billion by 2035 to expand their networks to overcome challenges associated with integrating renewables if cost and service life of current energy storage technologies are not improved. The only two energy storage methods that have acceptable cost and life: pumped hydro-storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES) do not have the required rapid response times and are severely limited by geographic restrictions. While battery energy storage (BES) systems have the required instantaneous response, current technologies are prohibitively expensive and have limited lifespans and have safety risks.

In response to this, Greenvolt Nanoma ehf, an Icelandic company uses nanotechnology to develop the first ever BES technology to meet all performance and cost criteria for grid applications. Our Nano-Edison battery’s costs and service life are comparable to PHS and CAES. Our solution is also tolerant to heavy currents, overcharging/discharging and even short circuits and can support pulse charging – making it ideal for capturing variable renewable energies.

As such, we have a unique advantage within the rapidly growing €7.34 billion global market for grid-scale battery storage. With a viable technology that enables grid operators to defer investments in costly network expansion, we seek to be the global leader in energy storage for stationary applications.

Furthermore, the heat excess on PV modules reduces their energy conversion efficiency and the high PV module temperatures under in real-life environment reduce the lifecycle of PV modules and increases maintenance cost. LightCatcher is a disruptive solution that simultaneously addresses PV energy efficiency and the problems created by waste heat in the solar PV industry: i) recycling of waste heat into electricity and ii) passive cooling of the PV device. The combination of both effects leads to solar-to-electricity efficiencies of up to 80%. By maximising electricity production and equipment lifecycle, while reducing CAPEX, maintenance cost, and ROI time LightCatcher will reduce PV levelized cost of energy in over 33%, helping the PV industry to become cost competitive against traditional energy sources.

While the last decade has seen disruptive improvements in battery technology, even with current leading-edge solutions, large-scale applications of batteries are not economically feasible in many scenarios. 
This incapacity to consume large amounts of excess electricity has been one of the biggest obstacles to high penetration of renewable energy systems, such as wind power. 
Our CEO, José Campos Rodrigues, Electrical and Nuclear Engineer, has invented, patented and demonstrated a new technology for efficient electrochemical production of synthetic natural gas (SNG). This is considered a great energy storage due to rising prices for natural gas and the dependency from imports, and as energy carrier offers the advantages to be easily stored, transported and back-converted into energy.
The European Patented Electrogas is a system that can be scaled from 1kW up to 1MW of power and will generate SNG using available non-dispatchable electricity.
Conventional techniques to produce SNG require high temperatures and pressures. The capacity of Electrogas to produce synthetic gas at low temperature and pressure is revolutionary for its technical and economic feasibility.
Our consolidated market segments will exceed 5 billion € in 2020 (2 digits annual growth rate), including Synthetic Fuels, the Electricity storage market, grid management systems, Islands and other isolated systems and micro-grids.

In particular, micro cogeneration in the residential sector allows householders to produce their own electricity (that they can also export to the grid) and use by-product heat for heating and/or cooling, significantly reducing greenhouse emissions and saving primary energy. Their huge potential has been recognized by the EU, especially considering that households’ consumption accounts for 25.4% of total European energy consumption. 
We at MITIS, small Belgian technological enterprise, are committed to the development of efficient and clean micro CHP systems based on gas microturbines. We present FLAMINCO, a ground-breaking micro CHP boiler system designed to replace conventional domestic boilers in households, and that can be integrated in individual/community smart grids with other renewables.

The glass tiles specially developed for this purpose combine photovoltaic elements, connections and stable, durable glass surface. The solar modules applied are extra-ordinary robust and durable and can be quickly and easily installed and connected with a 'plug-in system'. The road is converting sunlight into electricity, using already existing roads as energy source. SOLMOVE is the most experienced manufacturer for solar panels for road surfaces worldwide, with several test cases already established. The glass surface morphology guides light in a verifiably optimized way to the underlying solar cells in comparison to plane surfaces. The modules are non-slip, resilient through vehicles, have a self-cleaning and nitrogen oxides absorbing coating and a better noise absorption vs. asphalt.
Target customers are owners of land, road and parking spaces as well as municipalities. Solar roads can refinance road construction and create new markets for municipalities, energy providers, private investors and cooperatives in public-private partnership models. SOLMOVE is currently working with 6 partners on 3 continents to put into practice concepts for first pilot plants in Asia, Europe, USA and the Middle East.

COZMOS will develop an energy-efficient and environmentally and economically viable conversion of CO2 to fuels and high added value chemicals via an innovative, cost effective catalyst, reactor and process. The concept will combine the sequential reactions of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and methanol to C3 hydrocarbons, exploiting Le Chatelier's principle to overcome low equilibrium product yields of methanol. Complete conversion of CO2 to a 85 % yield of C3 hydrocarbons will be achieved by using an optimised bifunctional catalyst within a single reactor. The optimised catalyst will allow the combined reactions, that currently run at disparate temperatures and pressures, to operate in a temperature/pressure 'sweet spot', which will reduce infrastructure and provide energy and production cost savings. The concept will allow tunable production of propane, an easily stored fuel used for heating, cooking and transportation, and the more valuable product propene, a base chemical primarily polymerised to lightweight plastics, depending on location, amount of available renewable energy and economic needs. The integrated technology will be demonstrated at TRL5 on off-gases from the energy intensive steel and refinery industries. Markets for both propane and propene are expected to grow in the coming years, such that the COZMOS technology will contribute to achieving a Circular Economy and diversified economic base in carbon-intensive regions.

EcoFLEXY ready-to-use packaging films can be produced at a comparable cost to fossil plastics, due to an innovative “white biotechnology” production process: aerobic fermentation produces a unique, 100% pure, nanomaterial combining the positive attributes of cellulose with qualities such as extraordinary mechanical strength. 
Most food packaging solutions made from fossil-based plastics are produced and consumed in an unsustainable manner.  They emit greenhouse gases during production and degradation; the majority of food packaging is intended for single-use, while it takes hundreds of years for the material to degrade; large volumes of food plastic packaging ends up as litter, resulting in high waste management costs and the pollution of our ecosystem; and plastics are entering the food chain with potential harmful effects on human health. 
There is an urgent need for bio-based alternatives. Given the emphasis that policy makers and consumers are placing on environmental issues, bio- based food packaging is likely to grow by 28.3% between 2018 and 2024.
Related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 12, Cellugy is taking action and facilitating the transition towards more sustainable food packaging solutions.
EcoFLEXY is: produced from food waste (second-generation feedstocks); simple and cheap to produce through a near carbon-neutral production process; avoids microplastics pollution in the ocean; is home compostable and is recyclable in the existing system. 
By 2026, Cellugy aims to be a leading player in the €0.9bn global market for flexible packaging for the food industry with a market share of 2.4%. 
This feasibility study will permit Cellugy to confirm customer requirements for sustainable packaging, explore different food applications and specify target markets, validate the production process and identify the resources required to support growth.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,CELLUGY,DK,,,

TRI-HP systems will include advanced controls, managing electricity, heat and cold in a way that optimizes the performance of the system and increases its reliability via failure self-detection. The flexibility will be achieved by allowing for three heat sources: solar (with ice/water as storage medium), ground and ambient air. The innovations proposed will reduce the system cost by at least 10-15% compared to current heat pump technologies with equivalent energetic performances. Two natural refrigerants with very low global warming potential, propane and carbon dioxide, will be used as working fluids for adapted system architectures that specifically target the different heating and cooling demands across Europe. The newly-developed systems will find application in both new and refurbished multi-family buildings, allowing to cover the major part of Europe’s building stock.

However, currently the installation of SOFC is difficult to design and run in an economically convenient way, due to the difficulty in predicting and optimizing the capacity utilization factor, i.e. the number of hours the m-CHP is operating, which depends on the fluctuating and seasonal heating demand of the application.
SOLUTION: EGG1 is a patented configuration which combines SOFC with electric driven Heat Pump (HP) and an innovative control system able to optimize and make profitable the application of SOFC for residential and small commercial applications, by decoupling the heat and electricity production from the user demands, so making it able to respond to the electricity price signals or demand/response in smart grid configurations. EGG1 supplies power and heating demands using natural gas without any combustion, thus without any harmful smog and PM emission into the atmosphere, maximizing the capacity utilization factor and making SOFC and HP become economically profitable even in very cold climates, thanks to reduction of the energy bill of >50%.

Reliable and sustainable energy sources that can be utilized in large parts of Europe and that are able to balance these fluctuations are needed. Geothermal energy has the potential to become an excellent source for both base and flexible energy demands, providing much lower environmental footprint than both fossil and biomass fuels, as well as much less risks and societal resistance than nuclear power. 

There are however some techno-economic challenges which needs to be addressed to facilitate highly flexible operation of geothermal power plants. In GeoSmart, we propose to combine thermal energy storages with flexible ORC solutions to provide a highly flexible operational capability of a geothermal installation. During periods with low demand, energy will be stored in the storage to be released at a later stage when the demand is higher. As this approach does not influence the flow condition at the wellhead, critical infrastructures will be unaffected under variable energy generation. To improve efficiency, we also propose a hybrid cooling system for the ORC plant to prevent efficiency degradation due to seasonal variations. Efficiency will be further improved by larger power plant heat extraction enabled due to a scaling reduction system consisting of specially design retention tank, heat exchanger, and recombining with extracted gases. The scaling reduction system has the potential to almost double power production of many medium enthalpy geothermal plants. Overall, GeoSmart technologies will drastically reduce geothermal energy costs, making it cost competitive with its fossil fuel-based counterparts.

Utonomy, a British/German SME, is developing a novel, cost-effective smart grid technology that monitors and controls gas pressure, flow & gas quality by means of cloud-based, algorithm-driven hardware that can be easily installed without the need for any changes in the gas infrastructure. Utonomy has already developed a pressure management application that helps utilities reduce gas leakage to TRL 6, with the first field pilots planned for January 2018. However, during development work and in the course of discussions with future customers, Utonomy discovered that pressure management has even more commercial potential when applied to increase the grid feed-in capacity of biomethane plants. The system provides valuable data from day 1, it has an exceptionally short payback period and the increased output enabled by the innovation could result in total CO2 mitigation of approx. 26m tonnes p.a. in the UK, France, the Netherlands and Germany.

Since 1950s more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastics have been produced worldwide (348 million in 2017 ). From this, almost 80% have been landfilled or leaked into the ocean increasing more and more the negative environmental impact (leachate and greenhouse gases). Currently, more than a quarter of the plastic production is packaging, growing 5% per year, which only 14% is recycled while the rest is incinerated (14%), leakage into the environment (32%) and landfilled (40%).
Plastdeink has born to solve the main recycling problems that affects the EU since the last decades:
- Multilayer plastic is not recyclable
- Inked recycled plastic packaging goes to downcycling
- Post-industrial plastic never end in the market
THE SOLUTION
Plastdeink is a unique technology able to delaminate and deink laminated and surface-printed film. CADEL DEINKING (a technology-based SME founded in 2014) has developed an innovative, environmentally friendly and low-cost process to delaminate & deink printed plastic scraps.
Plastic (delaminated and deinked) obtained with this process has a similar quality to virgin plastic, what converts it in a high value product for several applications. The product obtained with Plastdeink is a 45% cheaper than virgin plastic. 
CADEL´s proposal has the objective to contribute to a real Circular Economy in the frame of EU plastic waste policy for mono and multi-material flexible packaging.
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
CADEL´s delaminated & deinked technology is an important breakthrough for the plastic industry. Plastdeink represents a business opportunity to our potential customers: the process removes inked, odours and delaminate in one step to reintroduce the plastic into high-added value applications.
 - Plastic converters will be able to use their own plastic scraps, instead of buying new virgin plastic (so much expensive)
 - Plastic recyclers will be able to produce high value-added plastic at a low production cost.",1594635.0,1116244.5,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-2,SME-2,CADEL DEINKING S.L.,ES,,,

This concept will be demonstrated at Dunkirk between DK6 combined cycle power plant, Arcelor Mittal steel factory and one of the major European harbor, a solid showcase for future replication.
The CO2 present in the blast furnace gas will be selectively removed and combined with green hydrogen generated by electrolysis fed with renewable electricity to produce two promising energy carriers. It will allow to simultaneously reuse CO2 emission from the steel-making factory, electricity surplus in the Dunkirk area and to improve the operational and environmental performance of the DK6 combined cycle. C2FUEL unique circular approach could contribute to mitigate up to 2,4 Mt CO2 per year.
Key technical and economic challenges to be tackled in the project are high temperature electrolysis, innovative production routes of DME and FA from renewable H2 and captured CO2. The developed processes will be integrated, demonstrated and validated in an industrial relevant environment and the produced fuel will be tested in real end-user systems. Technical-economic-environmental feasibility and societal acceptance will be carried out to ensure the replication potential.
C2FUEL key projected targets are an annual production of 2,4 Mt of formic acid, 100 kt of green hydrogen for seasonal storage using 3,6TWh of renewable electricity and 1,2 Mt of DME with 320 kt of green hydrogen using 11TWh of renewable electricity.

Current multistage CCU technologies using renewable electricity to yield fuels suffer from low energy efficiency and require large CAPEX.   eCOCO2 combines smart molecular catalysis and process intensification to bring out a novel efficient, flexible and scalable CCU technology. The project aims to set up a CO2 conversion process using renewable electricity and water steam to directly produce synthetic jet fuels with balanced hydrocarbon distribution (paraffin, olefins and aromatics) to meet the stringent specifications in aviation.   The CO2 converter consists of a tailor-made multifunctional catalyst integrated in a co-ionic electrochemical cell that enables to in-situ realise electrolysis and water removal from hydrocarbon synthesis reaction. This intensified process can lead to breakthrough product yield and efficiency for chemical energy storage from electricity, specifically CO2 per-pass conversion > 85%, energy efficiency > 85% and net specific demand < 6 MWh/t CO2. In addition, the process is compact, modular –quickly scalable- and flexible, thus, process operation and economics can be adjusted to renewable energy fluctuations. As a result, this technology will enable to store more energy per processed CO2 molecule and therefore to reduce GHG emissions per jet fuel tone produced from electricity at a substantial higher level. eCOCO2 aims to demonstrate the technology (TRL-5) by producing > 250 g of jet fuel per day in an existing modular prototype rig that integrates 18 tubular intensified electrochemical reactors.

The first catalytic reaction at the channel entrance selectively generates a product, which is further converted in a follow-up reaction catalysed at the core material at the bottom of the channel. The endeavour to locally assemble catalysts with different properties in nano-confined reaction volumes to actualise cascade reaction pathways will be extended to layered nanoparticle structures. Together with an anisotropic provision of a gaseous reactant through a hydrophobic/hydrophilic phase boundary of specifically designed gas diffusion electrodes multi-step catalytic cascade reactions become feasible. The development and extensive evaluation of multi-catalyst gas-diffusion electrodes using operando electrochemistry/spectroscopy and nano-electrochemical tools as well as multi flow-through electrolysers will provide the fundamental knowledge concerning the relative location of different catalyst particles, which synergistically perform chemical cascade reaction with high selectivity and at high current densities. These gas-diffusion electrodes will be integrated in novel electrolyser concepts targeting CO2 recycling at high current density in alkaline solution under suppression of H2 competition with previously unprecedented selectivity for the formation of higher hydrocarbons envisioning contributions to a closed carbon cycle economy and a substantial decrease of CO2 emission.

Shifting towards a low-carbon economy requires cost-effective carbon capture solutions to be developed, tested and deployed. Current solutions do not offer sufficient performances. Adsorption processes are promising alternatives for capturing CO2 from power plants and other energy intensive industries as cement, steel, or petrochemical industries. In this regard, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a widely studied class of porous adsorbents that offer tremendous potential, owing to their large CO2 adsorption capacity and high CO2 affinity. However, the performances of MOF-based carbon capture technologies have not been fully evaluated. MOF4AIR gathers 14 partners from 8 countries to develop and demonstrate the performances of MOF-based CO2 capture technologies in power plants and energy intensive industries. After identifying the best MOFs in WP1 and validating them through tests (e.g. stability and selectivity) in WP2, the most promising will be produced at larger scale and shaped in WP3. WP4 will conduct simulations to study MOFs behaviours in two adsorption processes: VPSA and MBTSA and optimise them. Both solutions will be tested at lab scale in WP5. In WP6, 3 demonstration sites across Europe will prove the cost-efficiency and reliability of MOF-based carbon capture in CO2 intensive sectors: power supply, refineries and waste incineration. To ensure a wide development of the solutions developed, WP7 will focus on techno-economic analysis, LCA and WP8 on social acceptance and replicability. MOF4AIR aims to foster the uptake of CCS technologies by providing a TRL6-reliable solution matching end users' needs, notably by cutting CCS energy penalty by more than 10%.

Rooted in older boat building traditions from Ijwi (lake Kivu) and Nioki (on the Mfimi River), and powered by fossil-fuelled Chinese two-stroke Diesel engines, baleinières combine local traditions of craftsmanship with transnational South-South technology translation “from below”.
The research aims 1. to trace the baleinières’ chaîne opératoire of materials and skills in time and space, from the cutting of trees and the recycling of materials (tar, corrugated aluminium sheets, etc.), to the repairing and maintenance of the Chang Fa Diesel propulsion system; 2. to investigate the material and spiritual lives and ontologies of fossil-fuelled internal combustion engines (ICEs) in the realm of African river transportation, which have been crucially overlooked by anthropologists so far.

Of particular concern are 1) the huge volume of landfilled spent refractory, about 80-90% of total ladles and furnaces demolition material; and 2) the massive lime consumption, generating large amounts of CO2 emissions.
To date no technology existed in the steel industry that achieved recycling rates higher than about 50%, can be performed in situ and permit the use of the vast majority of treated waste within the same production cycle. These assets would significantly reduce economic and environmental costs of steel production. 
Deref S.p.a.

As recognised by the European Commission, island energy is expensive, polluting, inefficient and dependent on external
supply, with significant negative impacts on emissions, the competitiveness of businesses, and the economy. Existing
renewable alternatives are often unsuitable for these communities, such as wind and solar power, as the energy they
generate is unpredictable and intermittent, making it difficult to rely on. Tidal energy is also often unsuitable, as it requires
fast tidal flows (over 2.5m/s) which only occur in a few specific hot spots around the World.

Solution: Deep Green Island Mode
The Deep Green Island Mode (DGIM) is a stand-alone tidal and ocean current energy converter for off- grid applications.
DGIM is based on the concept of flying an underwater kite, that when steered in an 8-shaped trajectory, generates a speed
of 8-10 times the speed of the actual current.
- Generates cost effective electricity in tidal flows as low as 1.2 m/s
- Generates up to 100kW, producing an estimated 0,35 GWh/year, enough to power 100 homes
- Can be located close to the shore
- Up to 15 times lighter per kW compared to other tidal energy solutions
- Easy, low cost installation and maintenance (low CapEx and OpEx)
- Cost of energy 60% lower than diesel generators
DG Island Mode offers cheap, clean, reliable electricity generation to island communities.
Recently we have completed our phase 1 feasibility study which has quantified the significant, global market for DGIM.

The aim of the DGIM2 project is to install the first two commercially viable DGIMs in a production and customer environment
on the Faroe Islands. Successful demonstration of DGIM will act as a first step to developing commercial ties with utilities

In fact, diesel generators supply 98% of the electrical power required in construction sites. These generators are usually over-sized in order to cover all power peaks while working at low loads most of the time (<50% of their capacity). Unfortunately, diesel generators have a very poor efficiency at low load levels which causes a waste of tremendous amounts of fuel along with increased emissions. Working at low levels also reduces the service life of the generator and entails high engine-servicing costs. 
xelectrix Power GmbH is an Austrian company specialized in construction equipment with energy-efficient drive technology. Strove by the need for a solution that would combine electric energy storage and grid stabilization and could work in parallel with any kind of energy source (renewable or not), we have developed Power Box: a “plug & play” energy storage system (battery pack and hybrid inverter – patent pending) that can work in parallel with any energy source (alternating AC or direct current DC) including diesel generators, renewables and the grid suiting the needs of construction sites and bigger operations.  With Power Box, diesel generators and the grid always operate at optimal efficiency. During peak energy requirements, Power Box and the generator combine to meet these requirements while during periods of low loads, the power is taken directly from Power Box’s battery storage. 
Through this project, we aim to set the technical and commercial bases of Power Box optimization to then by mid-2021 commercialize it among construction companies who already own diesel generators and energy who need energy storage and stabilization solutions. By the lack of adequate competing solutions on the market along with the growing demand of power supply, we expect to sell at least 3,900 Power Box units in 5 years to generate €119M revenues (ROI 7.86).",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,XELECTRIX POWER GMBH,AT,,,

Current PET disposal options include incineration, landfilling and recycling while a relevant amount is still dumped into oceans. Landfilling and incineration are however outdated since environmentally unsustainable. Recycling is the preferred option, but a series of technological barriers limit the recycling into high-quality rPET (recycled PET).
The ChemPET project aims to scale-up a cutting-edge chemical recycling technology, based on glycolysis, for PET based waste converting it into monomer BHET.
Currently, there are no alternatives which guarantee efficient results at industrial scale considering heterogeneous PET feedstock. BHET can be newly used as raw material in the production of virgin PET instead of the terephthalic acid (TPA) and the ethylene glycol (EG) that derive from crude oil. This determines advantages for the PET value chain in terms of environmental sustainability, competitiveness and job creation. ChemPET will help Europe to achieve the “Zero Plastics to landfill by 2025”, promoting the Circular Economy and reducing Europe dependency on fossil feedstocks. ChemPET project foresees the technical improvement of ChemPET technology and the valorisation of by-products.
After the optimization of the BHET production phase, GARBO will collaborate with many stakeholders across plastic industry value chain to maximize the business opportunities and foster the uptake of ChemPET technology. The production of chemical recycled PET (crPET) from BHET will close the loop supporting the growth of the circular economy thus reshaping the PET value chain at whole. Large occupational benefits are expected by the replication of ChemPET process.

They are also required to enable the use of more (typically intermittent) renewable energy, to balance demand with generation. This proposal seeks to develop and apply new NMR metrologies to determine the structure and dynamics of the multiple electrode-electrolyte interfaces and interphases that are present in these batteries, and how they evolve during battery cycling. New dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) techniques will be exploited to extract structural information about the interface between the battery electrode and the passivating layers that grow on the electrode materials (the solid electrolyte interphase, SEI) and that are inherent to the stability of the batteries.  The role of the SEI (and ceramic interfaces) in controlling lithium metal dendrite growth will be determined in liquid based and all solid state batteries. 
New DNP approaches will be developed that are compatible with the heterogeneous and reactive species that are present in conventional, all-solid state, Li-air and redox flow batteries. Method development will run in parallel with the use of DNP approaches to determine the structures of the various battery interfaces and interphases, testing the stability of conventional biradicals in these harsh oxidizing and reducing conditions, modifying the experimental approaches where appropriate. The final result will be a significantly improved understanding of the structures of these phases and how they evolve on cycling, coupled with strategies for designing improved SEI structures. The nature of the interface between a lithium metal dendrite and ceramic composite will be determined, providing much needed insight into how these (unwanted) dendrites grow in all solid state batteries. DNP approaches coupled with electron spin resonance will be use, where possible in situ, to determine the reaction mechanisms of organic molecules such as quinones in organic-based redox flow batteries in order to help prevent degradation of the electrochemically active species.    

This proposal involves NMR method development specifically designed to explore a variety of battery chemistries. Thus, this proposal is interdisciplinary, containing both a strong emphasis on materials characterization, electrochemistry and electronic structures of materials, interfaces and nanoparticles, and on analytical and physical chemistry.  Some of the methodology will be applicable to other materials and systems including (for example) other electrochemical technologies such as fuel cells and solar fuels and the study of catalysts (to probe surface structure).",3498219.0,3498219.0,ERC-2018-ADG,ERC-ADG,THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARSOF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,UK,,,

In the past 3 years, the team at WIMAO has put our careers in recycling to use by developing REMAT: a patented technology to turn non-recyclable mixed plastic waste streams and other non-recycled materials into composite products. Our products have the full consistency and the same physical properties as composites produced with virgin raw materials. Beyond that, the end products we manufacture are recyclable at the end of their life cycle creating an infinite loop.
We have set up a pilot REMAT facility that started production in January 2019. We are turning mixed plastic waste that is not wanted by the plastic recycling industry and wood waste into, composite products.
The total available raw material (waste streams) for our products is calculated in billions of tons, giving us a nearly unlimited growth potential. If the capacity of our REMAT plants were to match this potential supply, we could ideally replace all composite products on the market with our recycled composite raw material.
WIMAO is uniquely positioned to create a new standard operating mode for the recycling industry. Our breakthrough has been creating high-value materials from many mixed inputs, effectively surmounting the key barrier for recycling: the need to separate waste streams. We have the only technology versatile enough to handle the volumes of waste that Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) collect, exactly as they receive it.

In the agri-food industry and wastewater treatment plants, anaerobic digestion is a proven technology for treatment of wet-waste biomass, which allows generation of biogas as renewable energy. Additionally, biogas can be upgraded into biomethane and CO2, which are organic carbon sources which can be used as raw materials for manufacturing graphene in a circular economy approach: biographene.
We are Biogenera Renovables, and we have developed a plug-and-play solution for producing graphene from biomethane in biogas plants via Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). We have a working prototype of the technology (now TRL6) in collaboration with PlanarTech, another R&D intensive SME key in graphene industrialisation, and we are finetuning an innovative business model to have a long-term leadership.
Our business model consists in partnering with biogas plants to install our Biographene Production Unit in their premises, as well as sharing the profits of the sales. It will allow graphene production to be economically viable at industrial scale and simultaneously is a way to increase the profitability of biogas plants and boost the renewable energy sector. To market it, we will explore how to collaborate with PlanarTech.
Our breakthrough technology coupled with the business model proposed has the potential of transforming the industrial production of graphene, whose high-quality production will be sold to technological industry, and its low-quality fraction will be sold to packaging industry, which is currently highly interested in incorporating graphene to strengthen their materials (reinforcing paper pulp for bags).

Due to the required high investment and operational costs of current technologies, many industries find more economical to pay fines for direct discharges of polluted effluents than to treat them. Particularly, the heterogeneity and seasonality of the agro-food sector produce a broad variety of wastewater streams which claim for more efficient and customizable solutions to meet with increasingly stringent wastewater regulations.
Within this context, Ingeobras and Proycon have developed ANAERGY, a modulable wastewater treatment system that integrates for the first time: anaerobic, aerobic and advanced oxidation stages. The exclusive design of the anaerobic digester, including patented PUREMUST® technology, enable to reach high pollutants elimination rates (95-99%) and production of biogas (16 m3/m3). Also, its small size and flexibility allow reducing installation and operational costs, together with a tailored response to end-user´s requirements. Following their collaboration for 12 years, Ingeobras will manage technical upgrades, assembly, commercialization and installation, while Proycon will be in charge of manufacturing the digesters. 
The adoption of ANAERGY by industries lead to major economic savings by eliminating wastewater discharge fees and reducing energy costs (biogas ≈80% energy needs). The benefits that ANAERGY will bring to the market will make the proposed project profitable with a ROI of 6.6 over 4 years and a payback period by the 1st quarter of the second year.

The Incoming Researcher is a highly dedicated and motivated young researcher and has been stimulated to devise this novel design. Solar thermal collection and photovoltaics are the dominating technologies, however, the combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technology is expected to become popular due to its higher overall efficiency, more cost effective and better match with building energy demand as well. Integration of radiative cooling into a PV/T collector can further contribute to such merits by adding a night sky cooling function, so a RC-PV/T collector can produce electricity and heat during the daytime and provide cooling during the nighttime. To achieve such triple functions, the applicants have analysed and proposed the ideal spectral selective characteristics of the RC-PV/T panel, and a desirable RC-PV/T micro/nano coating as well as a RC-PV/T collector will be designed and trial-manufactured.

The largest share consists of distributed and small-scale systems. The increased variability of supply from distributed renewable generations such as, wind and solar photovoltaics causes frequency and voltage stability issues in the system. Moreover, the power electronic interfaces reduces the system inertia which can lead to severe frequency deviations if a proper control mechanism is not implemented. However, an energy storage system and demand response with non-dispatchable generations will reduce the variability and thus, improve the system resilience by providing energy arbitrage, frequency and voltage regulation and fast reserves which are beneficial to distribution network management. Although the small-scale distributed sources are not capable to provide these flexibility services to the distribution and transmission network operators, the aggregator in the modern distribution network enables this process. Besides, they are able to provide slow services such as peak shaving, demand side management. GiFlex tackles this aspect by proposing an optimization framework in the smart grid scenario.

The PivotBuoy system combines the advantages of Single Point Mooring systems (SPM - pre-installation of the mooring and connection system using small vessels) with those of tension-leg systems (TLPs - weight reduction, reduced mooring length and enhanced stability), enabling a radical weight reduction of 50% to 90% in floating wind systems compared to current spar and semi-submersible systems but also enabling a critical simplification in the installation of traditional TLP systems. 
The PivotBuoy concept, initially conceived by its founder while at MIT, is currently at TRL3 after the proof of concept in a wave tank at 1:64 scale and it is the result of years of experience. The project proposes validating the concept at PLOCAN test site, integrating a part-scale prototype of the PivotBuoy single point mooring system in a 225kW downwind floating platform developed by X1 WIND. By testing in a relevant environment, the project will also validate critical innovations related to assembly, installation and O&M techniques, reaching TRL5 at the project end. 
The impact of the proposed innovations is sector wide: the system can be integrated not only in X1 WIND downwind platform but in any other floating platforms using single point moorings systems in the wind and in other sectors such as wave energy, tidal and oil&gas industries.

There is an on-going debate on the selection of the more effective technologies that could contribute to system flexibility. This category doesn’t only include grid technologies, but also storage elements and flexible demand, both located in transmission or provided by opportunely aggregated distributed energy sources located in distribution networks. 
FlexPlanning aims at creating a new tool for optimizing transmission and distribution grid planning, considering the placement of flexibility elements as an alternative to traditional grid planning. This approach aims at helping to reduce overall power system costs i.e. infrastructure deployment and operation costs, the latter in terms of procurement of energy and system services. 
FlexPlan is going to take into account environmental impact and footprint (impact on air quality for thermal generation, carbon footprint, impact on landscape of new T&D lines). 
A pre-processing tool is also created to determine location, size and associated costs for storage and flexible demand candidates. 
The new planning tool is first validated and then used for analysing six detailed regional scenarios at 2030-2040-2050 in order to assess the potential role of storage and flexible resources.

Microalgal biomass is frequently rich in fatty acids, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins such as riboflavin, thiamine, carotene and folic acid, among others are of high value. From the above, this project proposes the bioethanol production from a biomass mixture of the microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis and lignocellulosic hydrolysate sugarcane bagasse, focusing on the development of a fermentation technology to convert the pentoses and hexoses present in the biomass to bioethanol.",98507.52,98507.52,H2020-WF-01-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,INSTITUTO SUPERIOR DE ENGENHARIA DO PORTO,PT,,,

Therefore, essential grid planning and operation workflows involve significant manual input.

Additionally, Smart Grid Technologies cannot be used to their full extent to avoid curtailment of renewables in congestion management, and to substitute conventional expensive grid capacity expansions.
We have developed the Intelligent Grid Platform (IGP), the only integral software solution using machine learning algorithms to allow grid operators to reduce their operational and network expansion investment costs by giving them the means to clean and connect their data, digitize and automate their grid planning and operation activities and to more easily integrate smart grid technologies to help their operation processes and avoid expensive network capacity extensions.

The over-arching aim is to catalyse increased research into parametric resonance (PR) within wave energy and other offshore renewable energy fields. 

The concept of resonance is well known in the study of wave energy converters (WECs). In comparison, PR has received virtually no attention, and is often unexpected since it is a nonlinear phenomenon not predicted by the linear/frequency domain models traditionally favoured in WEC research and analysis. Whereas normal resonance causes the oscillations of a system to grow linearly with time, PR causes an exponential increase in oscillation amplitude, and therefore has great potential to be either detrimental or beneficial to a WEC performance. For certain classes of WECs, PR can lead WEC instability and decreased performance, by transferring energy from the primary mode of motion into other modes. Alternatively, for other types of WECs designed to extract power from the parametrically resonating modes of motion, triggering PR could result in increased energy capture and represent a game-changing approach to improving WEC performance.

To achieve the over-arching goal, the project focuses on the following  specific objectives:
1) Demonstrate novel control techniques to either mitigate or harness PR for different classes of WECs.  
2) Provide opensource tools for modelling and analysing PR in WECs, to aide the wave energy community in overcoming the barriers surrounding the advanced nonlinear methods required to investigate PR.

However, the marine environment also imposes a number of constraints and challenges.

The REACT proposal will address the management of waste acrylic textiles coming from outdoor awnings and furnishing. A clue issue is the analysis and removal of finishing substances (fluorocarbons, melamine and acrylic resins, anti-mold agents) that affect the secondary raw material purity and their management. Then a mechanical recycling process will be implemented to obtain second life fiber and fabrics, which performance will be tested for best application.
A full environment friendly process to remove hazardous materials on finishing of waste acrylic textile will be investigated and developed to enhance their recycling, improve sustainability and reduce environmental and health risk.

Owing to the exceptional stability of molecular nitrogen’s triple bond the Haber-Bosch process is an energy intensive chemical process which accounts for 1-2 % of the world's energy production, consumes 2-3 % of the global natural gas output and emits more than 300 million tonnes of CO2. In light of an increasing population (and fertilizer demand) coupled with an urgency to reduce CO2 emissions, efforts to find alternative technologies for NF that offer the potential of reduced energy usage while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated. Electrically powered plasma processes are considered as a promising alternative for delocalized fertilizer production, based on renewable energy, and more specifically for NO production. To-date, however, plasma designs for NF have not exceeded Haber-Bosch efficiencies. Pulsed powered microwave (MW) generated plasma technology offers some promise in this regard. Pulsing of the discharge power enables strategies which direct energy to primarily heat electrons (’non-thermal’ conditions) providing a far more efficient pathway to molecular bond breakage (and resulting NO production) than thermal effects. Indeed, reports on pulsed powered MW discharges have indicated an opportunity to tune electron energies to maximize molecular vibrational excitation, identified as an optimal route for energy efficiency in NO production.

•	Adaptability, upgradability, and reparability 
•	User behaviour and market

The THERM project focuses on the investigation of heat transport and associated thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes occurring during the lifetime of a geothermal reservoir. Fractured reservoirs, such as those found in enhanced geothermal systems, are characterized by a strong hydraulic and transport complexity coming from the fractures’ surface roughness, from their arrangement in networks, and from the interaction of the fractures with the surrounding rocks. As a result, the characteristics of the hydro-thermal flow which occurs when a cold fluid is injected into a hot fractured rock mass are controlled by fracture network discontinuities and properties of fracture surfaces themselves.

Manufacturing these optoelectronic devices at a large scale involves concerns at technological, economical, ecological, social and political levels. Ideally, the new materials are abundant, easily processed and feature long term stability and non-toxicity. The advent of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). e.g., MoS2 and WS2, has generated great expectations since these materials fulfill all these requirements. 2D-TMDCs exhibit direct band gaps, high absorption coefficients, and high carrier mobility values, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. The out-of-plane quantum confinement responsible for the direct bandgap in the monolayer, also allows for the modulation of the bandgap as a function of the number of layers. However, for photovoltaics (PV), even if transparency is an important attribute in some niche markets, e.g. building-integrated PV, thickness-limited absorption poses a challenge in general.

Condensing sCO2 cycles have higher thermal-to-electricity conversion efficiency with respect to conventional steam and sCO2 cycles.In addition, higher maximum operating temperature with respect to steam cycles can be adopted with further efficiency increase. The combination of these two aspects enables drastic reductions of the levelised cost of electricity In the project, CO2 blends stable at temperatures up to 700°C (which corresponds to 100°C above current CSP maximum temperatures) and with a pseudocritical temperature of about 50°C will be investigated.

Recent research suggests that the fish biomass in the mesopelagic ecosystem might be 10 times higher than previously thought, and therefore represent 90 % of the fish biomass of the planet. However, this estimate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty in the fraction of the community that is fish. The potential high biomass has raised interest in its exploitation, mainly as a fish meal, but other potential exploitation pathways for high value compounds, such as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals, are possible. Nevertheless, if the biomass is as high as estimated, mesopelagic fish may play a key role in ecosystem services, such as sustaining other commercially relevant species and carbon sequestration. SUMMER will establish a protocol to accurately estimate mesopelagic fish biomass, quantify the ecosystem services provided by the mesopelagic community (food, climate regulation and potential for bioactive compounds) and develop a decision support tool to measure the trade-offs between the different services. Combining eDNA with in situ acoustics and trawls SUMMER will obtain an accurate assessment of the composition and biomass of the mesopelagic community. Gut content analysis, molecular markers and stable isotopes will allow quantification of the vertically integrated trophic network, linking to commercial and charismatic species.

Such materials are highly desirable for many rotating and airborne engineering applications but often suffer from prohibitive brittleness, particularly in fatigue. The project applies a combination of nanoscale strain mapping techniques recently developed by the host institution, and by Dr. Edwards, on novel in-situ meso- and micro-mechanical fatigue testing setups, to study deformation behaviour upon fatigue loading. Currently, the European hub plays a central role in the research and development of advanced gamma titanium aluminide alloys, such as for improved processability, and the large-scale production of γ-TiAl components. However, no significant improvements have been made to the fatigue properties of the lightweight γ-TiAl alloys in the past few decades, effectively limiting their widespread application in higher volume industries where they could result in considerable increases in fuel efficiency. Similarly, Mg aluminides, such as the γ-Mg17Al12 phase, possess outstanding strength to weight properties; given sufficient improvements to their toughness and fatigue performance, they would be excellent candidates for structural components in future, more ecologically friendly, aero-propulsion technologies where the operational temperatures are lower than gas turbine engines (e.g. electric and hybrid-electric).

Geo-Drill fluidic amplifier driven hammer is less sensitive to issues with mud and tolerances, less impact of erosion on hammer efficiency and it continues to operate with varying mud quality in efficient manner.

A major challenge for the research community, therefore, is to find effective (policy) solutions for addressing the environmental and health problems caused by E-waste management in low and mid-income countries while, at the same time, enhancing the recovery of precious metals to reuse these resources. During my Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship, I will analyse why emerging economies adopt E-waste policies that seem inadequate and ineffective in their local contexts and identify alternative approaches. In a first step, I will develop a novel analytical framework to analyse the effectiveness of E-waste policies in emerging economies and, as a second step, I will seek to explain the degree of effectiveness of E-waste policies in India and South Africa. The research aims to make conceptual, empirical and policy-relevant contributions: I strive to contribute to the academic literature by developing a novel analytical framework that helps evaluate E-waste policies in non-Western countries. Current literature on E-waste is largely based on assumptions derived from Western policies, polities and societies. By analysing the cases of India and South Africa, my research will focus on two countries whose E-waste policy has hardly been analysed. The findings of the project will provide insights that both the EU and non-European policymakers can use in their decision- making. The EU has a keen interest in supporting non-EU countries tackle their E-waste challenges through effective policies, especially since parts of the E-waste that causes problems in those countries originates from the EU and is a direct result of European consumption. I will contribute to the understanding of how such EU support could be designed.",178320.0,178320.0,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN,BE,,,

Accurate and computationally fast mathematical models are essential tools for effectively and reliably designing wave energy converters (WECs). Although WEC dynamics are typically very nonlinear, linear (imprecise) models are extensively used due to their computational convenience; in contrast, nonlinear models currently available are more accurate but too slow for design optimisation or control applications. 

This fellowship purports to develop, validate, and disseminate a novel class of nonlinear models, which will realise an unprecedented pairing of accuracy and computational speed (100 to 1000 times faster than homologous existing models). Conversely to other, slower nonlinear models, this novel model can facilitate effective design and optimisation of the device, enable real-time power optimisation and model-based control. The project will greatly impact the wave energy community, making a high-performance modelling tool easily accessible to any stakeholder for a variety of advanced design purposes. This project is comprised of 3 work packages, which accomplish: (1) validation of the model for axisymmetric devices, (2) expansion and validation of the model for pitching platform devices, and (3) enhancement of computation performance and release of an open-source software. In addition, this fellowship will expand the career horizons of the fellow: a highly multidisciplinary plan is defined, building upon and extending beyond his current competencies.

This fellowship aims to control the parametric resonance of WEC dynamics to improve energy conversion efficiency, based on a 1/20 scale prototype. The research objectives (ROs) are: RO1: Identify a high-fidelity and computation-effective model to represent the WEC parametric resonance with CFD verification in OpenFOAM (open source) and parametric analysis in MATLAB. RO2: Develop advanced nonlinear control strategies and corresponding PTO mechanism for actuation, to improve WEC efficiency making use of its multi-DoF motion and parametric resonance. RO3: Conduct tank testing to verify the modelling of parametric resonance (RO1), and model-based control design and implementation (RO2), based on a self-assembled 1/20 scale prototype.

Besides providing substrate and habitat for numerous other algae and sessile invertebrates, their ability to calcify, their high abundance and biomass, makes rhodoliths major carbonate producers. Recent empirical estimations suggest that the carbonate marine deposits generated by these organisms represent a total potential carbon sink of 0.4 x 109 t C yr-1. Hence, giving the increasing role of marine ecosystems in the storage of blue carbon, rhodolith beds may represent a not yet considered significant carbon store. Regarding carbon sequestration, studies on rhodolith bed community metabolism are scarce and so far only available for two temperate beds that indicate that they can act both as CO2 source and organic carbon sink. As many marine ecosystems, rhodolith beds are currently under threat related to global climate change (GCC), with local impacts due to increasing coastal urbanization, potentially lowering even further their resilience. Thus, by using a physiological approach, this project will provide much needed information on the basic mechanistic understanding of rhodolith metabolism (photosynthesis, calcification), rhodolith responses to global and local stressors, and rhodolith bed community metabolism and carbon storage along a latitudinal gradient. Taken together, this information will allow assessing the importance of rhodolith beds as natural carbon sinks, thus, help ascertain whether these ecosystems meet the requirements to be integrated into climate mitigation policy, and will further allow quantifying the effects of GCC on their carbon sequestration and storage ability.

MODALES will contribute to a substantial reduction in air pollution from all types of motorised road vehicles by encouraging the adoption of low-emission oriented driving behaviour and maintenance choice, improving the effectiveness of OBD devices and retrofits. The main goal of MODALES is to advance the fundamental understanding of the co-variability of user behaviour and vehicular emissions from  powertrain, brakes and tyres, and modify user behaviour via dedicated training, including a driver assistance app and awareness campaigns, in order to support effective air quality plans and enforcement strategies to be developed by local and national authorities. 
MODALES proposes a user-centric approach to addressing all of the challenges which on the one hand enhance low-emission practices and on the other hand suppress high-emission behaviour by researching, developing and testing a number of innovative and complementary solutions in four key areas (namely, Driver, Retrofits, EOBD and Inspection) in order to substantially reduce vehicle emissions from 3 main sources (i.e. powertrain, brake wear and tyre wear).
The results will be used as evidence with adequate quality to guide the derivation of effective driving practices and training courses for different user groups.

The design and control of such networks is becoming increasingly complex, due to their growing size, heterogeneity and autonomy. A systematic theory and methodology for control of large-scale interconnected systems is therefore needed. In an ambitious effort towards this goal, this project will develop rigorous tools for control synthesis, adaptation and verification. 

Many large-scale systems exhibit properties that have not yet been systematically exploited by the control community. One such property is positive (or monotone) system dynamics. This correspond to the property that all states of a network respond in the same direction when the demand or supply is perturbed in some node. Scalable methods for control of positive systems are starting to be developed, but several fundamental questions remain: How can existing results be extended to scalable synthesis of dynamic controllers? Can results for linear positive systems be extended to nonlinear monotone ones? How about systems with resonances? 

The second focus area, adaptation, takes advantage of recent progress in machine learning, such as statistical concentration bounds and approximate dynamic programming. Adaptation is of fundamental importance for scalability, since high-fidelity models are very expensive to generate manually and hard to maintain. Thirdly, since systematic procedures for control synthesis generally rely on simplified models and idealized assumptions, we will also develop scalable methods to bound the effect of imperfections, such as nonlinearities, time-variations and parameter uncertainty that are not taken into account in the original design. 

The research will be carried out in interaction with industry studying a new concept for district heating networks. This collaboration will give access to experimental data from a full scale demonstration plant.",2500000.0,2500000.0,ERC-2018-ADG,ERC-ADG,LUNDS UNIVERSITET,SE,,,

In this regard, the GANDALF project proposes the design of gamification and datafication solutions, which aims at improvement of learning outcomes in the context of forecasting course and demonstrate a world view based on facts. GANDALF aims to experimentally investigate gamification effects on educational process of a forecasting techniques’ course by addressing three novel objectives: (1) Design, implement and use a web-based, modular, educational platform in order to teach exploratory data analytics (module 1) and forecasting time series methods (module 2); (2) Investigate behavioural and psychological effects of individual affordances on learning exploratory analysis and promote fact-based world-view; (3) Examine behavioural and psychological outcomes in the context of a forecasting time series methods course. GANDALF employs controlled experimental research methods, with pre-, post-test design and forecasting problems to gain knowledge on the gamification effect on learning, user-experience and users’ forecasting accuracy based on their characteristics as well.

It is therefore urgent to develop innovative photovoltaic (PV) technologies and products, and to implement them massively. Among emerging photovoltaics, Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are competitive in terms of efficiency, cost, and more importantly stability. They can be made semi-transparent which is an appealing feature for building or automobile integrated photovoltaics. But to be efficient, they have to harvest a maximum of photons from the sun, thus the best-performing DSSCs cannot show a good transparency which impedes their use as windows. 
In 2017, I proposed a new concept to combine photochromism and photovoltaic, leading for the first time to efficient semi-transparent solar cells showing variable and self-adjustable optical transmission. These cells can simultaneously adapt their absorption depending on the weather conditions and produce electricity. 
Starting from this result, PISCO will widely explore this exciting concept and provide a breakthrough in photovoltaics by developing a novel class of multifunctional solar cells that could be massively integrated in buildings, automotive, or mobile electronics.
The main objectives of PISCO are:
1) Design and synthesis of novel photochromic dyes with optimized optoelectronic properties and high stability. 
2) Integration of these molecules in devices using methodologies to enable fundamental studies, to fully understand what factors are governing the photochromic behaviour, the generation of electrical power, and the interplay between them. 
3) Inspired by the most relevant and recent concepts in the field, to develop robust and efficient photochromic solar cells and modules.

Since these processes take place at pore scale, direct pore scale experimental measurements are needed to gain comprehensive understanding of them. The aim of UnsatPorMix is thus to elucidate the impact of structural pore-scale heterogeneity on solute spreading/mixing and reaction rates during unsaturated flow, through the combination of micromodel experiments and numerical model simulations. In the first stage of UnsatPorMix, experiments in micromodels with varying degrees of heterogeneity will provide unprecedented results on the phenomenology of pore-scale mechanisms and their effect on solute spreading and mixing. In the second stage, the experimental measurements of phase distribution and solute concentrations, combined to numerically-computed pore scale velocities, will be used to design and validate a pore-scale model for solute transport in these porous media. This model will allow obtaining a large representative numerical data set, enabling statistical analysis and the derivation of quantitative relations between structural heterogeneity and solute transport/mixing.

However, when released to the environment they can persist for centuries. One pillar of a responsible future economy is therefore to endow important plastics with a non-persistent nature. Polyethylene (PE) is the largest scale synthetic material, used in transportation, energy storage, water cleaning, clothing and many other fields. However, it is most problematic concerning degradability.  This proposal addresses this major challenge by introducing photo- and hydrolytically degradable groups in the PE chain. Directly during catalytic PE synthesis, isolated keto groups will be generated by incorporation of small amounts of carbon monoxide. This yet unachieved goal is targeted via catalysts with extreme shielding and rigid ligand environments in heterobimetallic Ni(II) / main group metal complexes.

Living catalytic polymerization in nanoparticles is pursued to achieve ultra high molecular weights and gradient PE chains forming nanodomains varying in ketone density. Aqueous heterophase oxidation with benign oxidants on all these nanoparticle will yield in-chain ester groups. Further types of hydrolytically cleavable groups are targeted via the complementary synthetic approach of step growth from seed- or microalgae-oil derived PE-telechelics. This yields linear PE with in-chain carbonate, acetal and anhydride groups. Basic materials properties of all polymers are determined by tensile tests.

The approach to harnessing the intricate phenomena causing critical performance degradation will be based upon a methodical analysis of in-service performance data correlated with post-operation states, augmented by a dual-focus campaign targeting macroscopic stack testing procedures as well as specific component ageing tests. The probabilistic nature of degradation will be captured by slimming down deterministic simulation models through conception and integration of stochastic correlations between (nominal/accelerated) operating conditions and degradation effects, based on statistically significant data obtained from field-tests and purposely generated experiments. Stochastic interpretation will thus serve the physical description of dominant SOFC degradation mechanisms in CHP and P2X operation, but allowing rapid estimation of remaining useful stack life. 
The combined results will be translated to validated test protocols that allow quantifying and predicting degradation in SOCs as a function of test aggravation, defining appropriate transfer functions between stress-accelerating and real-world conditions.

The success of the project will be driven by the combination of two strong and complementary areas of expertise: At Imperial and IMDEA, the fellow will work for 24 months in groups with an extensive experience of carbon and inorganic nanomaterials synthesis, modification, characterisation, and application, particularly on hierarchical systems. On the other hand, she will bring her own experience in developing and characterising electrodes and electrolytes for a wide range of batteries as well as supercapacitors. The interdisciplinary intersection of new materials chemistry, with electrochemical device engineering, and structural composite mechanisms, will provide a unique opportunity for rapid progress in both science and technology. The structural energy storage devices will be developed from technology readiness level 1 and to 4, in order to accelerate direct impact on industrial applications, for example in the automotive and electronics sectors.

However, seagrass meadows are affected by global climate change and anthropogenic stressors such as eutrophication and coastal development. Yet, the mechanistic interactions between these ecosystems and environmental change remain unclear due to the complexity of studying the seagrass habitat, which exhibit a multitude of chemical gradients and dynamics. The requirement for high-resolution measurement techniques for resolving the biogeochemical dynamics and microenvironments surrounding seagrasses in their natural habitat has led to the development of a variety of chemical techniques typically quantifying a single analyte at a time, which gives limited insight to the true dynamics of the seagrass-sediment interaction which is central for seagrass fitness and survival under environmental change. The SIPODET project will develop new multi-parameter chemical imaging techniques by combining luminescence-based optical sensor foils (planar optodes) with diffusional equilibrium in thin-film (DET) enabling simultaneous sensing of pO2, iron, phosphate, nitrite/nitrate, ammonium, manganese, pCO2 and pH. This project will encompass expert training of Dr. Cesbron in the use of planar optodes complementing his expertise in 2D DET mapping of chemical species, which will enable the development of a novel combined chemical imaging technology mentored by a world leader in microenvironmental analysis.

The produced glasses will be thermally and electrochemically characterized in order to investigate their sinter-crystallization behaviour (tailoring suitable sintering treatments) and electrochemical performances. The most promising electrolyte compositions will be selected to be printed in free-form robust self-standing structures in order to obtain 3D batteries with high active area (allowing high specific energy and power per unit volume).

HY-NANO aims to realize a new low-cost and efficient hybrid solar technology combining long-term stability with a reduced environmental impact. Design and engineering innovative multi-dimensional hybrid interfaces is the core idea. This will be achieved by: 1. design and characterization of new stable and eco-friendly perovskites structures, with tunable composition and dimensionality ranging from 3D to 2D; 2. exploiting new synergistic functions by combining 3D and 2D perovskites together into novel stable and efficient multi-dimensional interfaces while addressing the interface physics therein; 3. integrating the hybrid interfaces into high efficient and stable device architectures engineered “ad hoc”.

The amount of plastics is immense and starts to play a significant role on World’s ecosystem. Most of the plastics are the packages. The problem has been addressed by some biodegradable solutions such as  bioplastic, paper or even bamboo containers. However, they still need at least half a year to degrade. From the other side, there is also immense amount of wheat bran which is a side product of the milling industry. The only use of that bran is feed for animals, otherwise it becomes waste in a few weeks. Hence, its efficient disposal is problematic, and - in result - bran has very low market value. Biotrem’s mission is to solve both the problems at the same time. We invented the proprietary technology which allows to use the wheat bran to make the containers. In this project we introduce water resistant and edible take-away food containers, which are biodegradable within 30 days - Branboxes. Currently, the major issue for the containers is the water resistance and biodegradability which is a great challenge to achieve at the same time in the single product. Bringing the product to the market at the small scale will not give the desired environmental results. Hence, we will introduce the scaled-up production (by licensing) and commercialization.  
The market for such biodegradable packaging is worth at the moment €11B and is quickly growing at the CAGR of 16%, and is going to reach €20B within next decade.  
Our end-users (each of us) will benefit from the plastic-free environment. Our customers – distributors, food chains and packaging producers, and mills will benefit from the new business opportunities. Our extensive distribution network will help us to fully exploit opportunities to commercialize the Branbox.

In fact, beside addressing current concerns with existing electricity systems (e.g., ageing infrastructure and increasing peak demand), smart grids are fundamental for the diffusion of low-carbon technologies, including electric vehicles and variable Renewable Energy Sources. 

Significant revenue losses are still experienced in the existing power networks, but the convergent advances in computing and ICT, the accelerating deployment of renewable generation and storage technologies offer new opportunities for advanced Operations and Maintenance Management (O&MM) to ensure more reliable, efficient and resilient power electric grids meeting environmental performance goals. 

Then, ARAMIS proposes the present Algo-Grid project, for deploying a platform for O&MM of power grids. 

ARAMIS was founded in 2012 in Milan, Italy, by a group of (PhD) researchers of the Politecnico di Milano. The mission of ARAMIS is to develop and deploy methods, models, techniques and algorithms for the analysis and optimization of industrial components and systems, particularly, in terms of safety, reliability, maintenance, resilience, asset management, etc.

Algo-Grid is based on specifically designed Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) solutions, time series prediction algorithms, energy flow simulators and optimization algorithms, which can provide real-time optimal configurations of smart grids (generation, transmission and distribution), predict and assess infrastructure health condition, incorporate policy-based rule logic.

A preliminary estimation yields a Return On Investement (ROI) of 4,63M€ for the years 2020-2024. Cumulative profits in 2024 deriving from direct sales in EU28 and target markets (including India, China and the USA) will total more than 9,03M€, exploiting a 25,78B€ business opportunity.

PlatoCure also includes online neuroimaging by electroencephalogram (EEG) that enables measuring of electrophysiological data during stimulation. This yields a significant advantage of PlatoCure against competition, strengthening market introduction to become the standard treatment device for moderate to severe depression, yielding benefits for a large group of stakeholders, including patients, medical professionals, hospitals and clinics.

The SME Ph1 will be crucial for: i) establishing partnerships with relevant stakeholders on an international level in the medical segment, ii) setting up a regulatory strategy and iii) developing a clear commercialisation strategy. Hereafter, PlatoScience will be able to start SME Ph 2 focusing on the clinical validation of the device with hospitals and clinics.

Currently produced from fossil-fuels (natural gas and coal), this artificial Nitrogen (NH3) can only be absorbed by plants once it is transformed by microorganisms into NO3-. However, during this biological process, up to 70% of N is lost into the soil, resulting in soil and water pollution. Only in Europe, the direct cost derived from this contamination has been quantified in around 14 billion/year.

VitalFluid, start-up with long expertise in plasma technology, has developed an innovative plasma nitrogen fixation unit -PLAN2FIX- able to extract N directly from the air and dissolve it into water on the spot, through our patented plasma activation technology. The resulting water (plasma activated water, PAW) is enriched in NO3-, which is readily absorbed by plants. PAW can be used as N-fertilizer and customized so that the exact amount of N the plant can absorb is delivered, and thus no N is lost into the environment.

Our N-enriched PAW is a sustainable and non-pollutant alternative to synthetic N-fertilizers that increases the uptake of nutrients by 20%, has an optimal acidity of pH 5,5 and active oxygen species that kill pathogens and serves as an extra oxygen nutrient. Besides, PLAN2FIX can be powered by renewable energy and connected to the irrigation system, providing a practically free zero-carbon PAW on the spot. No transport, storage, or distribution network is needed to supply farmers with our fertilizer, availability is ensured while price volatility (fossil-fuel price) avoided. Farmers will just need to invest in Plan2Fix units to have an unlimited source of liquid N-fertilizer, eliminating their dependence on suppliers and cutting costs by 48% per hectare/year (35% lower total cost).",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,VITALFLUID BV,NL,,,

A flexible and low cost production of photovoltaics in automated processes will be employed to produce PV modules as well as elements with integrated heat pipe based heat recovery. These active energy components will be combined with passive and sustainable components with structural, mechanical, thermal and other functions to produce prefabricated BIPV modules. Prefabrication will be the key to achieving cost reductions, as well as guaranteeing quick installation with low disruption.  The project will also employ a sustainable by design philosophy with all the parts of the system being recyclable/ reusable and waste based raw material supply chains will be established. A Smart Envelope System featuring grid connectivity, load prediction and shifting and intelligent energy management systems with predictive algorithms will be integrated in the PVadapt turn key BIPV system.  To convincingly demonstrate the PVadapt solutions, 7 buildings of various typologies (residential, commercial, 2 offices, and 3 service stations in Spain, Greece and Austria) will have the technology installed and one new 288m2 floor space construction will be built in Portugal with a total of 464kW installed. The LCOE  values will be below 2ct/kWh and the cost of the BIPV module will be below 200 euros per m2 and payback below 10 years.

The latter are placed at the forefront of the EU efforts for low-cost production and efficient consumption of electricity, a critical issue for a sustainable development.
In this context, the use of biomolecules as functional components in lighting and photovoltaic devices is still a challenge, as they quickly denature under storage and device operation conditions. This paradigm has changed using an innovative rubber-like material, in which the biofunctionality is long preserved. As a proof-of-concept, color down-converting rubbers based on fluorescent proteins were used to design the first biohybrid white light-emitting diode (bio-HWLED). To develop a new generation of biohybrid devices, InOutBioLight will address the following critical issues, namely i) the nature of the protein-matrix stabilization, ii) how to enhance the thermal/mechanical features, iii) how to design multifunctional rubbers, iv) how to mimic natural patterns for light-guiding, and v) how to expand the technological use of the rubber approach.
To achieve these goals, InOutBioLight involves comprehensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and mechanical studies to investigate the protein-matrix interaction using new polymer matrices, additives, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, the mechanical, thermal, and light-coupling features will be enhanced using structural biocompounds and reproducing biomorphic patterns. As such, InOutBioLight offers three major advances: i) a thorough scientific basis for the rubber approach, ii) a significant thrust of the emerging bio-HWLEDs, and iii) innovative breakthroughs beyond state-of-the-art biohybrid solar cells.",1999188.0,1999188.0,ERC-2018-COG,ERC-COG,FUNDACION IMDEA MATERIALES,ES,,,

The use of solar panels on large façade’s area is not yet a plausible solution since, with current technologies, it would result in dark closed buildings, while residents and workers seek glass facades to enjoy daylight. 
The Lumiduct is an innovative solution to generate renewable energy via the façade without having to compromise on transparency and design: a sun shading system made of transparent solar panels integrated into the building façade. The Lumiduct is the next step in making buildings energy-neutral.
During the day, the Lumiduct’s transparent solar panels automatically follow the position of the sun and at the same time filter the sunlight, converting the direct, blinding sunlight into energy, but letting diffuse, soft daylight through. During the night, an advanced version integrating LEDs makes it possible to create a beautiful atmosphere and communicate with the community. The Lumiduct creates awareness and makes living in and around the building a great experience.
The added value for the indoor climate is remarkable. Compared to a conventional automated sun shading system, the first results show that the Lumiduct system saves 24% on heating every year, 40% on cooling and 36% on lighting.

Over 50% of it produced out of collected waste such as aluminium scrap saving natural resources (bauxites) and energy. Since it requires only 5% of the energy required to produce the primary aluminum. Unfortunately, there is still large amount of aluminum waste (app 5.343 million tons p.a.)  going to landfill each year which is neither cost efficient nor neutral to our environment. Createc developed a breaking technology in the form of a recycling process which allows to bring the non-recyclable aluminum waste back into the market thus closing the production cycle. We show how to produce an aluminum foam to make aluminum foam panels. The panels are in the interest of vehicle parts manufacturers, designers, and architects. The foam panels are perfect as energy or noise absorbers and at the same time lightweight with an attractive look. Our technology is environmentally friendly, meaning that we eliminate any chemicals in the production process and we use only 1% of the energy required to produce the primary aluminum. Our panels will be offered in B2B model as two product types: 1) the standard of- the-shelf panels for e.g. architects available at retail shops, 2) as highly customized and specialized products for the hi-tech industry (automotive, aerospace).  The aluminum foam market is quickly growing at 7% CAGR and is worth at least €200M in the automotive and decorative markets. The market demand for our foams has been initially confirmed with big manufacturers of car parts, potential customers for energy/noise absorbing panels and architects. Within the Phase 1 project we aim at extending our knowledge of the business environment in our target markets, identify and seek for additional suppliers and customers, and evaluate viability of constructing our first production line.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,CREATEC SP ZOO,PL,,,

SPIDER’s advanced, low-cost (75 €/kWh by 2030) battery technology is predicted to bring energy density to ~ 450 Wh/kg by 2030 and power density to 800 W/kg. It operates at a lower, and thus safer, voltage, which enables the use of novel, highly conductive and intrinsically safe liquid electrolytes. Safety concerns will be further eliminated (or strongly reduced), as thermal energy dissipation will be reduced to 4 kW/kg, and thermal runaway temperature increased to over 200°C. Moreover, SPIDER overcomes one of the main Li-ion ageing mechanisms for silicon based anodes: notably, the loss of cyclable lithium, which should increase lifetime to 2000 cycles by 2022 for first life applications with further usefulness up to 5000 cycles in second life (stationary energy storage). In addition, SPIDER’s classic cell manufacturing process with liquid electrolyte will be readily transferable to industry, unlike solid electrolyte designs, which still require the development of complex manufacturing processes. Finally, SPIDER batteries will be designed to be 60% recyclable by weight, and a dedicated recycling process will be developed and evaluated during SPIDER. In addition, SPIDER materials significantly reduce the use of critical raw materials. Finally, four SPIDER partners are identified by the European Battery Alliance as central and strategic for the creation of the needed European battery value chain: SGL, NANO, VMI & SOLVAY.

Developing deep geothermal power plants requires the use of expensive and difficult to transport and operate heavy drilling machinery fit for oil and gas market purposes. As a result, up to 70% of the construction costs of geothermal plants are related to drilling. These costs are, in proportion, higher for small geothermal plants. As such, the potential of small-scale geothermal power is hindered where it is needed the most, in remote areas (e.g. rural region, islands) where currently highly polluting diesel generators are being used.
Qmatec is the Norwegian market leader in the supply of mobile drilling rigs. Having identified these needs we developed GeoTherm SWS; a compact, mobile and easy to transport drilling rig with a pioneering interchangeable drilling mechanism, able to conduct 3 drilling methods; core/diamond, rotation and Down-the-hole) allowing to reduce operating cost at a factor 3. Our uniquely light final product (2,100tn – 4 times lighter than existing solutions) has an up to 4 times lower final price. Thus, we achieve the reduction of drilling costs by 70% in small scale deep geothermal energy projects. Moreover, GeoTherm SWS makes possible the development of small geothermal projects even in isolated rural areas, reducing 90 % the carbon emissions otherwise caused by diesel generators.

Due to its low weight, low-tech design, simple installation and operations & maintenance, Wavepiston will be the disruptive technology that can make wave energy competitive with the other renewable energy sources.

Our prototype test and Phase 1 feasibility study have confirmed this potential. The Wavepiston system is easy to assemble on site by local staff and can be deployed from a regular tug boat, just like operations and maintenance can be carried out without expensive specialists.

In the Phase 2 project we will install a full-scale Wavepiston demonstration system to demonstrate the energy potential, durability and survivability ensuring a low cost per kWh.

In the first step our customer focus is islands and isolated coastal communities. We already have the first 4 commercial customers in the pipeline; Isola Piana at Sardinia, Ebeye at Marshall Islands, Siargao at the Philippines and the Alidhoo J-resort at the Maldives. During Phase 2 we will prepare the first commercial projects together with professional energy project developers. This will enable us to start the commercialisation right after the finalisation of Phase 2.

The Wavepiston technology is protected by several patents.

Powering these sensors creates a huge and urgent demand for smaller devices capable of harvesting energy from the environment and supplying the required power characteristics. Photovoltaic (PV) cells are attractive sources of renewable energy in illuminated environments, but their output voltage is limited to a few volts, whereas MEMS sensors often require higher voltages to operate. Such voltages can only be achieved by connecting several PV cells in series, or using large converters, two solutions that are prohibitive in terms of size and weight. Core-shell semiconductor nanowires (NWs) are ideal structures for efficient miniaturized PV cells, but lack of control in their assembly has prevented their integration in series.

Using the guided growth approach developed in our ERC Advanced project, we have succeeded to produce highly ordered planar arrays of NWs with exquisite structural control, which enabled us to create efficient PV cells and integrate them in series to multiply their open-circuit voltage to virtually any desired value. This power supply is expected to outperform all existing miniature power sources for the IoT by orders of magnitude. The aim of this PoC is to develop a prototype of a CMOS/MEMS-compatible high-voltage micro-PV cell based on series-connected core-shell NW arrays, and demonstrate its on-chip integration with a working microsystem.

This demonstration will set the path to commercialization for various applications, including but not limited to IoT. A strong added value is expected for microelectronics manufacturers, who can integrate PV cells together with MEMS sensors on the same chip, thus gaining size advantage. We will prepare a commercialization strategy and carry out IPR considerations in order to obtain strong IP position in this immensely growing market.",150000.0,150000.0,ERC-2018-PoC,ERC-POC,WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE,IL,,,

ABC COMPRESSORS has developed the Rotating Cylinder Compressor (CCR – Compresor Cilindros Rotativos) which adopts a disruptive concept of piston compression based in centrifugal forces. This new compressor concept enables to reduce up to 20% the energetic consumption of compressors eliminating the need of water cooling and reducing considerably the dimension (and constructive cost) of the compressor.

T’AIR ENERGIES is a French SME which aims at bringing to market an innovative energetic model where the local biomass and waste are valorised to produce and distribute green hydrogen for mobility (fuel cell electric cars), energy (electricity/gas) and industrial applications. 
Our innovative solution, called Hydrogreen, is a pyrogasification-based process where biomass (wood, wood waste, straw) is converted, with optimum efficiency, into energetic hydrogen and decarbonated CO2. Our methodology proposes an integral process based on the valorisation of locally available material and agricultural surpluses through a decentralized process that guarantees huge savings in terms of logistical costs (-66%) for the system's inputs. In addition, thanks to the optimization of the resources used and the introduction of waste/products at the end of their life in the productive cycle, it is fully aligned with the principles of the circular economy. Finally, the distribution of H2, in which the traditional service stations are complemented with a personalized system where our logistics partners directly transport the fuel to the end users, solves a key mobility bottleneck, further boosting the growth of the number of vehicles based on clean hydrogen energy.

Distributed storage can help better regulating the power grid and integrating more RE through self consumption and grid services. But few can afford it. Lancey aims at democratizing it by embarking a battery into a space heater. In France alone, 1/3 of real estate is electrically heated. Yet 1st generation electric heaters consume a lot of electricity and are highly responsible for the evening winter power peaks. Lancey has the solution to both of these issues. With its efficient heating technologies and energy management system, Lancey heater fine tunes to users’ needs while its battery charges off peak or with renewable energy surplus and discharges to prevent it from consuming power during peak hours.

As the capacity of data center servers is growing, so must the capacity of the links between those servers. Industry foresees a need for high volumes of 800Gb/s and 1.6Tb/s transceivers by 2025. 
Today, despite the use of complex Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), manufacturing an optical transceiver still requires a large number of sequential steps. This is because lasers and electronic chips need to be assembled on a piece-by-piece basis onto the PIC. The resulting optical engine then needs to be coupled to a fiber array and packaged. These steps are done sequentially, creating a bottleneck in the manufacturing line which makes it hard to scale up production and reduce cost. 
CALADAN will demonstrate how integration of lasers and electronics onto a PIC can be done fully at the wafer-level using the established micro transfer printing technique, thus eliminating this bottleneck. GaAs quantum dot lasers and 130nm SiGe BiCMOS 56Gbaud capable driver and receiver electronics will be transfer printed onto Silicon Photonic 300mm wafers.

An inexpensive process separates the main components of wood: cellulose and lignin. These can then be turned into final products such as bio-plastics, common chemicals and novel materials.
There are a variety of new value chains that are potentially created through our technology. For example, using the waste wood from a local council, cellulose can be isolated, which is hydrolysed, fermented to succinic acid and then used in paint. The lignin isolated alongside the cellulose can be turned into a drop-in biodiesel sold at the local petrol station. Similarly, sawdust from a timber mill can be fractionated, the cellulose used to produce methylcellulose as a thickener in food, the lignin turned into a bio-derived plastic.
We are diverting wood waste from going to landfill or incineration and sawdust going into pellets. The European pellets market is saturated, also with pellets imported from the Americas. The lignin and cellulose produced from these currently underused wood resources can enter new, emerging, or existing value chains.
Our competition on the waste wood disposal side is incineration, offering energy recovery in some cases but resulting in the formation of toxic ash and contributing to air pollution. For some heavily treated waste wood there are no competitors except for costly and highly undesirable landfilling which are largely viewed as problematic by both waste producers and waste managers.

Lead halide organic-inorganic perovskites manifest as excellent optoelectronic materials for this purpose, but at the expense of robustness and environmental compatibility. This presents a major challenge which this research addresses directly. Viable alternatives have to be identified. To tackle this challenge, MIX2FIX proposes to develop a new class of solution-processable optoelectronic devices based on air-stable, non-toxic metal chalcogenides endowed with an organic part, which will facilitate solution-processing and potentially enrich the compounds with the spectacular properties of halide perovskites. To achieve this, the CoG project has set the following objectives: (i) designing and developing optoelectronically-active, organic-inorganic chalcogenide thin films that have never been explored before, by mimicking strategies from established perovskite technology, (ii) devising means to improve their optoelectronic quality so as to be comparable with the best single-crystal semiconductors and (iii) implementing optimized materials into boundary-pushing PV and LED devices. Addressing these objectives will enable the development of novel functional hybrids at the boundaries of perovskite and chalcogenide thin films. With this, optoelectronics with efficiency and stability, comparable or higher than those of lead halide perovskite or chalcopyrite devices, will be demonstrated. This project will therefore permit the transition for emerging optoelectronic materials from toxic lead halide perovskites to green hybrid chalcogenides. Consolidating this unproven but disruptive technology will secure sustainable future for other areas of interest beyond photovoltaics, displays and lighting such as in X-Rays detectors and phototransistors or even beyond optoelectronics, in systems such as batteries and supercapacitors.",2731250.0,2731250.0,ERC-2018-COG,ERC-COG,ARISTOTELIO PANEPISTIMIO THESSALONIKIS,EL,,,

To sustain the growth of this industry, the replacement of fossil feedstocks with renewable carbon, phosphorus and silicon sources should be encouraged. Nonetheless, such a sourcing shift represents a paradigm shift: while the development of petrochemistry has relied on the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, the conversion of renewable feedstocks (e.g. CO2, phosphates, silicates or biomass) requires efficient reduction methods and catalysts to overcome their oxidized nature.
Today, no reduction method meets the criteria for a versatile and energy efficient reduction of oxidized feedstocks and the aim of the ReNewHydrides project is to design novel reductants and catalytic reactions to achieve this important aim. At the crossroads of main group element chemistry, organometallic chemistry, electrochemistry and homogenous catalysis, I propose to develop innovative and recyclable reductants based on silicon and boron compounds, and to utilize them to tackle catalytic challenges in the reduction of C–O,  P–O and Si–O bonds. The overarching principle is to build a balanced synthetic cycle, where the electrochemical reduction of functionalized and oxidized substrates is ensured by silicon and boron based hydride donors, with a high energy efficiency and selectivity.
This project will foster innovative routes in the utilization of renewable carbon, phosphorus and silicon feedstocks. It is therefore of high risk, but ultimately extremely rewarding.

The overarching goal of this project is to draw together a broad, effective and inclusive network of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) – hereafter referred to as CCUS – stakeholders to support the development of zero emission fossil fuel power plants and energy intensive industries. 

Supporting the coordination of diverse stakeholders - including the private and public sectors - will contribute to a common agreement on the role that CCUS technologies can play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 

This proposal will support the coordination of the stakeholders’ activities through the SET-Plan CCUS European Technology Innovation Platform (ETIP). A key activity of the ETIP will be to support progress of the CCUS Research and Innovation (R&I) activities contained in the SET-Plan CCS and CCU Implementation Plan . The Implementation Plan was developed by a temporary working group and adopted by the Set Plan Steering Group on 27th September 2017. The Implementation Plan R&I activities will support delivery of the SET-Plan targets agreed for Action 9 on CCS and CCU.           

This proposal is to continue the ETIP ZEP activities supported through the project SESZEP funded under LCE-36-2016. The grant for this project ends on the 30th of April 2018 and so there will be a gap in the support to the ETIP stakeholders.

These MNDs include the devastating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A fascinating question in neurodegeneration research is why mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes result in the selective death of a specific neuronal subtype. The ubiquitously expressed and conserved survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein receives its name because its deficit results in MN degeneration. However, SMN known functions -spliceosome assembly and axonal mRNA transport- do not explain the selective MN vulnerability. 
Accumulation of intracellular aggregates in neurons is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. The lysosome-autophagy system is the main catabolic pathway for recycling of protein aggregates and damaged organelles, and its role as a quality control system is especially critical in neurons, due to their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. The hypothesis for this proposal is that SMN deficiency leads to a lysosome-autophagy dysfunction which results in a proteostatic failure, underlying MN degeneration. Furthermore, the existing heterogeneity in SMN protein levels across MN populations may determine their probability of survival. 
To test these hypotheses we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically engineer human control, SMA and ALS patient-derived iPSCs to generate isogenic and reporter lines that will allow us to study selective neuronal subtypes at a single-cell level. We will also follow an interdisciplinary approach using a SMA Drosophila model to identify new molecular pathways essential for SMN neuropathology. Altogether, my research proposal aims at untangling the molecular mechanisms underlying selective MN death. Our results will open up new directions of research into the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and will provide clues for the design of therapeutics targeting specific neuronal types or phases of MNDs.",1472667.34,1472667.34,ERC-2018-STG,ERC-STG,DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUR NEURODEGENERATIVE ERKRANKUNGEN EV,DE,AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DEINVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS,ES,

Mastering multi-electron reactions such as the OER is critical for the transition from dwindling fossil fuels to ecologically and economically sustainable fuels based on renewable energy. Water is the most abundant source of hydrogen bonds on earth and fuels based on these bonds have the highest energy densities, which makes water an attractive resource for sustainable fuels production. However, the production of any hydrogen-based fuel from water is currently thwarted by the low efficiency of the OER. Improved catalysts are presently designed by optimizing a single step in the reaction sequence. In contrast, I target the low efficiency of the OER by engineering multiple steps of the mechanism to (i) control the number of electron transfers before the limiting step; and (ii) enforce a reaction path close to the thermodynamic limit. Combining these two strategies increases the catalytic current of transition metal oxides at typical overpotentials by a factor of 100,000. Rational design of the mechanism on this fundamental level calls for unprecedented insight into the active state of electrocatalysts. My team will achieve this firstly by novel approaches to prepare catalytically limiting states for their elucidation by synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy and secondly by studying transitions between these states in pioneering time-resolved experiments.

Thermoacoustic instabilities are large-amplitude pressure oscillations caused by an escalating interaction between the flame and acoustic waves; they tend to occur unexpectedly and cause major hardware damage. Flashback is the dangerous phenomenon of the flame propagating backwards into components not designed for high temperatures. The ultimate vision of POLKA is to create new physical insight and advanced simulation tools, so as to underpin the development of hydrogen-fuelled combustion systems (gas turbines, aero-engines, boilers furnaces, etc). The methods to be used are a combination of experiments, numerical simulations and analytical techniques. Experimental validation of numerical and analytical results is a high priority.

However, Europe has numerous historic buildings, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment in order to fulfil the requirements of sustainability and use.
When responsible bodies do spend money anyway, it seems logical and ecologically worthwhile to apply “soft” maintenance procedures, which save costs and also reduce energy consumption of historic buildings. Integrating these buildings into national climate change and energy policies seems therefore quite necessary and a challenge, as far as appropriate techniques and procedures are concerned, which can only be met through excellently trained craftsmen and apprentices of the crafts concerned.

• to protect traditional competences and skills for built Cultural Heritage relevant for energy efficiency and renewable energy
• the need to involve adequately educated and trained professionals and craftsmen in “soft” conservation, maintenance and ongoing care

We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. 

The Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis. By inducing excited states in solid catalysts to work in synergy with the excited short-lived plasma species, we introduce a brand new idea for catalyst-plasma symbiosis. In addition, we introduce a fully new concept of nano-/micro-plasma array through a novel electrode design, to generate the plasma at the catalyst surface, thereby overcoming long distance transport. By embedding ferro-magnetic nano-domains in the catalyst support and inducing radiofrequency heating, we create fast temperature modulations directly at the catalyst active sites. Combining these elements, the project will overcome the actual limits and enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency to levels suitable for exploitation. This requires a synergy over different scale elements: nano at catalyst, micro at the level of modelling plasma generated species, milli at the reactor scale and mega at the plant level for sustainability-driven opportunity guidance and impact assessment by Life-Cycle-Assessment.

PAIDEIA focuses on two main advantages aiming to enhance the capacity of solar energy conversion: 
i) plasmon assisted hot carriers extraction from NIR plasmonic materials;
ii) linewidth narrowing in plasmonic nanoparticle films that enhances the lifetime of hot carriers and, thus, boosts the efficiency of light driven carrier extraction.
Instead of metals, which operate mostly in the visible region, we will make use of doped semiconductor nanocrystals (DSNCs) as hot electron extraction materials possessing a plasmonic response tunable in the range 800 nm – 4000 nm.

The integration of more renewable energy into the grid, creating highly variable, unpredictable and distributed energy production, uneven load and peak demand and transmission losses create significant challenges for utilities to effectively guarantee energy supply. 
Despite the investing billions of euros in Smart Meters, it is clear they are not the solution. They only collect limited amounts of data for the utility, do not give households greater control of their energy use, and cannot implement demand side management. 

Solution – Bl!xt DigiBreaker
DigiBreaker turns your fuse box into a smartphone, collecting and communicating rich, real time electricity usage data as it passes through the circuit breaker. All the time while maintaining the core function of a circuit breaker, which is to interrupt current flow when there is a fault in the system. DigiBreaker breaks 1000 times faster and is more secure than the mechanical devices.
DigiBreaker offers the following functionality:
•	Enables remote demand side management for the utility.
•	Direct two-way communication between the utility and the household.
•	An integrated controller that measures and collects detailed energy usage. 
•	Can be controlled remotely via smart phone or computer. 

Project
The aim of the phase 1 project is to improve our understanding of the value DigiBreaker holds for our target customer and clearly map out the route to market. In phase 2 we envisage to scale up the technology, establish a strategy for compliance in Europe, run pilots with utilities and build a commercial and operational strategic plan to demonstrate these aspects to utilities on a large scale. 

Impact & Market

An Environmental History of Coastal Dunes",2018-11-01,2023-10-31,,"Dunes are now protected environments, being top priority for coastal managers, because of their important role as coastal defences. But, it was not like that in the past.
For centuries dunes were considered unproductive and dangerous. The sand blown by the wind was taken inland, invading fields, silting rivers and destroying villages. In the eighteenth century, a strategy was developed to fight against the dunes: trapping them with trees, with the double purpose of preventing the destruction of arable land and increasing their economic value converting them into forest areas. Different governments, in different countries supported the immobilization of the shifting sands. The strategy, developed in Europe, was taken to other places in the world. These works caused profound changes in vast coastal areas transforming arid landscapes of sandy dunes into green tree forests. 
This project aims to explore human-environment relations in coastal areas worldwide, since the eighteenth century until today, through the study of dunes as hybrid landscapes. Based on selected case-studies and comparative approaches, the project will focus on the origins, reasons and means of dunes afforestation; the impacts of the creation of new landscapes to local communities and ecosystems; and the present situation of dunes as coastal defences and rehabilitated environments. The final purpose is to produce an innovative global history of coastal dunes, combining knowledges from both Humanities and Social Sciences and Physical and Life Sciences, which has never been done.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team, this research will result in new developments in the field of the Environmental History studies; provide relevant knowledge considering the need of efficient management solutions to adapt to the expected mean sea level rise; and stimulate environmental citizenship by disseminating the idea that the future of the world coasts depends on today’s actions.",1062330.0,1062330.0,ERC-2018-STG,ERC-STG,Faculdade de letras da Universidade de Lisboa,PT,,,

With increasing penetration of renewable energy resources (RES), and high expectations from end-users for energy reliability, connectivity and utilisation of available energy resources needs reconsideration. Thus, technologically smart and economically viable solutions for extending the lifetime of energy infrastructure will be in high demand. Incorporating more distributed RES and storage assets at the edges of the electricity grid, and optimally balancing these assets with other energy vectors, while extending the lifetime of current infrastructures will not only be economically viable, but at the same time decrease the level of carbonisation in local energy systems.

These materials are key in transport systems, wind power and H storage. Despite the enormous economic significance, little is known fundamentally about the underlying damage mechanisms, which are inherently playing out on the atomic scale.

The PI’s team will use atom probe tomography, an atomic scale 3D microscopy method to systematically analyse the location and pathways of H in the microstructure and shed light on damage mechanisms in Fe and Ni based materials. This will include vacancies/clusters (0D), dislocations (1D), interfaces (2D) and second phased (3D). The approach will be combined with micro-mechanics to investigate the involvement of H in fracture behaviour. We will measure the amount of H at dislocations required for enhanced plasticity, in the plastic wake of a crack and at the crack tip. In production materials, we will determine the amount of H at identified traps after processing as well as penetration pathways into the material. Finally, we will clarify the contribution of H to a important problem for wind power generation: white-etching cracks.

These experiments are now made possible in a commercial atom probe by using 2H (D) charging combined with cryo specimen transfers to avoid H loss. In the project, the team will go a step further and build an atom probe with ultra-low H background to enable the direct detection of 1H, enabling analysis without tracers.

The resulting knowledge will greatly enhance our knowledge on the fundamentals of H in metals at the atomic scale. This will lead to increased predictability of failures, the rational design of H resistant high strength materials and protection measures and with it great cost savings especially in renewable energy generation and electromobility.",1497959.0,1497959.0,ERC-2018-STG,ERC-STG,FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITAET ERLANGEN NUERNBERG,DE,,,

Of these, the most ecoefficient bioplastic is PLA as it is biodegradable, requires 50% less energy and produces 10 times less emissions in comparison to standard thermoplastics like PET and PP. Furthermore, as it does not need to be recycled, it not only saves the energy and cost involved, but also the fact that only a fraction of the plastic produced reaches the recycling plant, the rest ending up in landfill or the sea.
However, biodegradable plastics only make up approximately 0.2% of plastics produced in 2014. This is because conventional PLA has certain technical limitations which reduce the number of marketable applications where it can be used. For example, it cannot compete with standard thermoplastic grades used in packaging applications (such as PET and PE), in terms of oxygen and water vapour barrier and thermal properties, which are the most demanded properties for packaging requirements. 
Advanced & Functional Technologies for Biocomposites S.L (ADBIOCOMPOSITES) has developed an innovative, biodegradable PLA grade named BlockPLA which has enhanced technical properties: oxygen and water vapour barrier, thermal stability, transparency and flexibility. BlockPLA solves the drawbacks that PLA currently shows for packaging applications. In addition, BlockPLA has food contact approval and requires less energy to be produced. Production costs are slightly lower than conventional PLA.

Increasing population, urbanization and industrialization are accelerating drastically the generation of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Landfilling is the usual method but is the least recommended option since they release GHG, contaminates the soil and ground water, produces unpleasant odours and spread pathogenic microorganisms. Recycling is unable to deal with the huge amount of garbage produced. Mass-burn incineration eliminates waste but emits highly dangerous dioxins and furans creating major social opposition. Composting is limited to large fractions of organic waste and is very odorous. Most of the gasification plants that started to operate have shut down failing to provide a solution to the problem. New clean and cost-efficient technologies to dispose this huge amount of garbage are urgently needed. PYROCRACK uses a patented Pyrolysis process to treat MSW obtaining a mixture of liquids, gases and solids with high energy content and a novel Thermal Cracking process that improves the quality of this mixture. Pyrolysis decomposes waste without using O2 which avoids pollutant emissions. Thanks to its endothermic feature it transforms waste into high value products that can be commercialised in the industry making of PYROCRACK a flagship of the Circular Economy. Pyrolysis has been known for centuries but now it is the focus of the MSW treatment business because of the inability of the existing techniques to respond to the ever-growing generation of garbage. Our approach is disruptive since we will treat MSW in a distributed manner through profitable and clean small/medium plants located closer to households and businesses to transform the content of waste into usable products (biochar, syngas and power).

In the absence of further actions to those already planned by water companies to balance supply and demand, under a high population and high climate change scenario, UK water supply deficits are projected to become more widespread by the 2050s. In particular: • The north west of England and the Yorkshire and Humber region are projected to be highly susceptible to supply-demand deficits, as well as London and the south-east. However, deficits are projected in other parts of the UK as well, including areas of south Wales and the central belt of Scotland. • At a national scale, England, Scotland and Wales are projected to be in deficit by 800 million to 3 billion litres per day by 2050 (5–16% of total demand) and by 1.4 billion to 5 billion litres per day by 2080 (8-29% of the total demand).

However, ruminants can convert biomass unsuitable for direct human consumption (e.g. grass resources) into valuable food, including essential macro and micro-nutrients for humans. While grazing, ruminants contribute to: maintaining the landscape and, in specific local conditions, to; enhancing biodiversity and increasing carbon sequestration.

The contemporary industry challenge is therefore to develop livestock production systems that simultaneously enhance environmental sustainability and support a healthy diet.

These energy sources cause voltage instabilities in the power grid as they inject uncontrolled power in various locations along the power grid. This instability issue is the main obstacle that holds back further penetration of renewable energy in to the power grid.
Existing methods of real time voltage control in the distribution network are both expensive and have relatively low performance and include replacing already installed distribution transformers with newer transformers. 
We suggest the application of an add-on unit that enhances existing and already-installed distribution transformers, for real-time voltage control with similar efficiency, cost and reliability as conventional transformer. The application of a large number of real time voltage controlled transformers in the power grid will result in reduced losses in the power grid and increased stability in face of distributed generation. Moreover, it will allow for adoption of a much higher percentage of renewables.
The market for real time voltage controlled transformers has grown from zero in 2011 to 1B$ in 2017 and is expected to grow at almost 20% annually in the next 30 years. (“Global Smart Transformer Market (2016-2022),” Business Wire report, Sep 2016).

To grow 1 tonne of mushroom, 3 to 4 tonnes of substrate are needed. However, when mushroom production is completed the substrate cannot be used for another growing cycle due to the depletion of nutrients needed for mushroom growing and it is called Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS) and becomes a waste that should be managed according to regulations. In Europe, c.a. 3.65 million tons of SMS are generated each year. SMS is a high-moisture content bulk material rich in organic matter and nutrients and it could be reused in agriculture by adding it to the soils as amendment or mulch or weathered to be reused as casing soil. However, nitrates directive set a disposal limit that makes that large quantities of SMS cannot be simply spread in soils next to growers’ facilities, as there is a high risk of leachates and water pollution. Due to its low bulk density and high water content, transportation costs are high and therefore storage is becoming a sound problem. SmartMUSHROOM aims to increase mushroom growers’ waste management efficiency by using a new technology which allow them to obtain enough biogas from fresh SMS to dry a mixture of digestate and additional fresh SMS and pelletize it targeting to obtain a marketable high-quality organic fertilizer rich in organic matter and in nutrients, easy to handle, store and transport to any farming region in Europe.

By 2050, the EU-28 aims to achieve CO2 emissions cuts of 80-95% compared to 1990 levels and to achieve a 20% share
for renewable energy sources in its overall energy consumption by 2020. This requires a process of 'decarbonising'
Europe's economy, including the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. Wind energy and Solar
photovoltaic (PV) energy have been the leading sources of low carbon electricity generation in EU since 2011.
The installation of wind turbines is characterized by very high construction costs that amortize slowly over the years through
the sale of electricity to the grid. The amount of energy produced depends mainly on the nominal power of the installed
generator and of the amount of wind that can be used.
INNOWIND offers cost-effective mid-power wind turbine farms, with high flexibility in terms of size and area of construction,
with low security requirements and no special construction permits required, making implementation in urban areas a
possibility. INNOWIND offers for the first time the opportunity to make use of terrain not suitable for conventional wind
farming.
Furthermore, thanks to the easy scaling of the units from 50kW to 1000kW, it is possible to cater the specific power needs in
a wider range of use-cases and scenarios. Other unique selling points include less visual and environmental impacts, safer

Anaerobic digesters treat high COD wastewater and produce biogas used as a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, even the most advanced high-rate systems present important technical and economic limitations: 1) Post-treatment (usually aerobic) is still required for wastewater discharge on surface water (COD elimination rates are in the range of 60-80% for current technologies), 2) Digester investment costs are high (€300,000 for the smallest reactors), 3) The efficiency of biogas production is low (35-50%).

Renol, a biodegradable biopolymer with strong material properties, represents an alternative to many plastics, such as polystyrene (PS), which are associated with serious environmental and health issues.

Growing concerns regarding the problem of plastic in our oceans is leading to legislation banning certain plastics and driving demand from brand owners for replacement products. Starch based bioplastics, already available in the market, are limited in terms of applications as they are not water resistant. Renol, in contrast, can be used in a wide range of applications and in fact offers superior material qualities to some fossil-based polymers (e.g. mechanical strength, UV stability and fire-resistance). It is suitable for use in products which must be durable while in use, but, unlike most plastic, it will degrade (in a compostable environment) when no longer needed.

Kraft lignin is a waste product of kraft pulping (widely used for the manufacture of pulp and paper). RenFuel's solution offers to add value to lignin waste - thus representing a circular solution to the plastics pollution problem.  Lignin raw material is widely available in the pulp industry, in sufficient volumes to hypothetically replace a significant percentage of the fossil fuels used in the global plastics market.

RenFuel's business model involves the sale of Renol in pellet form to compounders, for mixing with existing (fossil-based) polymers to manufacture an end plastic product with a percentage of biodegrability - and potentially also add other valuable properties.

The overall objective is to engineer bio-inspired systems able to convert solar energy into a separation of charges and to construct devices by coupling these systems to catalysts in order to drive sustainable and effective water oxidation and hydrogen production.

The global energy crisis requires an urgent solution, we must replace fossil fuels for a renewable energy source: Solar energy. However, the efficient and inexpensive conversion and storage of solar energy into fuel remains a fundamental challenge. Currently, solar-energy conversion devices suffer from energy losses mainly caused by disorder in the materials used. The solution to this problem is to learn from nature. In photosynthesis, the photosystem II reaction centre (PSII RC) is a pigment-protein complex able to overcome disorder and convert solar photons into a separation of charges with near 100% efficiency. Crucially, the generated charges have enough potential to drive water oxidation and hydrogen production. 

Previously, I have investigated the charge separation process in the PSII RC by a collection of spectroscopic techniques, which allowed me to formulate the design principles of photosynthetic charge separation, where coherence plays a crucial role. Here I will put these knowledge into action to design efficient and robust chromophore-protein assemblies for the collection and conversion of solar energy, employ organic chemistry and synthetic biology tools to construct these well defined and fully controllable assemblies, and apply a complete set of spectroscopic methods to investigate these engineered systems. 

Following the approach Understand, Engineer, Implement, I will create a new generation of bio-inspired devices based on abundant and biodegradable materials that will drive the transformation of solar energy and water into hydrogen, an energy-rich molecule that can be stored and transported.",1500000.0,1500000.0,ERC-2018-STG,ERC-STG,FUNDACIO PRIVADA INSTITUT CATALA D'INVESTIGACIO QUIMICA,ES,,,

The current Water Framework Directive has strict regulations on a wide range of contaminants, and most treatments continuously increase the energy demand of the water cycle. Yet, the EU is committed to ambitious targets to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions, including the legally binding 2015 Paris agreement. 
These conflicting interests have motivated REWATERGY, a partnership within the water-energy nexus. This integrated network, led by industry in partnership with world leading academic institutions, envisions the scientific and technological opportunities of such challenges with direct economic and social impacts to the EU. Three research objectives set the foundation of this ambitious programme, 
i) enhance the energy recovery from waste water streams inspired by the circular economy concept,
ii) improve the energy efficiency of water disinfection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern, and 
iii) increase the resilience of distributed household safe drinking water systems addressing potential health and safety challenges. 
The programme is particularly designed to cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit by the collaborative design, development and manufacturing of new prototypes aligned with the three research objectives.

Although PMMA can be turned back into its monomer, the technology has limited applications. Currently what is collected and reprocessed are mostly production scraps, which is about 10 % of the annual PMMA production but a much larger amount of recyclable product is available. On a world scale basis, 10 % of post-industrial scraps and the equivalent of 10 % of post-consumer products represent a potential of a Billion € market. The MMAtwo project main objective is to construct a novel and fast growing PMMA recycling value chain through depolymerization and recovery of a monomer grade sold at 90 % of virgin MMA price. MMAtwo targets to reduce the energy needs by more than 70 % and the CO2 emissions by more than 60 %. To achieve its objective, MMAtwo integrates representative players along the value chain. During the project, PMMA will be collected from production scraps, but also from End-of-Life vehicles, Electronics goods, construction…. The lead-free depolymerization process will be validated at TRL7 enabling the possibility of a first commercial unit soon after the end of the project. A versatile purification process will be validated through repolymerization of the produced monomer. MMA grades produced will be validated in several optical and non-optical applications. The inorganic fractions from PMMA composites will also be valorized. The project will establish standards for post-consumer and post-production PMMA based products in order to facilitate the recycling. Training and education activities will be organized in order to prepare the next generation of Engineers and Researchers in the field of closed-loop polymer recycling.

The product developed by Intenanomat is a transparent conductive polymer which can be easily coated on a thin layer over different surfaces. OHMIO is a transparent conductive layer used as an HTM (hole transport material) for TFPV. OHMIO is the only HTM that is flexible enough to fit TFPV cells, achieving higher efficiencies because of their higher layer transparency in the IR range, reducing production costs and avoiding the use of corona treatment or similar.
OHMIO will solve main current problems related to HTM: water severely damage the organic material layers (OHMIO is formulated without water), strong acid compositions reduce the TFPV shelf life (OHMIO is formulated in a liquid with selected additives and solvents) and high manufacturing costs (OHMIO will reduce the production process costs of an electronic device by up to 80%. OHMIO will involve savings of up to 200% in raw materials and several reductions of the carbon footprint. Additionally, OHMIO is easy to scale-up due to its manufacturing process does not need additional investment if the application changes.

The platform consists of an autonomous software-hardware solution, implementing an Object Oriented Real-Time Decision Tree learning algorithm for smart monitoring and diagnostics of structural and mechanical WT components. The innovative concept lies in running WT telemetry data through a machine learning based decision tree classification algorithm in real-time for detecting faults, errors, damage patterns, anomalies and abnormal operation. We believe our innovation creates evident value and will raise great interest as decision-support tool for WT manufacturers, Wind Farm Operators, Service Companies and Insurers.

The same year, 53 million tons of waste PET is landfilled, incinerated or floats into seas and oceans. 
Gr3n proposes a completely new way to break this vicious circle and create plastic from waste.
The problem with PET is that it is currently “reused” and not “recycled”, as only transparent and pale bottles are mechanically treated to be partly added to virgin PET in the production of plastic bottles and trays. All other PET derived products, as waste polyester textiles and coloured plastics are almost worthless to the market and end up polluting the environment.
Our vision is to enable the first truly circular approach to PET recycling, empowered by our patented technology able to break any kind of PET into its two main building blocks, for creating new PET plastics infinitely and cost-effectively.
Through a 15,000 tons/year gr3n plant we do expect to collect, process and address the need of virgin plastics and polyester of a metropolitan area, thus triggering a true circular approach to plastic recycling. The cPET project is focused on validating the sustainability of creating a European distributed network of gr3n plants localized in each urban area, able to treat any PET-derived waste and produce new plastic for local consumption.

As recognised by the European Commission, island energy is expensive, polluting, inefficient and dependent on external supply, with significant negative impacts on emissions, the competitiveness of businesses, and the economy. 

Assuming that just 65% of these islands’ electricity comes from diesel, we estimate that they produce approximately 17.5 million tonnes of CO2 every year. This is further increased when considering isolated coastal communities. Existing renewable alternatives are often unsuitable for these communities, such as wind and solar power, as the energy they generate is unpredictable and intermittent, making it difficult to rely on. They also have a large land footprint and high CAPEX costs. Tidal energy is also often unsuitable, as it requires fast tidal flows (over 2.5m/s) which only occur in a few specific hot spots around the World. The technology is also expensive, with both high CAPEX and OPEX costs. 

The Deep Green Island Mode (DG Island Mode) is a stand-alone tidal and ocean current energy converter for off-grid applications. The DG Island Mode is the concept of flying an underwater kite, that when steered in an 8-shaped trajectory, generates a speed of 8-10 times the speed of the actual current. This generates the following unique performance characteristics: 
- Generates cost effective electricity in tidal flows as low as 1.3 m/s 
- Generates up to 100kW, producing an estimated 0.35 GWh/year, enough to power 100 homes; 
- Can be located close to the shore; 
- Up to 15 times lighter per kW compared to other tidal energy solutions - Easy, low cost installation and maintenance (low CAPEX and OPEX costs); 
- Cost of energy 50% lower than diesel generators DG Island Mode offers cheap, clean, reliable electricity generation to island communities.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,MINESTO AB,SE,,,

Electricity consumers are progressively turning into prosumers (producers & consumers) who decide at a given moment whether to buy electricity from the grid, to self-consume or even to export it to the grid. Moreover, European energy regulations require EU consumers to commit to clean and energy efficient objectives. For instance, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy (NZEB) by the end of 2020 by reducing energy consumption and using renewable sources and all new public buildings to be NZEB by 2018. The most extended renewable energy in the world is wind power. However, wind power is not very common in urban areas where high speed laminar wind turns into a low speed turbulent one due to the existence of obstacles (buildings, houses, trees, structures, etc.). Traditional wind power turbines are not designed to work with low speed wind (2 m/s – 6m/s) and turbulent wind flows. Besides, traditional SWTs entail other serious problems such as the hazard of rotating machinery, vibrations, noise, the possibility of collapse atop buildings, blade shedding and visual impact. EOLI FPS is a patented rooftop vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) specifically designed to work under low speed and turbulent wind profiles such as the existing in urban environments. EOLIS FPS works perfectly with horizontal laminar wind but also take advantage of turbulent flows that adversely affect traditional wind turbines. Its internal rotor design facilitates the creation of vortexes out of the wind turbulence that drastically increases the driving force of the laminar wind.

To reach this goal new waste management strategies need to be applied by municipalities, not only to align with EU recycling targets but also to be able to cover increasing disposal costs. Strategies should begin by making households aware of the necessity to lower their waste generation, while increasing their recycling rate. One of the most effective ways to motivate households, is through 'Pay as you throw' (PAYT) schemes, based on the implementation of a disposal fee per household, according to the amount of waste generated. In order to be able to apply PAYT schemes, selective waste collection needs to be implemented by municipalities or waste management companies. One of the most common, is door-to-door (DtD) waste collection, as it greatly facilitates the application of PAYT schemes while promoting recycling among households. Even though, the combination of DtD collection with PAYT greatly reduces the load of waste generated, current systems to account for the amounf of waste generated per household are not accurate. They quantify based on the number of bags/bins (with a set volume) each household generates, without considering that in many occasions these bags/bins are just partially filled upon collection. Nevertheless, households are charged the same, neglecting if all the volume has been filled. A new accurate measuring system is needed. We are Distromel, a spanish company specialized in the develoment of technological solutions for the waste management market. Aiming to solve an increasing concurrent demand from private and public WM companies, we have created SmartDtD: a certified weighing and identification system (RFID number) integrated in a container that can be embedded in any truck (under EN-840).SmartDtD is a technological solution specially designed for door-to-door waste collection that will help optimize waste collection services as well as PAYT programs.'",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,DISTROMEL SA,ES,,,

These keys work with encryption algorithms and are crucial to ensuring data security. However, most commonly used RNGs do not generate truly random numbers, so encrypted data and communications are increasingly vulnerable to hackers. The most secure solution for ciphers is the use of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs). These use quantum physics principles for true randomness.
There are a number of barriers for QRNGs to be used in the market. Some existing QRNGs are too slow (i.e. only Mbps), some are not high-quality and all of them are too expensive. Also, QRNGs are 100mm2 or more, too large for many applications.
Quside will overcome these barriers with a QRNG chip called Qupic. It uses standard components and manufacturing procedures. It is high-quality and lightning-fast (up to tens of Gbps). The Qupic chip is so small that it can fit inside of a smartphone and so fast that it satisfies the needs of a data centre. Our manufacturing processes allow us to build this technology not just faster and smaller than our competitors, but also orders of magnitude cheaper. 
The result will be a permanently secure infrastructure for data and communications.
The QRNG market size will approach $1 billion by 2020. Apart from security in servers, the cloud and connected devices, QRNGs are also used for complex simulations in scientific, financial and engineering applications. Our initial target markets will be: data centre security, random numbers as a service, IoT devices, large-scale numerical simulations and smartphones/laptops/tablets.
Quside is a technology start-up spun out from ICFO–The Institute of Photonic Sciences in 2017, developing quantum and photonic technologies using a fabless business model.

High value products are materials that may be used as carbon based chemical feedstocks and as synthetic fuels, reducing the ever-present demand on oil and natural gas to fulfil these needs. The project is within the remit of an international ambition to valorise carbon dioxide waste and reduce environmentally harmful greenhouse gas generation, as opposed to stopping at carbon capture and sequestration. This proposal outlines an alternative route to carbon dioxide utilisation (CDU), in which a mediated approach that decouples the electrochemical reduction from the catalytic process is explored. Novel bimetallic catalysts will be synthesised and studied, meditating electron donating solutions will be generated, and a robust and comprehensive analytical arrangement will be implemented to allow total identification and quantification of the wide range of possible products. 
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the key approaches to CDU, as it has a direct pathway to carbon neutral renewable electricity. Nonetheless it is a field that has shown minimal progress in the past 30 years. A paradigm shift is necessary in the approach to electrochemical CO2 reduction, where conventional heterogeneous interfacial catalysis is limited by mass transport, passivation, and CO2 solubility. This proposal outlines the use of electron donating mediators generated separately to the catalysed chemical reduction of CO2, such that the electrolyte becomes the electrode. This opens a whole new avenue for catalyst research, and here target bimetallic catalysts that suppress side reactions and promote high value product synthesis are described.",1499994.0,1499994.0,ERC-2018-STG,ERC-STG,UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER,UK,,,

Annual e-bike sales are in the order of 3,400 M€ in Europe only and are expected to rise up to 7, 200 M€ by 2025. However, there is still an unsolved and recurrent complaint related to the limited autonomy of e-bikes. 
LONGRIDER is a novel control system for e-bikes that provides extended battery autonomy by supporting the cyclist only when necessary and by applying extensive and efficient regenerative braking. By cleverly controlling the energy use (deliver and recover), the feeling for the cyclist is that of continuously riding on flat terrain irrespective of the terrain slope, and in the limit case it is even possible to make the battery last close-to-indefinitely (provided that the user is willing to compensate the system inefficiencies by pedaling). Thus, the value proposition of the LONGRIDER e-bike can be formulated in 2 ways:
-An e-bike with the same battery size as competitors that can last significantly more (up to 200% more with mild regenerative braking, and above that with a more intensive regeneration set-up)
-An e-bike with a smaller battery size than competitors for the same autonomy (LONGRIDER requires a battery-pack 60-70% smaller with the associated cost and weight reduction)
The development of this new concept is being carried out by a team that has extensive experience in the electric mobility industry developing next generation motors for electric vehicles, as well as a solid background in bicycles with over 10 patents related to innovative concepts for bicycles, some of them under licensing discussions with major brands in the bicycle industry (Sram, Campagnolo and FSA).

This phenomenon is outpacing the industry’s capacity for drug discovery and development. Antimicrobial resistance is costing the EU today €1.5 billion and 25,000 deaths annually. Developing de novo classical drugs is very costly and time consuming, and for every new drug released a resistant strain has rapidly emerged. This paradigm is hindering our ability to respond to outbreaks. Among causative organisms, viruses pose a major threat, being responsible for the outbreaks impacting the world in the past decade (SARS, Influenza A, MERS, etc). Although some antivirals have been developed for them, they lose their efficacy rapidly due to the high mutation rate of viruses, which alters the antigenic features originally used to develop the drug. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel discovery methods that allow to accelerate the development of broad-spectrum and mutability-independent antimicrobials. In response, Signia Therapeutics has developed and validated a drug discovery platform for fast identification of compounds with antimicrobial activity. Instead of selecting drugs that target pathogen determinants, it selects drugs that target determinants of the infected cell. This method offers key advantages: i) avoids the impact of microbe intrinsic mutability; ii) broad spectrum drugs can be identified. Since the platform seeks for antimicrobial applications among drugs already commercialized (repurposing) and among pharma libraries (recycling), drug discovery becomes faster, safer and cost-efficient. Having reached the functional stage (TRL6), this project encloses the roadmap to finalise the platform’s development and its preparation for market. Once completed, this project will have huge impacts for society (better management of infections and preparedness against outbreaks), and for our company (expected ROI of €2.1 from this project after 5 years).",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,SIGNIA THERAPEUTICS,FR,,,

In 2016, Wind Power installed more than any other form of power generation in Europe (51% of total power capacity installations), overtaking coal as the 2nd largest form of power generation capacity.
Since cost reduction of each kW/h generated by Wind Power industry is one of its strategic targets, the market displays a strong tendency towards bigger wind turbines with longer blades. However, bigger rotor diameters have raised a dramatic problem regarding the durability of the blades which concerns the whole value chain of the wind power industry. Increasing blade lengths means faster linear velocity of the tip of the blade and consequently higher erosion rate of the leading edge of the blade caused by rain, hail or suspended particles.
Although the lifespan of a wind turbine is calculated in 25 years, traditional medium sized wind turbines provided with current protection systems of the leading edges, required complete maintenance tasks due to deterioration of the blades at around year 10. However, recently installed turbines with \100 m diameter rotors showed problems regarding the erosion of the blades at year 2.
In order to solve the erosion problem, Aerox Advanced Polymers SL, a SME specialised in developing solutions for the wind power industry, has developed an innovative leading edge protection (LEP) polymeric coating with particular mechanical and chemical properties which is able to avoid the erosion problem during the whole lifetime of the wind blade.
The LEP4BLADES project aims to accelerate the commercialisation of the coating solution through the scaling-up the manufacturing and application processes, which will also require the improvement of the polymer technology and the product formulation.",1445175.0,1011622.5,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-2,SME-2,AEROX ADVANCED POLYMERS SL,ES,,,

These tracers travel along underground reservoirs and fractures and enable operators to map subsurface water and oil flows. With our tracers, we mimic nature’s craftiness to store information. We can deliver billions of unique DNA tracer combinations with a detection limit that is thousands of times less than for currently used tracers, at a 50% cost reduction of an average tracer job.
Given that in underground environments, information is key to trigger millionaire investments, our DNA tracers represent a strategic value for the exploration and production of oil and geothermal energy industries, with potential benefits for our customers in the million euros range.

Moreover, we contribute to the sustainability of the energy mix. The understanding of underground flows enables more sustainable oil extraction avoiding additional wells and, makes renewable geothermal energy production feasible in locations other than limited volcanic areas.

iCAREPLAST addresses the cost and energy-efficient recycling of a large fraction of today’s non-recyclable plastics and composites from urban waste. Heterogeneous plastic mixtures will be converted into valuable chemicals (alkylaromatic) via chemical routes comprising sequential catalytic and separation steps. This multistage process will also yield carbon char and a pure CO2 stream as products, whilst it will present improved economic sustainability, operational flexibility and lower CO2 footprint thanks to (i) the energetic valorisation of gas by-products through innovative oxycombustion units integrated with efficient heat recovery; and (ii) the use of AI predictive control and real time optimisation. iCAREPLAST aims to demonstrate (TRL-7) the whole technology for plastic waste valorisation in a pilot plant able to process >100 kg/h of plastic. Advanced upstream waste sorting, pre-treatment and pyrolysis is strongly backed by previous demonstration activities and knowhow of the consortium, with profound knowledge of waste management and recycling market.

Customers such as Audi, Daimler and Volvo have set a target 10% weight and cost reduction for CNG tanks, to increase efficiency and reduce vehicle cost. 

Most CNG tanks are made from a metal or polymer liner, over-wound with a carbon/epoxy composite, but:

•	Wet-winding of carbon/epoxy is slow, so limits cost-effective production
•	Their properties vary by up to 10%, so excess material is used to compensate 

To meet the customer targets, Plastic Omnium has developed a new process for the fast, efficient production of CNG tanks, using 8-axis robotic tape placement cell from MF Tech, and high quality carbon/polyamide tape developed by Coventive Composites. 

Together, these technologies can reduce CNG tank weight by 10% and cost by 20%. The technologies are currently at TRL 6, and the objective is to overcome the 3 remaining barriers to demonstration at TRL 7/8:

1.	Materials: Optimise and upscale the carbon/polyamide tapes to meet cost, accuracy and property needs
2.	Process: Enhance the vessel-winding process to meet performance, weight and quality requirements
3.	Product: Upscale the manufacture of carbon/polyamide CNG tanks, to enable economic production

Overcoming these barriers will trigger our customers to start certification of the carbon/polyamide CNG tanks, as the next step in our commercialisation plan.

These innovations allow to set up energy indicators solely based on publicly available information, possibly charged but available to anyone. Kayrros has thus developed alternative methods to bypass the lack of relevant straightforward information. The accuracy and reliability of the information provided, as well as the reduced delays to deliver them, are at the core of Kayrros business model. As an information provider, Kayrros is part of the Business intelligence (BI) market for the energy sector. Its services aim to support trading activities and strategic investments, and address a wide range of stakeholders such as oil companies, commodity department of investment banks, oil trading companies, refineries, or equity funds, hedge funds, energy intensive industries, etc. With this SME Instrument project, Kayrros’ ambition is to boost the development of the company so as to become a worldwide leader in the business intelligence for the energy sector. The project will result for Kayrros in 50 m€ of increased revenues by 2021 and 87 job creations.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,KAYRROS,FR,,,

But a new EU directive, designed to save some of the 420,000 lives lost every year to air pollution in the EU, means that today’s technologies cannot meet the demands by any other means than adding expensive emission reduction systems to their solutions. This will make energy from biomass more expensive, lead to higher energy bills for consumers and threatens to put the Commission’s entire renewable energy roadmap at risk.    Dall Energy has developed a new, disruptive biomass furnace that reduces dust and particle emissions by more than 90% and can easily meet the demands in the new directive, and offer a whole new set of other benefits: • 30% lower investment (much simpler design) • 50% lower maintenance costs (no technical difficulties, low power consumption)  • Very wide load window (fast and easy modulation between 10 and 100% load without problems) • Up to 40% reduction of fuel cost as the technology enables conversion of a wide range of low-value fuels such as wet biomass, organic waste streams, willow, etc. in the same furnace.   For Dall Energy, there is a market of 150-250 new plants and 130-170 replacement plants annually in EU-28 alone. By 2023, Dall Energy expects a turnover of €140m and 375 jobs created in-house, as well as 1,038 jobs with EU-based suppliers as a direct result of this project.   The expected outcomes are an adapted furnace design and a demonstrated and validated furnace with a French host, Dalkia, as the first international customer be serve as a foothold for international roll-out of the innovation.

Such advantages are demonstrated by three case studies (Datacom transceiver, Optical encoder and OLCD display), showing the flexibility of the processing route and the superior quality of the produced parts.   Two control strategies will be tested for improving the yield: process monitoring/actuation, and functional quality assessment of the produced optoelectronic assembly. The mould cavity will be instrumented to verify the quality of the injected material and monitor the components alignment with respect to the optical features of the mould. On the other hand, the manufacturing path will incorporate an in-line optical and functional quality inspection system, with complete traceability of each produced part. The project will incorporate data-based quality awareness computing, supported by process abstraction, for predictive quality assurance and process adjustment based on cognitive control.   A pilot optical assembly line will incorporate all the advances in the project. Extended pilot test runs will allow to evaluate the robustness, quality and differential advantages of process and products, and quantify the productivity and effectiveness of the control strategies.

From an economic point of view, the important parameter is the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), or Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), which is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of an energy generating asset. The minimally expected LCOE for any solar energy system in 2030 is 0.045 [€/kWh], similar to today's Photovoltaics (PV) LCOE, and at the same level as fossil-fuels. In this proposal, we aim to demonstrate a Proof of Concept [PoC] for a low-cost CPV operating at LCOE of 0.025 [€/kWh] (50% reduction of PVs today). The proposal is a direct continuation of our ERC project on new thermodynamic ideas for solar cells, where we demonstrated that; In contrast to thermal emission, photoluminescence (PL) rate is conserved when the temperature increases, while each photon is blue-shifted (photon-energy increased). We also demonstrated how such Thermally Enhanced-PL (TEPL) generates more energetic photons, by orders of magnitude, than thermal emission at similar temperatures. These findings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump, and can harvest thermal losses in photovoltaics with a theoretical maximal efficiency of 70%, and a practical device/solution that can reach 48% efficiency. In our preliminary unpublished work, we demonstrate 42% TEPL efficiency compared to an ideal-PV. The challenge in this PoC is to demonstrate photon recycling, photon management, and thermal management, where the maximum of the PL is converted to electricity in an operating PV. We also performed a detailed breakdown of the costs related to TEPL based device. Based on our cost analysis, achieving 32% total conversion efficiency without a cooling system supports LCOE of 0.025 [€/kWh], which will significantly accelerate the usage of renewable energy.",150000.0,150000.0,ERC-2018-PoC,ERC-POC,TECHNION - ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,IL,,,

Enzymes can substitute harsh and energy-demanding chemical treatments for sustainable production of bio-based building blocks and products in wood biorefinery. However, wild enzymes, evolved to act under natural environmental conditions, cannot be integrated into the current industrial processes. WoodZymes partners already have available extremozymes resisting very high temperature and pH that will be further optimized to be used as biocatalysts in wood industries. Enzyme application will include the recovery of phenolic compounds from enzymatic breakdown of technical lignin, and of lignin and hemicellulose compounds from enzymatic delignification and bleaching of kraft pulp (also resulting in more sustainable final cellulosic pulp). Extremophilic enzymes will also be used to valorize the latter compounds as bio-based precursors for adhesives in the manufacture of medium-density fiberboards, and as components of insulation polyurethane foams (substituting fossil building blocks), as well as for obtaining renewable sugar-based papermaking additives.

The latest data collected show a yearly production of 9.637 thousands of tons in the EU28 countries. Sludge treatment issues are often neglected in comparison with water-related parameters which results in serious technical difficulties and highly expensive disposal methods. As a result, an energy efficient, environmentally sound and economically viable process for sludge disposal and reuse of valuable resources e.g. phosphorus hardly exists.
The most common disposal methods for sludge are spreading on agricultural soil, composting and incineration. Land-filling has been long banned, the use as fertilizer, although very moderate in costs, is being banned in many regions due to concerns about contamination of soils with heavy metals and endocrine disruptive compounds. Composting raises the same concerns, and it is a labour-intensive and unsafe process, which leaves incineration as the most used option, albeit an expensive and not effective one. Incineration entails the highest costs (80-110 € /ton), but is also considered the safest disposal method and is fast growing and widely adopted. It presents also technical difficulties, such as the low overall efficiency of the process, the huge logistic efforts required to transport the sludge to the incineration plants, or the disposal of the ashes after the sludge has been incinerated.
In this situation, our company, AVA has the objective to demonstrate and commercialize our proprietary technology for hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of sewage sludge, showing clearly technical and economic ad-vantages against the current sludge incineration method. We aim to increase the amount of sludge converted into high value products such as fuel, activated carbons for water treatment, recovered phosphorus, soil remediation material, carbon sequestration schemes and other applications.

However, there are two main obstacles to successful mass commercialisation: high manufacturing cost and insufficient life-time.
Elcogen's SOFCs have best-in-class electrical efficiency of 74%, their lower operating temperature allows lower cost (up to 76%) fuel cell systems to be produced by CHP system manufacturers. They are fully validated for standard manufacturing techniques, are fully tested by customers and approved as the best performing.  
Over the last 5 years Elcogen has developed the market for CHP (combined heat and power) and has now received purchase commitments from several customers. It has signed agreements with three key CHP Sumitomo Precision Products and LOI’s from SolidPower (Italy) and Convion (Finland). They are now waiting for large volume deliveries from Elcogen. Manufacturing scale up is a top priority now. Elcogen needs to plan the manufacturing plant scale-up with initial capacity of 2m cells p.a., envisaging revenues of €57m and EBITDA of €36m in 2023. 
The feasibility of the deployment of standard manufacturing equipment has been established during a Phase 1 study. It will be possible to reduce cell manufacturing cost by nearly 90% to €5 by 2021, compared with €40 for the current 2nd generation.
Elcogen will deploy a cost-effective method for mass production of SOFCs, cutting fuel cell system costs by 65% compared with current system costs. This will open the path to widespread adoption of stationary power generation, unlocking a €25bn\ market for fuel cell systems, of which ~ 1/3rd will be for SOFC unit cells.

This demonstration encompasses:  (1) Transformation into CHP: This will be demonstrated by delivering a minor amount of heat to the on-site biomass treatment process, while envisaging large-volume heat delivery to nearby industry. This will provide renewable local heat, enhancing the overall efficiency of the plant from 46% electricity-only to 70-90% in CHP mode, (2) Biomass feedstock: An integrated thermal pre-treatment process will enable utilisation of diverse sustainable biomass feedstock. This will minimise investment and operating cost while broadening the possibilities in term of geographical feedstock sourcing and quality (3) Biomass pre-treatment: The thermal biomass upgrading process of ARBAFLAME will deliver biomass fuel with handling and milling characteristics approaching that of coal, allowing for retrofitting with minimal adaptations to the existing power plant. The technical capacity of the demonstration plant will allow for maximum flexibility in upscaling the technology for future replication,  (4) Integration into power plant: The biomass pre-treatment and heat delivery system will be physically integrated within the existing power plant. Eliminating several cost and energy intensive steps (steam production, pelletizing) will be investigated, towards more cost-effective final design. This demonstration of an integrated very low-costs concept in large-scale energy production will pave the way to subsequent multiplication in commercial industrial projects, thus increasing the EU capacity for renewable power and heat generation.

A method (ISOPREP) is proposed for recycling polypropylene (PP) products into virgin quality PP and hence reusable for the production of the highest grade PP products. The method exploits a novel ionic polymer solvent designed for highly tuned solubility of PP, patented within the partnership, with the key advantages/innovations:
(1) A performance identical to PP resin freshly manufactured from fossil sources
(2) Cost effective compared with producing PP from fossil sources
(3) Reduces the reliance of PP production on fossil resources
(4) Achieves a step reduction on life cycle emissions and energy compared with the use of fossil resources 
(5) Is entirely closed loop with negligible loss of solvent per cycle and hence negligible emissions thus non-polluting
(6) The solvent is non-toxic and non-flammable in the process temperature range
(6) Removes dyes, colours and impurities
(7) Prevents sending end of life PP products to landfill and avoids them polluting both land and sea

PP is used in a huge variety of products such as automobile interiors, consumer goods packaging, electronics, construction materials, carpets and other home furnishings. The global PP market, accessible by the ISOPREP system, was estimated at €65bn per annum in 2017, totaling approximately 23% of the entire plastics market. Given the typically short life of PP products, only 1% of which are recycled, there is a great need to implement innovative and disruptive technologies to mediate this trend.

Although applicable to a wide range of products, the concept will be developed and demonstrated at pilot plant stage for recycling polypropylene carpet at TRL7, based on prior and patented knowledge within the partnership at TRL5.",6921935.0,6315555.0,H2020-NMBP-SPIRE-2018,IA,TWI LIMITED,UK,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET GRAZ;CENTITVC - CENTRO DE NANOTECNOLOGIA E MATERIAIS TECNICOS FUNCIONAIS E INTELIGENTES ASSOCIACAO;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;FLOTEKS PLASTIK SANAYI VE TICARET AS;BIONIQS LTD;LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY LBG;SABANCI UNIVERSITESI;AXION RECYCLING LTD;ROTAJET SYSTEMS LIMITED,AT;PT;DE;TR;UK,

ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:
Thermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;
Vibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;
Light energy from indoor artificial lighting. 
For these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, “trickle” sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, “pulsed” sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, “bursty” sources.

HarvestAll enables energy harvesting from any-single harvester type, many-identical harvesters and multiple-different harvester types. This functionality is not currently available in the market.

This new energy paradigm will require a major contribution from renewable hydrogen to be successful. Industries such as steel making, fertilizer production, chemical and petrochemical refining or glass making, already use hydrogen as feedstock or high heat for various ends. However, most of the production processes involve carbon-based energy sources and are highly polluting, contributing abundantly to global GHG emissions. Overall, industry was responsible of over 25% of the GHG emissions in Europe in 2015. The use of renewable hydrogen could reduce 20% of global CO2 emissions by 2050. 
In Hydrogenics, we have developed HyLYZER, an innovative industrial scale electrolyser, based on PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) technology, that generates on-site clean high purity hydrogen with zero-emissions from renewable energy sources at unmatched efficiency: 85% average at stack level. Our solution's impact in the reduction of GHG emission can be quantified as 1ton of H2 abating 10tons of CO2. We are a global leader provider of hydrogen solutions, with several market products for various ends and a solid reputation in the H2 industry.

Therefore, there is an urgent demand for smarter and more sustainable automotive solutions. Alternative fuels for fossil fuels are the key solution. Among the alternative fuel, the hydrogen is the most affordable and environmentally friendly solution. Thereby, the improvement in the fuel cell stack is a must. 
Metatron is a leader company regarding components of alternative fuels such as pressure regulator for CNG and LNG. Currently, for the first time, hydrogen gas regulators are developing specifically for fuel cell vehicles at Metatron.  The traditional H2 pressure regulators are designed for medical or chemical applications, and they have a single architecture using diaphragm technology. The innovative Metatron´s solution lies in an H2 pressure regulator designed exclusively for FCV with double stage architecture, piston technology and made of aluminium alloy which works at 700 barG. These unique features offer large mileage (up to 800 km), durability (15 years guarantee without maintenance), lightness (<1,8 kg), reliability (\/- 1 barG output pressure variation) and safety. 
M-H70 2.0 solution will benefit Auto OEMs specialized in FCV, H2 cylinder suppliers and fuel cell stack suppliers. Our close collaboration with some of the future customers i.e. BMW, Saic Motor or Sunrise Power, and the huge interest in our solution from Ford or Yutong reflect that M-H70 is extremely attractive to the target end-users. Within 5 years of its launch to the market, more than 40.000 units are expected to be sold, obtaining €9.9 million of accumulated profit and creating 12 jobs.

The core of this project is the application of an innovative technology, recently developed and proved successfully at pilot scale in Iceland, which can limit the production of emissions from geothermal plants by condensing and re-injecting gases or turning the emissions into commercial products. To both increase public acceptance and to generalise this approach, it will be applied by GECO in four distinct geothermal systems in four different European countries: 1) a high temperature basaltic reservoir in Iceland; 2) a high temperature gneiss reservoir in Italy; 3) a high temperature volcano-clastic reservoir in Turkey; and 4) a low temperature sedimentary reservoir in Germany. Gas capture and purification methods will be advanced by lowering consumption of resources, (in terms of electricity, water and chemicals) to deliver cheaper usable CO2 streams to third parties. Our approach to waste gas storage is to capture and inject the soluble gases in the exhaust stream as dissolved aqueous phase. This acidic gas-charged fluid provokes the dissolution of subsurface rocks, which increases the reservoir permeability, and promotes the fixation of the dissolved gases as stable mineral phases. This approach leads to the long-term environmentally friendly storage of waste gases, while it lowers considerably the cost of cleaning geothermal gas compared to standard industry solutions. A detailed and consistent monitoring program, geochemical analysis, and comprehensive modelling will allow characterising the reactivity and consequences of fluid flow in our geologically diverse field sites letting us create new and more accurate modelling tools to predict the reactions that occur in the subsurface in response to induced fluid flow.

While delivering many benefits, the current plastics economy has drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. The primary problem is the high material waste rate and poor closed-loop recycling in plastics manufacturing. Today, just 14% of plastics are used for recycling. To cope this problem, the European Commission has tried to implement increasingly stringent regulations, such as reducing landfilling or incineration, by increasing the taxes for waste disposal and promoting recycling. Nevertheless, the current inefficient recycling technologies make plastics recycled uncompetitive as raw material for many plastics converters. At TUSTI. BV. (Eindhoven, Netherlands) we have developed a smart solution to overcome these barriers. EGREMPLARE high-tech recycling process is a novel process that makes recycling of mixed plastics possible, allowing to increase to 60-85% the collected plastics to be recycled. We use our proprietary cleaning process that uses a bio-based material without not generation of new waste streams and with a low energy consumption. Companies have to pay less than landfilling taxes, contributing to the achievement of objectives set by the European Commission and reducing disposal cost. Since our foundation in 2015, we have invested over 350,000 euros to develop pilots tests, the bio-based cleaner, and process improvements. Now, based on the good results of our system, we aim to speed-up the technology to introduce our solution in the plastic recycled market. This market with such growth potential (predicted to increase at 6% CAGR up to 2022 reaching €42B), could greatly benefit from our eco-friendly and low-energy solution.

Larger section sizes are required to resist the higher load levels encountered in progressively deeper waters. This substantially increases cost, complicates logistics, generates installation difficulties, and causes greater environmental impacts. HSS material has the twin advantages of reducing the self-weight of structures and accruing associated cost savings. The installation costs typically represent up to 20% of the capital expenditure of an offshore wind farm. There is a need for more compact and lighter structures that can be easily sited on the seabed by standard installation vessels with lower crane capacity. Furthermore, the use of HSS provides increased structural resilience against strong cyclic loading in deep water environments, and reduces welding time due to reduced wall thickness. The benefit of HSS in static loading capacity is obvious, due to its increased strength. But there is a concern on deformation capacity for HSS connection, due to its lower ductility than normal-strength steel. In addition, the fatigue strength of HSS, especially at welded connections, remains an open question. HSS-WIND will investigate the application of HSS in offshore wind tubular platforms. The tubular joint is a common structural element in offshore wind platforms, and severe cyclic load, induced by wave and wind in the harsh offshore environment, may lead to fatigue fracture and failure at the vicinity of the welds. Reliable estimation of fatigue behaviour and resistance of HSS welded tubular connections constitutes an engineering challenge, essential for the platform structural integrity.

UGM monitoring is carried out in a limited number of enforcement laboratories through highly specialised technologies, mostly based on the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The development of faster, simpler and more cost-efficient analytical systems for UGM testing is greatly encouraged by law-enforcing authorities. The increasing number of functional nanomaterials with interesting properties and exhibiting specific biomolecule interactions, e.g. DNA-graphene, has brought a wide range of opportunities to the field of DNA detection.

FD determines the ecosystem’s resilience to environmental change and provides resilience to abrupt disturbances.

This lack of knowledge is enhanced by the difficulty to infer FD from communities that cannot be realistically sampled, such as most tundra ecosystems. Temporal dynamics of FD is rarely investigated but would give useful insights into how ecosystem functioning responds to change. The overall objectives of the project are: 1) determine FD across sampling locations and time periods based on environmental and remote sensing data, and 2) determine which edaphic and climatic factors are the main drivers of FD distribution. To accomplish these I will use remotely sensed data from state of the art technologies, i.e. hyperspectral vegetation signatures, vegetation structure, time series of satellite earth observation, and environmental data, incorporating them into a distribution modelling framework.

Devices like photovoltaic cells, light emitting diodes, electronic and optoelectronic micro-/nano-sensors are prominent examples of thin film applications where the precise control of material deposition and its degree of order (crystallinity) are of paramount importance for their performance and function. However, technologies for thin film deposition have very limited capacity to tune the material crystallinity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, or to create functional 3D architectures in a single and versatile manner. The requirement of high temperatures and vacuum conditions make them inherently costly and unsuitable for deposition on various substrates (e.g. plastics).

These materials can operate with a high thermodynamic efficiency and, showing an advantage over thermoelectric materials, they do not require bulky heat sinks to maintain the required heat difference. Hence, “pyroelectric energy harvesting” could be the right methodology to rescue some of the enormous amount of energy wasted as heat by converting the thermal fluctuations into
electrical energy (e.g. more than 50% of the energy generated in the U.S. is lost that way each year).

Such “solar-to-fuel” generating systems are targeted to store energy from sunlight in the form of chemical bonds which can be later broken with mild external stimulus to provide energy on-demand. Of these systems, the most studied for the collection and storage of solar energy is the photoinduced solar water splitting reaction, wherein liquid water is broken down into hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) using semiconductor photocatalysts.

Accomplishing this will enable more efficient treatment with less side effects. 
WHAT: RE-IMMUNE is an interdisciplinary programme in which the field of nanomaterial and nucleic acid nanotechnology merge to develop intelligent nano- encapsulated siRNA for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA in cancer-associated immune cells, to re-program and shift the tumor microenvironment from pro to anti-tumoral. To achieve this goal, I will undertake a high risk/high gain programme at the forefront of nanomedicine. The leading idea is to overcome the drawbacks of naked siRNA by combining two synergic strategies that will protect siRNA until recognition of its target site. I will evaluate intracellular trafficking of siRNA nanodevices and the silencing effect. I will also investigate possible synergic effect of a siRNA cocktail able to target different genes at the same time. Finally, I will evaluate the re-immunoediting action in vivo. 
HOW: The challenge met by the proposed program is to provide a groundbreaking contribution to cancer treatment. To achieve these objectives, I will combine the different scientific backgrounds and expertise of two leading scientists. Prof. Frank Caruso (University of Melbourne) is a world-wide recognized expert on nanomaterials and biomedicine, and Prof. Francesco Ricci (University of Rome Tor Vergata) leads a young and dynamic group at the forefront of DNA nanotechnology for sensing and drug-delivery applications. The fellowship will proceed through a well-defined set of research and training tasks. Thanks to this MSC Fellowship, I will diversify my scientific knowledge and acquire cutting-edge competences (in nanomaterials, microscopy, and nanoscopy), as well as complementary skills, which will become the foundation of my scientific independence.",250518.6,250518.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2017,MSCA-IF-GF,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA TOR VERGATA,IT,,,

Therefore, fibre-reinforced composites are a key technology, but they are not yet widely used due (1) to their high price, (2) overdesign due to a lack of toughness and (3) difficulties with recycling. Addressing these challenges through fibre-hybridisation requires a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with a strong background in both modelling and experimentation. Since such combined expertise is scarce, HyFiSyn aims to train 13 early stage researchers to become interdisciplinary, multi-talented experts.

As an alternative, high temperature- (HT-) PEMFCs based in phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole membranes are gaining much of attention due to the benefits over the LT-PEMFCs (e.g. no need of auxiliary humidification system, much higher CO and sulfur tolerance, very suitable for cogeneration in combined heat and power systems, easier thermal management, etc.). However, the main drawback is the high Pt content of the electrodes that, according to the state-of-the-art, is greater than 0.5 mgPt cm-2 (2-5 times higher than LT-PEMFCs state-of-the-art). This project aims to develop a novel configuration of the HT-PEMFC electrode that enable the achievement of low cost ultra-low Pt loading electrodes (≤ 0.1 mgPt cm-2) with competitive power output and durability. A paradigm shift is proposed in the structure and composiition of the catalytic layer of the HT-PEMFC electrode as no ionomer or binder is incorporated, only the catalyst and the electrolyte (phosphoric acid) are present. The absence of Pt site-blockers, as the binder or the ionomer polymers, significantly enhance the electrochemical surface area at  ultra-low Pt loadings enabling a reasonable performace output. Results of this project have a strong potential to be transferred to the electrode production in the emerging industry of HT-PEMFCs.

Cellulose is an abundant, renewable and sustainable biopolymer, plus it is biodegradable. Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), obtained with top-down approaches from cellulose sources, forms excellent gas barrier films ; however, their high hydrophilicity prevents their use in highly humid environments. It is therefore convenient to combine MFC with polymers in the form of composites. Crosslinked matrices guarantee high mechanical performances and water and solvent resistance. The uncured prepolymers can have very low viscosity, which allows for solvent-free mixing at room temperature. However curing often hinders recyclability. Reversible photocrosslinking of bio-based prepolymers, combined with MFC to obtain recyclable composites is innovative. 
To fulfil the final goal of the project, I will use MFC obtained from hemp hurd, a low cost by-product of industrial hemp decortication process, and a bio-based prepolymer, functionalized with a reversibly photocrosslinkable group, able to ensure the curing of the polymeric matrix upon irradiation at a given wavelength, and to allow its dismantling upon irradiation at a different wavelength.

As evidenced by recent studies, tree carbon uptake is directly controlled by environmental influence on wood (xylem) formation processes. Current knowledge on how and when climate influences these processes mostly come from short-term direct (weekly xylogenesis monitoring) and long-term indirect (width and anatomy of annual tree rings) analysis of tree growth. Nevertheless these approaches, related to different scales of investigation, cannot provide a complete overview of the complex climate influence on tree carbon sequestration, when used separately. 
INTREE aims at quantitatively assess multi-temporal climate influence on tree carbon sequestration in temperate and boreal forests. The project will focus on two conifer species, Picea abies and Picea mariana, along two elevation gradients in the Alps and one latitude gradient in Canada. A novel approach, the analysis of intra-ring wood anatomy along tree-ring series, will be used to create a link between different scales of investigation. Xylogenesis monitoring, tree ring analysis, and intra-ring quantitative wood anatomy, will be innovatively used jointly to assess intra-seasonal to multi-decadal climate variation influence on xylem formation processes. This new knowledge will be used to quantify climate influence on xylem cell number, size, and wall thickness in tree rings, and therefore to assess how climate variations affect the amount of carbon annually stock in the tree stem.
INTREE will promote the integration of different expertizes, methods and scales of investigation in climate change-related research. Outcomes will provide a unique contribution to current understanding of forest carbon sequestration, and provide mechanistic information for vegetation and carbon process-based models.

To ensure success of such ecological management, it is essential that both planning as well as implementation is informed by long-term ecological knowledge rooted in robust scientific inquiries. Examples of science-based ecological management are rare largely due to paucity of high-resolution past ecological modelling studies that are capable of producing tangible analogues and policy-relevant information on a multi-decadal timescale. To bridge this gap in the light of India’s National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) and its wider relevance to other tropical countries, EARNEST harnesses the recent past to provide guidelines for current-future ecological management of human-dominated tropical landscapes. Adopting innovative statistical approaches (e.g. REVEALS modelling, rarefaction and multivariate ordination) well-founded on palaeoecological science, EARNEST examines the resilience of Indian agroforestry landscapes in relation to past landscape burning and climatic transitions and delivers state-of-the-art understanding of the efficacy of fires in forest management and its implications for the efficient implementation of NAP.

However, cross-border sales constituted only 10.6% of Europe's total online sales in 2013, despite the European Commission’s (EC’s) estimate of €415 billion annual contribution to European economy from a European Digital Single Market (DSM), which is currently one of the top priorities of the EC. Besides language barriers and differences in legislature across the EU, the EC states that low engagement can be attributed to: 1) high compliance and delivery costs, 2) low consumer trust regarding foreign retailers’ delivery and after-sales support, and 3) low consumer awareness of foreign retailers. 

The EC has proposed several trade policy measures to facilitate a DSM. Yet, complementary operational business strategies that enable cross-border profitability under aforementioned challenges have not been explored, while trade measures are still under way. This project aims to develop an interdisciplinary modeling and optimization framework in order to study the dynamics of cross-border alliances between retailers for enhanced cross-border customer acquisition, distribution, and after-sales support. This much-needed framework will provide timely and reproducible models, leading to win-win horizontal cross-border alliances that leverage unique strengths of local retailers under high distribution and compliance costs, low cross-border consumer awareness, and consumer concerns on cross-border delivery and after-sales support. To that end, an interdisciplinary research that uses econometrics, economics, systems dynamics, and optimization literatures will be conducted to create models that can be translated into decision support systems.

By using thermal energy storage for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, the stability, reliability, and capacity factor of the plants are improved. Conventional CSP plants typically use mirrors, which are expensive to produce, install, and maintain. Apart from that, conventional thermal storages are also expensive as these are based on molten salts, which are expensive and their handling require special materials. Based on a novel micro-structured polymer foil, Heliac, Denmark, has demonstrated cost-effectiveness of the Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plants. The primary objective of “Small-scale CSP” is to design a novel thermal storage for Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plants. Detailed numerical works as well as experimental demonstrations are included. The intention is to design a packed bed storage system with heat storage charging and discharging using evaporation/condensation of one or more heat transfer fluids. For the thermal storage to be designed in this project, the cost is estimated to be around 4 €/kWh which is less than half of the cost of conventional storage system using molten salt (~ 11 €/kWh). The estimated cost of electricity and heat generation from the Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plant with storage (at Seville, Spain) is 38 €/MWh and 8 €/MWh, respectively. By involving research topics from different fields and collaborations with world-leading organizations from industry and academia, this is a truly inter-disciplinary and inter-sectorial project, ensuring its successful completion.

However, AD can suffer from the inefficiency of biogas production, which fundamentally arises from the low efficiency of mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) via hydrogen between bacteria and archaea. Dr Richen Lin proposes an advanced AD-based circular economy system by introducing conductive materials (such as biocompatible graphene nanomaterial and digestate derived pyrochar) for third generation gaseous transport biofuel production from algae feedstock. The proposal will particularly explore the mechanism of efficient direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between bacteria and methanogens in the presence of conductive materials. The biomethane production rate and total energy recovery in the proposed system are expected to be enhanced by 20-40% as compared to existing AD technology. The goal will be achieved by the following research objectives: 1) Theoretically compare the efficiencies of MIET and DIET in AD; 2) Develop optimal strategies to stimulate DIET and improve biogas production from algae; 3) Outline a future circular economy system by introducing pyrochar into AD.

Gravimetry is highly attractive because it can detect changes in subsurface mass, thus providing a window into processes that involve deep fluids. However, high cost and operating features associated with current instrumentation seriously limits the practical field use of gravimetry. 
NEWTON-g proposes a radical change of paradigm for gravimetry to overcome such limitations. We aim at developing a field-compatible gravity imager able to real-time monitor the evolution of the subsurface mass changes through continuous images of the gravity field. This system will include an array of low-costs MEMS-based relative gravimeters anchored on an absolute quantum gravimeter. The adjustable position, grid and shape of the array of sensors and the continuous logging of the gravimeters will provide imaging of gravity changes, associated with variations in subsurface fluid properties, with unparalleled spatio-temporal resolution. 
Specific work will be carried out to ruggedize the devices for field operation. We will deploy the new gravity imager at Etna volcano (Italy), where frequent gravity fluctuations, easy access to the active structures and the presence of a multiparameter monitoring system (including traditional gravimeters) ensure an excellent natural laboratory for testing the new tools.

Recently, several concerns have been raised about the unfairness of social computations pervading our lives ranging from the potential for discrimination in machine learning based predictive analytics and implicit biases in online search and recommendations to their general lack of transparency on what sensitive data about users they use or how they use them.

In this proposal, I propose ten fairness principles for social computations. They span across all three main categories of organizational justice, including distributive (fairness of the outcomes or ends of computations), procedural (fairness of the process or means of computations), and informational fairness (transparency of the outcomes and process of computations) and they cover a variety of unfairness perceptions about social computations. 

I describe the fundamental and novel technical challenges that arise when applying these principles to social computations. These challenges are related to operationalization (measurement), synthesis and analysis of fairness in computations. Tackling these requires applying methodologies from a number of sub-areas within CS, including learning, datamining, IR, game-theory, privacy, and distributed systems. 

I discuss our recent breakthroughs in tackling some of these challenges, particularly our idea of fairness constraints, a flexible mechanism that allows us to constrain learning models to synthesize fair computations that are non-discriminatory, the first of our ten principles. I outline our plans to build upon our results to tackle the challenges that arise from the other nine fairness principles.

The European Union has already installed over 50GW of wind power generating capacity and has planned to increase the use of wind energy in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the year 2020 (Tabassum et al., 2014). The use of wind turbines is nowadays the principal technology for generating electrical power from wind, and therefore wind energy converters need to be thoroughly investigated with respect to their capacity, effectiveness and integrity. It is widely known that wind energy potential (greater wind speeds) is greater in higher atmospheric levels, where wind flow is smooth enough as is far from the disturbed built environment. Therefore, higher towers are needed in engineering practice as the technology develops. The space used for offshore wind farms is also more flexible than that on land. For offshore wind turbines, their environmental loads are more complex than onshore ones including higher average wind velocity and wave loadings. Thus, this makes the development of a new tall offshore tower configuration imperative for the construction of offshore structures under wind and wave loadings.",183454.8,183454.8,H2020-MSCA-IF-2017,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM,UK,,,

The project proposes to demonstrate the efficiency of innovations on solar field cleaning, power-block cooling, water recycling system, and plant operation strategy. Among these are solutions to reduce solar field water cleaning needs, an operation and maintenance optimizer software including soiling forecaster, a MEE water recovery technology running on otherwise dumped heat from the solar field, and a cooling concept for the turbine condenser storing excess heat when ambient is too warm, then releasing it during cool night times.
The solutions will be implemented at two CSP operational sites, “La Africana” parabolic trough plant in Spain and “Ashalim” central receiver plant in Israel, to demonstrate significant reduction in water use while making CSP more cost effective, and achieving near-to-market status. The solutions are best applied together, but each will also bring water and cost savings on its own, thanks to their ability to fit any kind of CSP plant; dry, wet, or hybrid cooled, existing or future ones, tailored to location and policy framework. Their application will save more than 0.5 M€/year of operational cost for a 50 MW CSP plant. 
Regarding competition on water resources and humanitarian issues, the social acceptance of CSP will be increased by detailed analysis of case studies and education of local population to the benefits of solar energy.

High-enthalpy hydrothermal systems preferentially develop in tectonically active and volcanic settings. In such environments, faults have a major control on fluid flow and may affects the overall fluid distribution at depth. However, due to the lack of in situ data, predicting the role of faults on fluid flow is challenging and often requires complementary methods. NERUDA proposes an innovative and multidisciplinary approach, combining numerical simulations of fluid flow with deep Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT). The project aims at constraining the tectonic control on fluid flow in hydrothermal systems. High-enthalpy environments often have a multi-layered structure with deep reservoirs (>300 m). Classical cable-structured ERT methods cannot reach such depths. To tackle this challenge, NERUDA will use a leading-edge technology in the field of ERT methods. The newly developed IRIS Fullwaver system allows the acquisition of deep (up to ~1 km) 3D ERT surveys. This wireless system can be deployed in areas with sharp topography (e.g. volcanoes) where classical ERT is logistically not possible. Numerical simulations of fluid flow, calibrated on the interpreted ERT surveys, will be performed to assess the fault control on fluid flow. The currently available flow simulators are either not user-friendly or lack some functionalities to adequately study high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems. NERUDA will develop an open-source, user-friendly MATLAB hydrothermal module calibrated on deep ERT to investigate high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems. This module will be implemented in the world-widely used, open-source MRST (MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox). NERUDA is expected to have a strong impact on the scientific community by widening the accessibility to user-friendly numerical tools.",175419.6,175419.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2017,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE,CH,,,

This project aims at challenging this simplistic view by introducing the Chinese karst regions as a study area known as one of the world’s most fragile and degraded ecosystems, but also a hot-spot of global greening hosting mega-engineering conservation projects which are the largest in human history. Here my research hypothesis is that conservation efforts in China’s karst regions offset degradation and lead to an increased carbon sequestration with global impact. I aim to (1) develop methods to assess aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) losses and gains with newest satellite data, (2) attribute ABC dynamics to conservation and degradation using inventory data, (3) test the sensitivity of ABC to climate extremes and explain how conservation efforts affect these, and (4) assess the regional and global impact of observed ABC changes as a climate change mitigation measure. Whereas the host institution is world leading in satellite based assessments of climate induced greening of global drylands, me and my project will add a new dimension to the host’s portfolio: the human induced greening of a humid zone. Moreover, the host is world leading in the application of newest satellite data for vegetation cover and ABC assessments and has direct contacts to data developers (e.g. vegetation optical depth based on low frequency passive microwave data).

Because phytoplankton influence global biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration and climate, accurately modelling their growth is vital to forecasting our future. However, the models we use for global ecosystem forecasts do not consider how these factors interact, even though the interactions lead to qualitative and quantitative differences in outcomes. My goal is to therefore build a mechanistic understanding of how temperature and resources interact to influence phytoplankton growth, productivity and biogeochemical cycles.


This project has three objectives (i) develop statistical models describing how phytoplankton growth changes as a joint function of temperature, nutrients and light, (ii) develop mechanistic models characterising how temperature and resources influence cellular processes in phytoplankton, and ultimately their growth, and (iii) implement dynamic versions of the mechanistic model to forecast how marine phytoplankton communities will respond to future changes in temperature, resources and predation.

My work will involve applying machine learning techniques to published laboratory and field datasets to understand complex interactions between the three factors. By combining this understanding with insights from ecological theory, I will generate an accurate mechanistic model of growth, and then test the power of this model to predict patterns in the ocean using independent field datasets. Finally, I will use the validated mechanistic model to forecast changes to global patterns in phytoplankton growth and primary productivity.

This is the positioning of GOPV to develop highly competitive technologies for the PV utility market and strong synergies between European players. The project will accelerate reduction of electricity cost implementing advanced PV features and creating synergies across 5 topic areas: Light Management; Energy Efficiency; Material Efficiency; System Reliability; and System configuration and O&M. Ultimately, it will set up an integrated 500 kW PV system to demonstrate a competitive electricity cost of 0.02 €/kWh for irradiation levels of 1900 kWh/m²/year GHI in Southern Europe.

To achieve that, key actions will be implemented at three main levels within the PV value chain: PV module innovation level, power electronics innovation level and system integration level. To ensure fast uptake of the project results by industry, state of the art modules (c-Si and flexible CIGS) and power electronics products were utilised for adopting innovations developed by research centres. For cost reduction in system integration and operation, Digitalization and Data Management solutions based on Industry 4.0 approach will be adopted following successful utilization of Building Information Modelling approach in the construction sector. Selected for uptake innovations will be compatible with existing manufacturing technological processes thus reducing impact on Cost of Ownership and ensuring attractiveness of proposed technologies for PV manufacturers. 
Prototype SUPER PV systems will be produced in industrial environments and tested in different (including harsh) climate conditions to evaluate cost efficiency and demonstrate competitiveness of the proposed solutions. On the basis of test results, business cases for technologies under consideration will be performed, plans for production and market replication will be prepared. Project activities will be complemented by wide training and dissemination campaign ensuring highest visibility and social impact of the project activities.

This research specifically focuses on creating low-cost green biopolymer-graphene nanocomposites with tailored structure and properties via an innovative highly-efficient continuous engineering process. The core objective is to understand the fundamental physicochemical and rheological interactions between biopolymers and graphene with the smart use of novel additives/plasticisers, for precisely controlling composite structural evolution during melt processing. Initially, this will rely on the design of graphene and additives/plasticisers for the biopolymers, and then melt processing and plasticisation of biopolymer-based materials to realise specially oriented distribution of graphene on the nanoscale. Consequently, the interrelationships between processing conditions (affecting the interactions) and material properties (e.g. mechanical, electroconductivity) will be established. The understanding from this project is critical to engineering various biopolymer materials with tailored structures and properties for high-value application areas (e.g. biomedical, environmental). The advancement of knowledge will have a ground-breaking impact on the plastics industry by providing truly high-performance “green” polymer options in major new technology areas that traditional plastics cannot service.

This concerns in particular the fossil fuel-based energy sector as also stated in the H2020 topic “Secure, clean and efficient energy”. Harnessing solar energy by photovoltaics (PV) is the most promising way towards a decarbonized society. However, efficiency and costs of conventional solar cells are still hampering their broad application.

Recently a novel type of solar cell appeared based on metal-halide perovskite. Due to versatile and simple manufacturing methods, its unique optoelectronic properties and high electronic quality, this material has the potential to revolutionized PV by a unique combination of low-cost and high efficiency. However, there are still loss mechanisms present that need to be understood and eliminated to make this technology really a breakthrough compared to conventional PV.

This project addresses these losses, which are caused by defects (such as grain boundaries, interfaces to contact materials, and impurities) by a combination of in-depth optoelectronic and high-resolution structural characterization. The aim is to reach a completely novel operation regime, the “photonic solar cell”, which is at the same time a perfect light emitting diode. This is highly exciting from the physics point of view and directly relevant for application, because performance is increased. Furthermore, the obtained understanding of the defect physics will enable increased long-term stability (one of the major challenges) and accelerate the development of non-toxic lead-free perovskite materials.

This work is timely because trial-and-error engineering approaches, which were applied so far, have come to their limits. On the other hand, just now the quality of the ultrathin films used in the solar cell is sufficient to perform in-depth device physics studies, where I am an expert on.

However, the current research proves that the Two-Phase Flow Instabilities (TPFI) act as major hindrances in improving the efficiency of such HHFRDs. The TPFIs are known by large-scale fluctuations of flow causing pressure fluctuations, departure from a steady state, & mechanical vibrations to a system. Although the vast research on TPFIs began almost 80 years ago, the primary focus has been to identify the limits of conditions with & without oscillations & alternative control mechanisms. Today, to extract heat cost-effectively; force the HHFRDs to work in conditions close to these limits or even in the presence of TPFIs.

To overcome these limitations, continuous flow microreactors and catalytic membrane reactors have been considered for increasing the G/L interface area, but these systems require complex equipment and still do not guarantee an efficient L/S contact at the catalyst surface. For a major improvement on current systems in terms of cost efficiency and energy savings, G/L/S reactors operating at the nanoscale are required.
The aim of this ERC project is to design robust particle-stabilized G/L dispersions (i.e. micro/nano-bubbles and liquid marbles) as highly efficient G/L/S nanoreactors for conducting catalytic reactions at mild conditions.

We will (i) prepare NPs with defined sizes, shapes, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), including catalytic functions; (ii) generate particle-stabilized bubbles and liquid marbles affording highly active and selective reactions at the G/L/S interface with NP recycling after each catalytic cycle using external stimuli; examine the interplay between the NP assembly at the G/L interface and the catalytic properties along the reaction by combining well-designed experiments with simulations; and (iv) reengineer G/L/S multiphasic reactors using our particle-stabilized nanoreactors to achieve a high catalytic performance at milder operation conditions compared to conventional reactors while keeping a high degree of stability and flexibility at reduced layouts.

If coupled with innovative services offered by car manufacturers in a network of well coordinated partners supporting extensive and efficient End-Of-Life operations, the advent of E&HEVs could revolution the current mobility consumption uses of people and preserve the environmental much more than the only substitution of traditional cars with E&HEVs could do. In particular, non-ownership based models of E&HEVs with additional added-value services (leasing or renting contracts with periodic upgrade through remanufacturing, pay per use, etc.), would give OEMs the possibility to establish long-term customers relationships on one hand, and of setting-up innovative supply chains that performs systematic remanufacturing and reuse of E&HEVs parts in order to maximize the residual value of components and materials on the other. Remanufacturing, reuse and recycling would become the strategies upon which car manufacturers would base future competitiveness, leveraging on the benefits of costs saving and, at the same time, guaranteeing environmental benefits and superior performances to customers. 
However, there are substantial barriers to implement these new business models. The main one is developing adequate capabilities to remanufacture and reuse E&HEVs’ components and materials in order to provide customers with added value.

Drought events associated with climate change reduce tree growth and prompt mortality episodes, impacting global and severely forest ecosystems. The ability of trees to resist and recover from drought (tree resilience) will be decisive to maintain the functioning of forest ecosystems. Measuring tree climate-growth relationship and resilience is thus key for predicting the effect of climate change. However, because different tree populations may have faced contrasting climatic conditions, the within-species response to climate change may differ geographically due to local adaptation. TreEsilience proposes using tree rings to investigate the role of local adaptation in determining intraspecific variation in tree resilience to drought. To date, such an intraspecific approach has never been pursued. In order to reach this ambitious goal, TreEsilience will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines dendrochronology, phylogenetic comparative methods and species distribution modelling, thus bringing tools from the spatial and evolutionary ecology to the study of forest management and conservation.

However, the viability of perovskite solar cells is still far behind commercialization due to difficulties arising from little air-stability and inconsistent power output. The FASTEST project aims to synthesize air-stable inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) for their application in high-performance photovoltaics. Inorganic perovskite NCs exhibited outstanding optical properties, with photoluminescence quantum yield above 80%, i.e. low charge recombination losses. However, current nanoparticle synthesis methods use bulky, high-boiling point ligands which hamper the formation of high quality optoelectronic thin films, i.e. films with high charge transport and limited recombination, which severely limits possibilities of applications. This project will overcome these hurdles by engineering perovskite NCs by introducing short ligands for room temperature (RT) synthesis and compositional substitution with second metallic ions to stabilize perovskite NCs with an optimal bandgap. Furthermore, to attain air-durability as well as a good dispersion in solution states, novel polymeric passivating materials which protect perovskite NCs from degradation will be incorporated. These will develop effective strategies for enhancing the durability of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles from synthesis scheme to device operations. The technological advancement will be supported by fundamental studies on the photophysical properties of perovskite NCs related with physics of defect and perovskite degradation under controlled conditions of humidity, light, and temperature.

The building blocks of the perovskite materials are very low cost and the processing into the final perovskite thin-film can be achieved with low temperature fast processes. This makes these materials very cost efficient, and promises to deliver a future PV technology with a levelled cost of electricity (LCOE) below that of existing mainstream PV. There has been much advancement with combining perovskite with silicon cells, to deliver a “tandem” junction cell with much higher efficiency than either sub-cell.

Because the sustainable kerosene emits less soot and no sulphur, it meets future aviation air pollution standards. The conversion is based on plasma driven CO2 dissociation, solid oxide membranes and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of kerosene. Synergy between plasma activated species and novel perovskite electrodes of the oxygen separator are expected to raise CO productivity and energy efficiency. CO2 emitted upon fuel usage is recirculated as feedstock to the process by direct air capture. The technology is modular, scalable and relies on inexpensive existing infrastructure for storage, transport and distribution. In this project the technology readiness level is raised from TRL 3 to 4 by novel system integration into a container sized unit producing 1kg/hr kerosene. Projected cost at this stage of development are estimated at \50% of fossil kerosene. Market entrance will be facilitated by ETS, airline CO2 compensation fund and ICAO regulation.

Eco ice Kälte GmbH develops technologies to exploit this attractive market potential, to generate significant growth and with this contribute to achieving the climate targets. One very promising approach results from the globally rising use of LNG as energy source, since a huge cold capacity at -162°C is stored in LNG, which is hitherto completely wasted during the regasification by heat exchange with ambient air or sea water at port terminals and LNG end user’s sites, respectively. Eco ice has developed and patented an innovative technology (TRL6) in various output classes to recover this highly valuable cold capacity without additional electrical power or gas consumption and provide it very cost-efficiently to the market.
The Eco ice technology has the potential, without any self-consumption of natural gas, to create electrical power savings of 5.000 MW, i.e. to replace the fossil fuels for several large power stations. The cold market is increasingly looking for such cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternatives, as confirmed by customer feedback. Even in a conservative business scenario, which assumes a technology conversion rate of only 5%, a profitable short term growth up to a high two digit million € revenue value can be expected, as confirmed by ongoing negotiations with potential launching customers and business partners.

The growing penetration of converter-interfaced (thus inertia-less) Distributed Renewable Energy Sources (DRES) will eventually replace dispatchable SGs and increase power volatility, causing large frequency deviations and voltage regulation problems. The increase of SG spinning reserves, the grid reinforcement and the use of central electric energy storage systems are some solutions proposed to tackle this problem.

The increasing demand is attributed to the fact that biomass is the only renewable energy source providing solutions for all energy sectors: transportation, power, and heating and cooling.  
Due to this high demand, European biomass industry has the neccesity of making a better energetic use of the feedstocks and wastes, which are continuously generated but are practically unused in energetic terms due to their ash-rich content, which is regulated by the ISO 17225.
BiAR is a chemical proccess to remove the ash content from ash-rich lignocellulosic (e.g. bark, rice husks) up to 95% biomass or sludge digestate, that consists of 3 differentiated steps: 1) liquefaction of the organics through solvolysis, 2) ash content separation through filtration, and 3) recovery of solvents through distillation. BiAR is a process for the valorisation of wastes, increasing their efficiency as a fuel up to 90% but also increasing their economic value since the produced pellets will be sold at higher price thanks to the improvement in the quality. Thus, biomass pellets producers will be willing to pay for a process that will help them to increase their benefits per ton (in the worst scenario, they will increase the selling price from 129 €/ton Enplus B pellets to 230 €/ton EnplusA1). Thus, BiAR will increase the benefits of biomass pellet producers up to more than 200%.
Moreover, BiAR process in aligned with the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC), which sets a 20% target of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, with bioenergy playing a key role. BiAR will help to boost the Circular Economy in Europe since it is the only proccess able to valorise wastes and sludges, that nowadays cannot be used with energetic purposes.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,INSER ENERGIA SRL,IT,,,

Consumer co-ownership in RE – “Citizen Energy” – has proved successful in engaging consumers in financing RES, thus becoming “prosumers” which in turn induced positive behavioural changes in energy consumption. “Prosumer” models, however, are still not widely implemented across Europe. 

Guaranteed feed-in tariffs have facilitated the repayment of RE installation loans, but now a shift to auction systems favouring large-scale projects threatens this powerful incentive to citizens' investment. Moreover, the typical “prosumer” is male, middle aged and with a higher in-come whereas the participation of women and social groups vulnerable to fuel poverty is uncommon. The rebound effect and insufficient use of ICT solutions are additional problems.

This project aims at solving this problem by offering a nanoscale characterization platform for the European manufacturers of coatings, photovoltaic cells, and semi-conductor circuits. It is proposed to use a combination of scanning microwave microscopes, dielectric resonators, and simulation to measure the material and interface properties of complicated material systems and nano-structures. A metrological system of cross-checks between different instruments, models and simulations with associated error bars is indispensable for obtaining trustworthy results.

Scanning microwave measurements will be directly used for three-dimensional characterization of electrical properties of nanostructured semiconductors used in organic and hybrid photovoltaic cells. The objective is to accelerate the development of high efficiency cells and to have measures to predict performances in early stages of prototype production. Where process monitoring of materials with nanostructures is necessary, a dielectric resonator is used to translate insights from scanning microwave microscope measurements to fabrication environments. Such dielectric resonators could be directly integrated in production lines for monitoring thin film deposition processes.

This requires characterisation methods enabling one to quantify atomic structures with high precision.

The strong interaction of accelerated electrons with matter makes that transmission electron microscopy is one of the most powerful techniques for this purpose. However, beam damage, induced by the high energy electrons, strongly hampers a detailed interpretation. To overcome this problem, I will usher electron microscopy in a new era of non-destructive picometer metrology. This is an extremely challenging goal in modern technology because of the increasing complexity of nanostructures and the role of light elements such as lithium or hydrogen. Non-destructive picometer metrology will allow us to answer the question: what is the position, composition and bonding of every single atom in a nanomaterial even for light elements?

There has been significant progress with electron microscopy to study beam-hard materials. Yet, major problems exist for radiation-sensitive nanostructures because of the lack of physics-based models, detailed statistical analyses, and optimal design of experiments in a self-consistent computational framework. In this project, novel data-driven methods will be combined with the latest experimental capabilities to locate and identify atoms, to detect light elements, to determine the three-dimensional ordering, and to measure the oxidation state from single low-dose recordings. The required electron dose is envisaged to be four orders of magnitude lower than what is nowadays used. In this manner, beam damage will be drastically reduced or even be ruled out completely.

At Nowave Engineering Solutions S.L. we have developed an advanced multi-turbine system capable of efficiently capturing wave energy to produce electricity: ARRECIFE. While state-of-the-art WEC systems have reached a maximum capacity factor of 25%, Arrecife has already proven a capacity factor of 55%. This high performance is achieved thanks to the optimized design of Arrecife, which allows to capture both the horizontal (kinetic) and vertical (potential) energy components of the wave. Moreover, while most WEC systems are designed to work with waves of 6-8m, Arrecife is designed to work optimally with wave heights of 1-5 m, which constitute 85% of the available resource globally. Besides low capacity factors, other WEC systems are not competitive in our demanding energy market because of their high capital and operating costs, which results in LCOE of up to 110 €/MWh. Arrecife has a simple design, composed of commercially available materials, that reduces capital and operating cost and provides a LCOE of 46 €/MWh. Arrecife also incorporates a unique immersion mechanism, ensuring survivability during storms or under adverse sea conditions, increasing the lifetime of the system to over 20 years.

In addition to these challenges, decarbonisation of the transport sector requires massive production of renewable fuels especially for the heavy duty sector: air traffic, ships, heavy duty road vehicles. FLEXCHX project is aiming to present a cost-effective solution to tackle these challenges of the new European energy mix.

Principal ideas of the proposal are:
-  A hybrid process that integrates electrolysis to biomass gasification and synthesis is developed and the key enabling technologies of this process are validated to reach TRL5.
-  In summer season renewable fuel intermediate (FT-wax) is produced from biomass carbon boosted with solar energy driven electrolysis. A small amount of by-product heat is also produced to cover the summer-time demand for district heating. Biomass consumption is halved compared to the winter time operation and 50 % of the input energy comes from low-cost excess electricity.
- In winter season the plant is operated without the electrolyzer in a way that biomass conversion to liquid fuel intermediate,  heat and electricity is maximized.
- Most of the invested plant components are in full use throughout the year, only the electrolysis unit is operated seasonally

To complement these benefits we propose two unprecedented features: (1) an Energy Storage Management module, which will maximize the self-consumption of green sources of energy from a Battery Storage Energy System and (2) a Smart Grid Integration module, which will provide a virtual charge to balance the energy demand/response of electricity providers. The existing control technologies do not include any intelligence to implement an efficiency energy plan, and are mainly focused on centralized tools which are difficult to install and entail high initial investment and labour costs. Besides, no solution enables to predict the peak demand and maximizes the self-consumption of local green electrical energy. To ensure the viability of SEMS we will assess its technical, commercial and financial feasibility and the IPR exploitation, and define our Business Plan so as to achieve the market uptake in the targeted European countries in 2020. SEMS is aligned with the goals of the EU Horizon 2020 WP for Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy and the energy targets for 2030 by helping reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint by smart and sustainable use of electricity, promoting the use of low-cost, low-carbon electricity energy sources.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,STIGNERGY SA,CH,,,

with a large increase of production rate and output pressure of hydrogen, while assuring high efficiency and safe
operation. To address these challenges, a step-change in PEM electrolysis technology is necessary. The NEPTUNE
project develops a set of breakthrough solutions at materials, stack and system levels to increase hydrogen pressure
to 100 bar and current density to 4 A cm-2 for the base load, while keeping the nominal energy consumption <50
kWh/kg H2. The rise in stack temperature at high current density will be managed by using Aquivion® polymers for
both membrane and ion exchange resin. Aquivion® is characterised by enhanced conductivity, high glass transition
temperature and increased crystallinity. Dramatic improvements in the stack efficiency will be realised using novel
thin reinforced membranes, able to withstand high differential pressures. An efficient recombination catalyst will
solve any gas crossover safety issues. Newly developed electro-catalysts with increased surface area will promote
high reaction rates. The novel solutions will be validated by demonstrating a robust and rapid-response electrolyser
of 48 kW nominal capacity with a production rate of 23 kg H2/day. The aim is to bring the new technology to

This is the largest manufacturing sector in EU, composed mainly by SMEs (>99%). 
Technically, anaerobic digesters are NOT optimised for small volumes (<1,000 m3). So, most industrial wastewater treatment technologies are optimised for much larger volumes (average: 2,500 m3). Economically, these technologies are very expensive (>1M€). Thus, only big companies implement anaerobic digestors. Until now. In AEMA, we have been able to downscale a disruptive small scale anaerobic digestor for wastewater treatment, addressed to F&D industry: Multi-AD.
Multi-AD is a high performance MULTIphase Anaerobic Digester tailor-made for treating wastewater generated in Food and Drink SMEs. It is fully sensorised, being able to self-regulate basic operational parameters (T, flow…) for its auto-operation depending on the kind of wastewater characteristics it needs to treat. It will generate 80% methane-rich biogas that be partially used -50%- for its operation, and partially used -50%- for other energy-demanding industrial tasks (e.g. heating, at the industry choice), with average economic savings of 15,000€/year (when treating 100 m3/d) and 11% less CO2 emissions. 
We will commercialise it in the most important EU28 countries in terms of F&D industry, and as well in some countries in Latin America, being the flagship product for our internationalisation.  
We plan to sell in the first five commercialisation years 108 units of the device, what will imply that we will sum up to AEMA’s team 14 persons. The project will have a ROI of 2.82.

These sources are of major importance for quantum-information science and applications. SPSs experiments generally rely on the optical excitation of two level systems of atomic-scale dimensions (single-molecules, vacancies in diamond…). Many fundamental questions related to the nature of these sources and the impact of their environment remain to be explored:

Can SPSs be addressed with atomic-scale spatial accuracy? How do the nanometer-scale distance or the orientation between two (or more) SPSs affect their emission properties? Does coherence emerge from the proximity between the sources? Do these structures still behave as SPSs or do they lead to the emission of correlated photons? How can we then control the degree of entanglement between the sources? Can we remotely excite the emission of these sources by using molecular chains as charge-carrying wires? Can we couple SPSs embodied in one or two-dimensional arrays? How does mechanical stress or localised plasmons affect the properties of an electrically-driven SPS?

Answering these questions requires probing, manipulating and exciting SPSs with an atomic-scale precision. This is beyond what is attainable with an all-optical method. Since they can be confined to atomic-scale pathways we propose to use electrons rather than photons to excite the SPSs. This unconventional approach provides a direct access to the atomic-scale physics of SPSs and is relevant for the implementation of these sources in hybrid devices combining electronic and photonic components. To this end, a scanning probe microscope will be developed that provides simultaneous spatial, chemical, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Single-molecules and defects in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are SPSs that will be studied in the project, and which are respectively of interest for fundamental and more applied issues.",1996848.0,1996848.0,ERC-2017-COG,ERC-COG,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS,FR,,,

However, due to the complex interplay of numerous weak interactions at the interface the success rate of designed assemblies is currently below 10%. This proposal aims to increase the success rate of designing large protein assemblies, by using coiled-coils (CC) at the interface. CCs are some of the best understood protein motifs and can be designed with high success rates (>50%). A set of well-defined building blocks (CC-LEGOs) will be created by rigidly fusing CC bundles and natural oligomerization domains. Due to precise control of crossing angles enabled by the rigid fusion we expect that CC-LEGO structures will have the high design success rate and high solution homogeneity needed for further applications. A toolbox of CC-LEGO blocks will be designed and experimentally tested, capable of forming cages (tetrahedra, cubes, dodecahedra) as well as open 2D lattices.

The extended kinetic equation should include and clarify the role of the excess free Gibbs energy on the kinetics of electron- and ion-transfer, as well as the role of the double layer charge (Frumkin effect). A unified theory of charge transfer and transport will be proposed in the frame of the phenomenological theory of transport and of classic and extended irreversible thermodynamics. Since the investigated phenomena are complex and inter-linked, the investigation techniques must seize snapshots of the system during its evolution; this will be done by hyphenating the electrochemical techniques with quartz crystal microbalance, able to measure in real time nanogram mass changes. In order to cover the time-scales necessary to develop the phenomenological theory, we will measure dynamic impedance and differential immitance spectra with a dynamic multi-frequency approach. This is based on perturbing the system with a multi-sine signal and extracting the linear and non-linear current response and mass change.

Competing solutions require both current and voltage sensors at every measurement point to get a complete snapshot of the monitored grid. This is extremely inefficient, as every time a voltage sensor must be installed, a cluster of nearby customers is temporarily disconnected. 
In contrast, SynchroGuard is the first real-time and cost-effective solution that can be retrofitted to existing distribution grids without disruption, and provide fast response on transient grid events.

And now Navarra has developed a very ambitious energy plan for the region 'Navarra for 2030' which integrates 4 objectives linked with the reduction of CO2 emissions, the increase in percentage of renewables, maintaining security in energy supply and reducing energy poverty. Such objectives are to be achieved through technological innovation, management innovation and innovation in financial models.

Our project SustaiNAVility intends to work as a promoter of this plan in the area of energy efficiency, in particular supporting the goal of the plan of 'Reducing 30% consumption of primary energy with respect to the figures projected by the EU for 2020 in energy efficiency'.

This 3-year project has the general objective to promote under the umbrella of the energy plan of Navarra, energy efficiency in the region of Navarra in 3 target groups: public entities (municipalities and public buildings), private buildings (citizens) and enterprises, promoting an investment of 16.3 million euros in renewable and energy efficiency.

The concept of SustaiNAVility is the utilisation of the regional grants as boosters or drivers of the energy efficiency related investments, in projects incorporating the state of the art in technology and new funding schemes. The current project will have to face the following four challenges:
- Technological innovation.
- New services and funding schemes.

In recent decades, the integrity of the Asian grasslands became threatened by climate change and increasing land-use intensity, which in turn jeopardize the livelihoods of millions of residents that rely on the grassland resources for feeding their animals. To date, however, the spatial and temporal patterns of the changes in grassland resources across the region have not been systematically assessed. Moreover, it remains elusive how changing grazing intensity, climate variations, and institutional transformations have affected the grassland dynamics. This project aims to fill this gap by mapping the spatial patterns of vegetation changes across the Asian grassland biome for the past three and a half decades, and by quantifying the drivers of these changes. The dynamics of grassland greenness, as a proxy of plant growth, will be assessed using vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data. The changes in grassland greenness will then be statistically associated with climate data, subnational livestock statistics, and other control variables using spatial econometric panel analysis at fine spatial grain and annual temporal resolution. Combined, these analyses will shed light on the importance of climate variations and land-use intensity across institutional boundaries. Such insights are pertinent for deriving management options and policy solutions that simultaneously reduce grassland degradation and secure rural livelihoods in Asia.

With the objective of maximizing operational efficiency and green energy whilst improving the handling of the catch, we have taken the current hybrid ship concept to a step further and developed RENShip. Our innovative RENShip is a small fishing long liner vessel powered by a revolutionary hybrid system including a single small combustion engine powered by methanol and a set of lithium batteries, connected to onboard wind turbine and solar panels for supercharging.
European fishing fleets are major oil consumers and so, they are greatly responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s fleets. Moreover, current ship engines are excessively powerful diesel engines of 50-60% efficiency, resulting in excess of fuel combustion and cost (specially as fossil fuels prices increase over 50%), as well as causing noise and vibration impacting fishing effectiveness and crew’s health. With benefits such as >30% reduction in fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions and air pollutants (SOx, NOx), considerable reduction in underwater noise, access to fish product’s ecolabels and new tailored displacement hull form, RENship demonstrates its great business opportunity and potential to shift current shipping practices towards efficiency, lower costs and greener operation. 
Currently located at TRL6, we will integrate all components into a new design to build a pilot ship and validate RENShip in operational conditions, reaching TRL9. RENShip will be the first vessel totally operated by renewable energy and the smallest fishing vessel running with a hybrid propulsion system.

One of the most promising large-scale electrical storage technologies are Redox Flow Battery (RFB) systems, which can convert electrical energy to chemical energy and back again. Here the electrolyte is an electro-active species where the chemical energy is converted to electricity in a flow cell. RFBs can act as both batteries and a fuel generation device depending on the needs of the user, which is advantageous because they can be recharged without replacing the electro-active material. The vanadium RFB is a promising technology, but is critically limited by only being able to store one electron per species giving a low energy density (~20 W h kg-1) and poor stability restricting many applications. 

Using the artificial intelligence driven discovery system of the ERC Advanced Grant SMART-POM, we aimed at the discovery of new metal oxide molecular polyoxometalate (POM) clusters showing unexpected properties. For instance, we found a molecule that can store > 10 times more electrons reversibly than the vanadium RFB making these the molecules the most reduced molecules ever discovered. Here we want to make a major step in translating this ground-breaking outcome of SMART-POM from discovery of new clusters, to scale up so the molecule can be tested in a flow battery device set up.  The heart of any flow battery is the electron storage redox electrolyte. The more electrons the electrolyte can store reversibly the higher the energy density and we aim here to beat the state of the art by at least an order of magnitude aiming >1000 Wh L-1 (at this point applications in electric cars are possible).

Fuel cells need to be fed with a constant supply of oxygen, usually from air provided by a compressor. While much attention has been put on the fuel cell itself and the hydrogen storage, the oxygen supply has not been yet optimized. Currently, air management for fuel cell systems remains a challenge because today’s compressor technologies are not optimized for fuel cell applications. 

We are CELEROTON, a Swiss high-tech business at the forefront of high-speed turbo compressor technology. We are able to achieve speeds up to 300,000 rpm, which allows our product to be 20 times lighter and smaller than state-of-the-art compressors, while achieving the highest efficiency of all commercial compressors. Moreover, our compressor is 100% oil-free which results in the highest air purity, crucial to increase the fuel cell lifetime.
 
Since our foundation in 2008, we have invested over 1.6M€ to develop our compressor technology up to near-commercial stage. Now, with project TURBO-FUELCELL, we aim to take the last technical and commercial steps to introduce our unique turbo compressor as the key technology for oxygen supply in the fuel cell vehicle market.

of bone density, a natural process that begins after the age of 30. The risk of fracture grows proportionally to the disruption
of the bone architecture, advancing from minor osteopenia to severe osteoporosis, which is a global public health concern
that affects today 200 million people. In the EU, the costs derived from osteoporotic fractures reach today €37billion.
Although the reason for bone loss in the adult age is poorly understood, it is believed to be due to a lower capability to
absorb minerals from our diet. Thus, in the adult age clinicians recommend the intake of mineral supplements to cover for
the dietary insufficiency. Although most bone health supplements are based on calcium, it is the mineral silica the one with
higher impact on bone mineralization. Despite its recognized effects on bone and connective tissue, its market uptake has
been long hindered due to the low concentration, low bio-availability, inadequate presentation and poor absorption rates of
current supplement products. In response, we at geoSilica have developed geoBone, a silica-rich drinkable supplement that
offers this mineral in high concentrations and in the highest bio-absorbable form. Its properties result from our unique
production method, which purifies silica from the mineral rich water byproducts of geothermal power plants. After validating
the concept and production sustainability, this project aims to take geoBone to market readiness by finalising its
development & industrialising its production process. The Feasibility Study planned in Phase 1 will serve to warrant the

The current rail signalling system remains shockingly antiquated throughout the world. Firstly, the electronic signal’s messages are fixed during production. This means that customised signals must be designed, ordered and manufactured every time needs change. Secondly, there is a huge amount of cables and interlocking stations that require installation and maintenance and increase operational expenditures. Thirdly, the current railway monitoring system is rudimentary and requires unnecessary energy consumption.
The solution we propose, LEDVAR-Z, is an innovative ITC system that will standardise and modernise railway signalling, making it more efficient. It is composed of high-quality LED signals able to display any type of light or message and software that intelligently monitors and controls what is displayed. Fewer interlocking stations will be needed and they can communicate with signals through fibre optic cables or radio networks. As a result, LEDVAR-Z will drastically reduce costs for railway companies, streamline rail projects and improve rail traffic control management.

Dibenzyltoluene, the LOHC material used within HySTOC is not classified as a dangerous good, is hardly flammable and offers a five-fold increase in storage capacity compared with standard high pressure technology, leading to a transport cost reduction of up to 80%. HySTOC comprises 5 partners (including 2 SMEs, 1 industrial and 2 scientific partners) from 3 European countries (Finland, Germany, The Netherlands). The partners cover the whole value chain from basic research and testing (FAU & VTT) through core technology development (Hydrogenious Technologies and HyGear) to the end-user that will operate the LOHC-based hydrogen infrastructure (Woikoski). The comprehensive and complementary mixture of expertise and know-how provided by the consortium ensures not only an efficient realization of the technical and (pre )commercial objectives of the project, but also the subsequent dissemination and exploitation of the achieved results to maximize its impact within the consortium and the hydrogen market as a whole. In the long term, the LOHC technology developed within HySTOC will allow integration of renewable energy by making it available to hydrogen mobility in an easy-to-handle form and will thus help decarbonize the world.",2499921.25,2499921.25,H2020-JTI-FCH-2017-1,FCH2-RIA,HYDROGENIOUS LOHC TECHNOLOGIES GMBH,DE,OY WOIKOSKI AB;FRIEDRICH-ALEXANDER-UNIVERSITAET ERLANGEN NUERNBERG;Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT Oy;HYGEAR BV,FI;DE;NL,

The challenging issue of achieving concomitantly high efficiency, high flexibility in operation and cost optimum is duly addressed through improvements of rSOC components (cells, stacks, power electronics, heat exchangers) and system, and the definition of advanced operation strategies. 
The specifications, detailed system design and the advanced operation strategies are supported by modelling tasks.
An in-field demonstration will be performed in a technological park, where the Smart Energy Hub will be coupled to local solar and mini-hydro renewable sources and will provide electricity and heat to the headquarters of the park. It will demonstrate, in a real environment, the high power-to-power round-trip efficiency of this technology and its flexibility in dynamic operation, thus moving the technology from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 6.
The Smart Energy Hub being modular, made of multistacks/multimodules arrangements, scale up studies will be performed to evaluate the techno-economic performance of the technology to address different scales of products for different markets. 
To reach these objectives, REFLEX is a cross multidisciplinary consortium gathering 9 organisations from 6 member states (France, Italy, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland).

The shifting from fossil fuel to renewable energy has been slow mostly due to technological barriers. Meanwhile, the demand for energy is growing rapidly which makes fossil fuel consumptions inevitable, in spite of their high emission of GHC. Therefore, there is need for an immediate-medium term solutions to address CO2 emission of fossil fuel plants fast and in a cost effective way. CO2 capture technologies recognized one of the direct answers to this problem. 
Currently, CO2 capture technologies have been adopted in different parts of the world but still there is a long way to reach their full potential. Some of the most important barriers are large energy requirements and high cost. Advanced material solutions can play a significant role in price reduction and increase of efficiency and enable industries to use fossil fuel while reduce emission of GHC drastically.
GENESIS project aims to develop and upscale some of the most promising material for CO2 capture and demonstrate their performance, durability and reliability in industrial environments. GENESIS is build upon two previous ambitious EU projects that developed IPOSS and MOF membrane systems with a great performance for CC. GENESIS will take these technologies a step further by scaling up the most promising ones by demonstrating in relevant 0.45 MWe capture process for pre-combustion and 2 post-combustion applications and achieve at least 90% of CO2 recovery at a cost of 15€/MWh in two carbon intensive industries (Cemex & Arcelormittal).

Degradation investigations will be based on consolidated data (objects with known history and ageing data) from both real systems tested in cars and ID-FAST test program to ensure relevant analysis of failure modes and performance losses together with a mean to validate the developed methodology. Investigation of stressors impact on components degradation and performance losses will give access to the accelerating factor for each single mechanism AST.
Thanks to the expertise of partners, understanding will be ensured by advanced ex-situ and in-situ characterisations to identify and quantify components degradation phenomena, and by modelling and multi-scale simulation tools to investigate the impact of various stressors and to relate causes to  performance losses.
Combined AST protocols will be developed and validated with regard to their capability to actually reduce testing time and their relevance assessed by correlation to real world ageing. The methodology developed will allow prediction of stack lifetime and thus will be valuable for the whole automotive fuel cell community.

Low carbon intensity methanol production with CRI technology reduces carbon emissions by more than 90% compared to fossil fuels. ETL is a sustainable process of renewable fuel production which has no impact on our food chain or land use. Methanol produced by CRI can also be directly used in the chemical industry for the manufacturing of sustainable goods such as paints and plastics.

- Engaging a number of Competence Centres (CCs) that can provide an easily accessible environment for developing, evaluating, testing, and demonstrating novel robotic technologies.
- Offering direct financial support through a cascade funding mechanism to supplement the technical excellence offered by the CCs, allowing prototype/product creation and promotion
- Offering mentoring and support in developing business cases and managing the complete chain from “idea to market product” by EU champions in robotics that have successfully undergone the process
To achieve these objectives ESMERA involves 4 renowned robotics CCs (LMS, CEA, TUM, TEKNIKER) and 3 industrial partners/ facilitators (R U Robots, Blue Ocean Robotics, COMAU) who are at the forefront of EU robotics technology development. The project aspires to realize research experiments in two phases:
- Phase 1 – Proof of concept: Carrying out 32 experiments organized in 2 Groups competing under 8 different challenges from 4 industrial sectors (energy, manufacturing, agri-food, construction). CCs will be supporting development activities with technical expertise and access to their state of the art facilities and equipment.
 - Phase 2 - Industrial Leadership and Business Support: Selecting 16 Challenge winners and providing further means for industrialization and commercialization of their solutions. Further RTD support by the centres and mentoring on business models and market outreach by the project facilitators.

Germany is shutting down nuclear power plants and the fate of coal-fired power plants has been determined by the climate agreement in Paris. In short - fossil fuels will be replaced by renewable technologies. This is in line with the Renewable Energy Directive, that requires the EU to provide 27% of its energy generation from renewables by 2030.

Adaptive has developed a unique energy storage solution offering a short-term, high-power output. This has been identified as the most efficient way to stabilize the power grids. Transmission system operators need the flywheel to find a balance between energy generation and consumption. This allows electricity grids to operate without conventional power plants while keeping the grid stable.

This project will investigate the business cases for dynamic grid balancing with the innovative and adaptive flywheel by questioning key stakeholders in several markets. The flywheel is modular and offers unparalleled configurability in terms of power to energy ratio, which makes it the first dynamic energy storage system whose discharge duration can be matched exactly to the customer’s needs.

After the feasibility assessment, Adaptive will apply for Phase 2 funding to build a pilot installation outside of Central Europe. This enables the company to further scale up its business and increase its revenue while allowing the creation of new jobs along the supply chain and providing a high return to the EU economy. In addition to that, it allows for a global reduction of CO2-emissions by increasing the permissible share of renewable energy in electricity grids.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,ADAPTIVE BALANCING POWER GMBH,DE,,,

Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) exhibit especially high melting temperatures and include the diborides and carbides of zirconium and hafnium (ZrC & HfC).  Unfortunately, UHTCs also suffer from poor fracture toughness, relatively poor oxidation resistance and are very difficult to process since the densification temperature required is also very high. EREMOZ will address these challenges by using a non-conventional process route along with a combination of fibre reinforcement and rare earth dopants. Specifically, processing will be based on the energy efficient process of chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) rather than more conventional sintering; the former allows dense composites to be produced at much lower temperatures. The poor fracture toughness will be improved by the introduction of silicon carbide fibres (SiCf) or carbon fibres (Cf), which enhance resistance to crack propagation. Finally, oxidation resistance will be improved by the introduction of second phases, such as those based on silicon and/or rare earths, which facilitate the formation of oxide scales that inhibit oxygen diffusion. The outcomes from this project will be three fold, to: 
1. Determine whether the presence of the rare earth element (e.g. La,Eu, Nd, Ce, Y) dopants will improve the properties and performance of the composites and whether they have any effect, positive or negative, on the processing required; 
2. Produce composites that display enhanced toughness compared to monolithic UHTC ceramics;

Currently, re-using Li-ion batteries in 2nd-life applications is not as simple as removing a battery from a vehicle then installing it directly into a stationary system. Before a battery can be reused, it first must be manually removed from a vehicle and the pack disassembled into individual cells that must be tested to determine the battery’s state of health (SoH), sending batteries without sufficient remaining capacity to be recycled. Even within the batteries suitable for reuse, cells must be sorted by similar remaining capacity, or else the 2nd life system performance would suffer. Thus, there are still clear technological, environmental and social needs in the field of reconditioning and reuse of existing Li-ion batteries of electric and hybrid cars within the small Electric Vehicles (EV) sector.

The capital costs represents 78% of CoE and can be broken down into several categories, with around 54% attributable to wind turbine, from which the blades represents 30%.

CoE can be reduced by maximizing energy production for the site by installing larger turbines. However, as the length of current rotor blades increase, their associated cost and weight increase at a faster rate than the turbine’s power output. Furthermore, as blades get longer they are becoming increasingly more difficult to manufacture and transport setting the limit at 90m.

Winfoor (WF) and Marstrom (MC) aim to pursue this market opportunity by bringing to market its innovative and ground-breaking blade technology – Triblade. Triblade is a “3-in-1” modular blade, built as a Composite Material Truss that will allow rotor blades to be longer (up to 50%), stiffer (up to 290%) and lighter (up to 78%), whilst reducing around 65.2% production costs and increasing ease of transport and installation resulting in up to 15.5% CoE reduction. These are game changing improvements that can play an important role in driving the development of next generation of larger turbines and accelerate the transition to greater use of renewables worldwide.

But only 5% of worldwide produced plastic is today recycled, being one of the least recycled material. Plastic wastes that are not recycled are called Ultimate scrap residues and come mostly from End-of-life vehicles (ELV) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Today, companies producing Ultimate scrap residue have two options to discharge this waste: 1) Landfill disposal where they must pay a considerable fee (120€/t in 2015) with a strong environmental impact but this practice is expected to be soon banned in Europe; 2) selling and sending the wastes to Asia (mostly in China) at a price of 250€/ton but with the requirement of investing in expensive pre-treatment systems and with also negative environmental impact. Our TRIBOSORT technology is a unique solution that allows to 1) recycle all ultimate scrap residues from ELV and WEEE, 2) separate its valuable plastic components with a purity of 95% minimum, 3) provide an industrial scale solution with a production capacity of 1.5t/h, 4) produce a final recycled plastic material directly marketable to manufacturers, 5) provide a Recycle certificate along with our final products.

Whilst these will meet CCM demand for the next 10 years, the growing requirement for increased numbers of CCMs thereafter necessitates a manufacturing step-change, both in terms of cost and capacity. MAMA-MEA will address this by assembling a consortium with extensive knowledge and expertise both of fuel cell technology and manufacturing in the digital coating and printed electronic industry, to develop the highly innovative concept of an additive layer manufacturing (ALM) process for the edge-sealed CCM. The key CCM components (anode and cathode catalyst layers, ion-conducting membrane and edge seals) will be deposited with high precision and speed, one component layer on top of the other, and just in the areas of the CCM where they are required for functionality. Preliminary one-off prototypes have established the feasibility of the approach, and patent applications have been filed.  MAMA-MEA will develop this innovative ALM process from MRL3 to MRL 6, by integrating the CCM components in to a single continuous roll-to-roll manufacturing process and validating the sealed CCMs in two full-size stationary application PEM fuel cell stacks.  A key project objective will be an increase in the manufacturing rate of over 10 times compared to the state-of-the-art process, whilst also increasing material utilisation to 99%, and the product quality, and thus yield, to over 95%. Overall, sealed CCM direct materials and manufacturing costs will be reduced by up to 58% in the new CCMs.  The project will also conduct comprehensive ex-situ characterisation and in-situ fuel cell performance and durability testing and provide an engineering design of an ALM sealed CCM production line, including quality control methodologies.",3189816.0,3189816.0,H2020-JTI-FCH-2017-1,FCH2-RIA,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET CHEMNITZ,DE,JOHNSON MATTHEY FUEL CELLS LIMITED;NEDSTACK FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY BV;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;SYSTEM SPA;INEA INFORMATIZACIJA ENERGETIKA AVTOMATIZACIJA DOO;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI MODENA E REGGIO EMILIA,UK;NL;DE;IT;SI,

To support the dissemination of climate services, a pilot of the DST will be developed in two steps. The first will draw on historical case studies pointed as relevant by energy companies - e.g. periods with an unusual climate behaviour affecting the energy market. The second step will improve probabilistic S2S real-time forecasts built up into the DST and assess their performances in real life decision-making in these companies. This process will be co-designed with consortium’s partners which represent different needs and interests in terms of regions, RE sources (wind, solar and hydro) and electricity demand. Besides the partners, S2S4E will engage other users from the energy sector as well as other business areas and research communities to further explore DST application and impact. As a result, DST will enable RE producers and providers, electricity network managers and policy makers to design better informed S2S strategies able to improve RE integration, business profitability, electricity system management, and GHG emissions’ reduction.

However, in the residential market, there is a time-shift (i.e. the duck curve) between the electricity consumption curve and the PV electricity production, with largest consumption in the morning and evening, while most PV production is during daytime. Currently, these differences are managed in the following way: during the day, excess PV electricity production is fed into the utility grid, and the producer receives a payment based on the Feed-in Tariff. At night, electricity consumption is maintained by the utility grid at normal costs. In the past decade, this system was supported by attractively high Feed-in Tariffs. However, due to very large number of PV installations the Feed-in costs for utility grids have grown exponentially and new payment models have now much lower or even zero Feed-in Tariffs for microgeneration in residential buildings, in most EU countries. Thus, there is now an economical incentive for electricity storage.
With this innovation project, we aim to pave the way for market introduction of the most cost-effective solution for storage of locally produced PV energy at residential buildings. To reach this goal, VisBlue is developing a storage system based on Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries. The ultimate value proposition for end-users is the lowest cost in terms of EUR/kWh/cycle on the market, ensuring as low as 9 years of payback time, which is significantly lower than any of the competing solutions.

Although the efficiencies of perovskite devices are rising fast, both PV and LEDs fall short of out-performing current technology and reaching their theoretical performance limits. To achieve their full potential, parasitic non-radiative losses and bandgap instabilities from ionic segregation must be fundamentally understood and eliminated. HYPERION will address these issues by i) elucidating the origins of non-radiative decay and ion segregation in films and devices, ii) devising means to eliminate these processes, and iii) implementing optimised materials into boundary-pushing PV and LED devices. This will be achieved through a groundbreaking hierarchical analysis of the perovskite structures that not only characterises thin films and interfaces, but also the sub-units that comprise them, including grain-to-grain and sub-granular properties. The optoelectronic behaviour on these scales will be simultaneously correlated with local structural and chemical properties. HYPERION will use this fundamental understanding to eliminate non-radiative losses and ionic segregation on all scales through passivation treatments and compositional control. Addressing these knowledge gaps in the operation of perovskites will produce fundamental semiconductor science discoveries as well as illuminate routes to yield optimised and functional perovskites across the broad bandgap range 1.2–3.0 eV. These will be used to demonstrate all-perovskite tandem PV devices with efficiency exceeding crystalline silicon (26%), and white light LEDs with efficacies surpassing fluorescent light (50 lm/W).

The current economic system is strongly based on consuming and discarding these materials and products. Combined with the growing population and strong economic growth this leads to a rapid depletion of the earth’s valuable resources while creating huge amounts of waste. To overcome this, it is essential to change our current linear economy and move towards a sustainable circular economy in which resources are reused and recycled while eliminating the production of waste. 

Many circular initiatives have failed to create sustainable material cycles due to a lack of usable information on material contents. This information is of utmost importance to allow re-use and recycling of materials and thus, to maintain the material’s value. Consequently, this will result in the thoughtful deconstruction of products, maintaining their valuable materials and subsequent re-use or recycling, minimizing waste.

To facilitate this highly needed information exchange and to facilitate the vital transition towards a circular economy, Madaster Services BV and Winvision BV have developed the disruptive Madaster ICT Platform which, for the first time, is able to precisely document and store material-related information of products. This innovative solution specifically focusses on the construction sector with the strong ambition to eliminate waste.

The following project objectives are defined: 
1. Produce Material Passports of construction objects in an operational setting; 
2. Develop protocols for data extraction and integration of resource-related information of construction;
3. Create an open-standard IT infrastructure to enhance interoperability with other systems that will make use of the resource-related information of construction objects in the database;

Intermittent generation will require extensive electricity demand flexibility - beyond conventional solutions - to alleviate the unpredictable grid stresses in high VRES times. This flexibility cannot only come from electricity end-uses, the volatility and variability of RES generation is too high. Energy system decarbonisation will necessitate the use of novel conversion and storage in alternative energy carriers and their networks to achieve the avoidance of RES generation curtailment.
The PLANET aim is to design and develop a holistic Decision Support System for grid operational planning and management in order to explore, identify, evaluate and quantitatively assess optimal strategies to deploy, integrate and operate conversion/storage systems on the distribution grid of several energy carriers within boundary constraints of real deployments outlined in the future energy system scenarios. Such tools are crucial for policy makers and network operators who need support in decision making process.

Most of the fascinating properties of the lanthanide and actinide materials are related to the partially filled 4f/5f valence shell and in contrast to the rest of the periodic table, are poorly understood.  This includes the surprising reactivity, magnetic and crystal structure properties and, the rather unpredictable, covalent or ionic nature of their bonds. It is now possible to study the chemistry of the f-block elements using state-of-the-art techniques that were not available before. Two new synchrotron-based techniques, high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), can now provide unprecedented detailed information on processes such as the electron-electron interactions, hybridization between molecular orbitals, the nature of their chemical bonding, and the occupation and the degree of the f-electron localization. Therefore, I propose to apply these cutting-edge techniques to advance the fundamental understanding of the lanthanide and actinide nanoparticles, an outstanding problem in materials science, chemistry and environmental science technology. The research will be conducted at the European Synchrotron (ESRF), at the Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL) dedicated to actinide science, where we recently installed a novel X-ray emission spectrometer with ground-breaking detection limits. The experimental work will be complemented by electronic structure calculations.

But the efficiency is low because the methane producing bacteria in the biogas digester have trouble accessing the energy locked in fibrous materials such as cellulose and lignin. This fraction passes through the biogas plant unused and is incinerated or spread on agricultural land. At the same time, mushroom producers must buy substrate to grow mushrooms and pay to discard it after use.

The solution: The AST technology creates a resource cycle between biogas production and mushroom production, reducing costs of mushroom production by up to 50% and utilizing also the fibrous fraction in biogas plants. The innovation is a technology where the fibrous fraction from biogas is used for growing mushrooms, and then returned to the biogas plant, offering improved economy as well as significant environmental benefits to both the mushroom and biogas industry. 

The project: The AST concept has already been proven in pilot scale, and the next step is a full scale demonstration plant. In this project two AST plants are scaled up and integrated with mushroom production facilities and a biogas plant, respectively. It is essential for the market introduction and thus the commercial success to demonstrate such commercial operation for customers to invest in such plants.

Impact: The project will increase the competitiveness of the European mushroom industry currently under strong pressure from China, as well as the biogas industry, suffering from high operational costs. 

The market: Biogas plants are rapidly being established to support the renewable energy transition with more than 15,000 plants currently in operation in Europe. The European mushroom industry uses about 3 m tons of substrate annually and grows with 10%.

Recently emerged organic-inorganic perovskites, offer to harvest light at cost effective price. Perovskites hold merits to the existing materials, however, a fundamental challenge for high performance devices is to optimize the crystals for maximize charge carrier generation and minimize recombination losses. Their widespread use is, however, limited by insufficient stability, scalability and reproducibility. We have recently developed new concepts to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite solar cells at lab scale that are potentially up-scalable to industrial production. MOLEMAT will accomplish this by, pioneering innovative methods and will demonstrate that molecularly engineered materials enable the tuning of the charge transport and interface. Our interdisciplinary approach, combining materials science, chemistry, device physics and engineering, will not only lead to improvements in the performance and stability of perovskite solar cell beyond 24% at lab scale, but will also provide deep insights in the functioning of solar cells. The success of MOLEMAT will rapidly advance the field by enabling reproducible and stable performance adding a significant value with respect to current state of the art. However, for making it marketable product, several developments are required and the MOLEMAT targets will provide relevant answers to three key limitations: encapsulation, stability and cost competitive materials. MOLEMAT envisages the development of 30×30 cm2 modules, with a power conversion efficiency of c.a 18% and a lifetime of 10\ years.

DHs have traditionally been designed to be operated in a hierarchized way, with central energy production facilities delivering heat to a variety of distributed consumption locations.
DHs are identified as key systems to achieve the de-carbonization of heating energy in European Cities. Renewable and waste heat sources are foreseen at the same time as de-carbonized heat sources and the way to guarantee competitive energy costs with limited influence of fossil fuel supply price volatility. To achieve this, conversion of DHs is needed regarding:
- The reduction of their operation temperature to avoid current technical constraints in the integration of low-grade industrial heat sources,
- The introduction of larger shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in the DH network.
- The introduction of distributed heat sources (reject heat from cooling equipment...).
- To guarantee economic viability with the trend of DH heat load reduction due to the evolution of the building stock toward NZEB (Near Zero Energy Buildings).
RELaTED will provide an innovative concept of decentralized Ultra-Low Temperature (ULT) DH networks, which allow for the incorporation of low-grade heat sources with minimal constraints. Also, ULT DH reduce operational costs due to fewer heat losses, better energy performance of heat generation plants and extensive use of de-carbonized energy sources at low marginal costs.
The RELaTED ULT DH concept will be demonstrated in four complementary operation environments (new and existing DH, locations, climatic conditions, dimension…) in Denmark, Estonia, Serbia and Spain.

The benefits of the PV-Prosumers4Grid action will be therefore threefold:
•	To identify the necessary regulatory changes and the business opportunities for PV prosumers and grid operators
•	To further support the deployment PV systems for electricity generation with focus on physical and financial grid interactions
•	To provide PV Prosumers (households and industries) with competitive and sustainable electricity 
Innovative self-consumption and aggregation concepts and business models for PV generation are extremely needed nowadays. At the time being many EU Member States have drastically reduced measures to further support the development of the RES sector, even though several projects have clearly demonstrated the need to maintain the policies to support RES until when a consolidated competitiveness has been achieved. 
Such competetiveness for variable RES will depend on the ability of the existing or future electricity markets to provide them with adequate revenues, whatever the size of the plant.  
In addition, the variable aspect of PV doesn’t allow them by nature to bid on the market at chosen times, with a possible and already visible impact on the market prices. The consequence could be that under such conditions, their competitiveness will become more difficult to achieve unless the consumers could become more responsive to price signals and allow to displace the load. 
Moreover, the new state aid guidelines published in April 2014 by the European Commission are pushing for further integration of renewable sources into the electricity markets, which will require from RES to cope with market integration, more constraining grid codes and balancing regulations.",2501738.75,2501738.75,H2020-LCE-2017-RES-CSA,CSA,BSW - BUNDESVERBAND SOLARWIRTSCHAFT E.V.,DE,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN;EUROPEAN RENEWABLE ENERGIES FEDERATION-FEDERATION EUROPEENNE DES ENERGIES RENOUVELABLES;ICARES CONSULTING;UNION ESPANOLA FOTOVOLTAICA UNEF ASOCIACION;FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION;AMBIENTE ITALIA SRL;Laboratorio Nacional de Energia e Geologia I.P.;ECLAREON GMBH;FRONIUS INTERNATIONAL GMBH;ASSOCIACAO PORTUGUESA DAS EMPRESASDO SECTOR FOTOVOLTAICO;UNIVERSITEIT UTRECHT,AT;BE;ES;IT;PT;DE;NL,

Fast actions are required to decrease the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, value that has currently reaching 400 ppm. Among the technological possibilities that are on the table to reduce CO2 emissions, carbon capture and storage into geological deposits is one of the main strategies that is being applied. However, the final objective of this strategy is to remove CO2 without considering the enormous potential of this molecule as a source of carbon for the production of valuable compounds. Nature has developed an effective and equilibrated mechanism to concentrate CO2 and fixate the inorganic carbon into organic material (e.g., glucose) by means of enzymatic action. Mimicking Nature and take advantage of millions of years of evolution should be considered as a basic starting point in the development of smart and highly effective processes. In addition, the use of amino-acid salts for CO2 capture is envisaged as a potential approach to recover CO2 in the form of (bi)carbonates. 
The project CO2LIFE presents the overall objective of developing a chemical process that converts carbon dioxide into valuable molecules using membrane technology. The strategy followed in this project is two-fold: i) CO2 membrane-based absorption-crystallization process on basis of using amino-acid salts, and ii) CO2 conversion into glucose or salts by using enzymes as catalysts supported on or retained by membranes. The final product, i.e. (bi)carbonates or glucose, has a large interest in the (bio)chemical industry, thus, new CO2 emissions are avoided and the carbon cycle is closed.

However, to this day, PV plants are not-controllable power sources, thus imposing limits on PV penetration due to technical restrictions.

The PVCI project will investigate these limitations and will provide solutions through a coordinated PV control strategy for combined frequency and voltage regulation. The two main objectives are: (a) development of a smart inverter control scheme to provide ancillary services to the grid, and (b) derivation of an enhanced network management strategy to coordinate PV plants and other network equipment for smooth and optimal grid operation. This is a holistic approach to the problem, simultaneously addressing frequency and voltage regulation, as opposed to the research made so far which treats these issues separately.

The research is very timely, as the leading PV deployment faces stagnation and several European countries have already reached their upper limits in PV penetration. This project is aligned with the European strategy to be more resource efficient and less energy-dependent on other countries.

The Researcher obtained very recently his PhD degree on PV modeling and control, and wishes to enhance his portfolio on the fields of distributed generation and power systems.

Due to the increasing population and scarce usable space on land, there is an increasing need for sustainable food and renewable energy from the ocean. In the future these will be supplied more and more by fish- and seaweed farms and ocean energy(floating) wind turbines. There are also geographical locations where additional housing or logistic hubs are needed. All these developments need a flexible and scalable concept that can support a multitude of activities at sea.
Space@Sea consists of a group of companies, research institutes and universities that will develop a modular concept for multi-use platforms. Standardised floaters that can be produced at low cost will form the basis. The approach will reduce the cost through standardisation in a similar way that containers reduced the cost of transport in the past.
Each floater can support a different function, such as: housing, renewable energy hub, aquafarming (seaweed, algae and fish farms) and logistics equipment. By combining the applications in different ways, Space@Sea will form islands according to the specifications for the location and function at hand. Three specific islands will be validated and demonstrated as part of Space@Sea: An energy hub in the North Sea, aquaculture in the Mediterranean and a floating logistics hub in the Black Sea.
To develop a safe and economically viable floating island, a floater need to be developed that can meet the requirements of the various applications and environmental conditions. At the same time these requirements will be brought together into a standardized design. Technology developments are required for the floater, the shared mooring system, coupling between the floaters and application specific developments.

Increasingly, modern technology is addressing problems where fluid transport takes place in sub-micron sized channels, or in pores. The physical laws of transport in such channels are qualitatively different from those that determine bulk flow; they are poorly understood and, importantly, barely exploited.  The aim of the proposed research is to lay the basis for an entire novel technology where thermal gradients and concentration gradients along nano-sized channels are harnessed to drive devices that have no equivalent on the macroscopic scale.  
Such gradient-driven surface flows  offer a huge scope for fundamental advances with very significant technological implications. We envisage breakthroughs in the area of energy extraction from salinity gradients (`blue energy’), ultra-filtration and desalination, and the development of novel, highly sensitive protein-separation devices. This new approach will surpass the intrinsic limitations of current technologies. The expected huge improvement in efficiency will be a game changer and will break the current barriers in the development of technologies such as e.g osmotic energy harvesting.

All the  applications  share the same underlying science and can therefore be addressed by the proposal team.  We will engage with industrial partners inside the team and with new partners that we will approach through our Knowledge Transfer Facilitator, to translate basic science into proofs-of-principle, pilot plants and, subsequently, full scale applications.

Yet, due to slow responses, many biological communities are lagging behind warming of the macroclimate (the climate of a large geographic region). The buffering of microclimates near the ground measured in localized areas, arising from terrain features such as vegetation and topography, can explain why many species are lagging behind macroclimate warming. However, almost all studies ignore the effects of microclimatic buffering and key uncertainties still exist about this mechanism. Microclimates are particularly evident in forests, where understorey habitats are buffered by overstorey trees. In temperate forests, the understorey contains the vast majority of plant diversity and plays an essential role in driving ecosystem processes.

The overall goal of FORMICA (FORest MICroclimate Assessment) is to quantify and understand the role of microclimatic buffering in modulating forest understorey plant responses to macroclimate warming. We will perform the best assessment to date of the effects of microclimates on plants by applying microtemperature loggers, experimental heating, fluorescent tubes and a large-scale transplant experiment in temperate forests across Europe. For the first time, plant data from the individual to ecosystem level will be related to microclimate along wide temperature gradients and forest management regimes. The empirical results will then be integrated in cutting-edge demographic distribution models to forecast plant diversity in temperate forests as macroclimate warms.

FORMICA will provide the first integrative study on microclimatic buffering of macroclimate warming in forests. Interdisciplinary concepts and methods will be applied, including from climatology, forestry and ecology.  FORMICA will reshape our current understanding of the impacts of climate change on forests and help land managers and policy makers to develop urgently needed adaptation strategies.",1498469.0,1498469.0,ERC-2017-STG,ERC-STG,UNIVERSITEIT GENT,BE,,,

However, it may be extended equally well to new residential and commercial buildings.
The system’s central core consists of a cloud-based computing platform which concentrates managing and operational logic to support decision-making in planning and construction as well as energy performance enhancement and monitoring during operation. The Toolkit provide energy saving, energy fluxes optimization, data exchange, stakeholders’ active involvement and Smart Grid interactivity.
Interoperable building technologies and installations are also integrated in the toolkit: envelope solutions (thermal insulation and windows) ensure a reduction of thermal loads, while technical systems (BEMS, BIPV, heat pump, fan-coils, power controller, storage systems) ensure energy efficiency and RES exploitation.

This is achieved by exploiting the synergies of a technology portfolio in the areas of: user-centric design with enhanced passenger comfort and safety, lightweight materials with enhanced thermal insulation properties, and optimised vehicle energy management.
The developed technologies will be integrated and qualified in a Honda B-segment electric vehicle validator. Among these, a novel refrigerant for cooling, combined with an energy-saving heat pump operation for heating, advanced thermal storages based on phase change materials, powerfilms for infrared radiative heating, and materials for enhanced thermal insulation of the cabin will be investigated. Further focus is put on lightweight glasses and composites for windows and chassis, as well as light metal aluminium or magnesium seat components. Optimized energy management strategies, such as pre-conditioning and zonal cooling/heating the passenger cabin as well as user-centric designed cooling/heating modules will further enhance the thermal performance of the vehicle. These strategies will be seamlessly implemented in an intelligent vehicle control unit enhanced by a novel Human Machine Interface, which, beyond being intuitive and user friendly, will also consider diverse users’ needs, accounting for gender and ageing society aspects.
The objective of QUIET is to reduce the energy needed for cooling and heating the cabin of an electric vehicle under different driving conditions, by at least 30 % compared to the Honda baseline 2017. Additionally, a weight reduction of about 20 % of vehicle components (e.g. doors, windshields, seats, heating and air conditioning) is also addressed.

Over half of new generation capacity in 2014 came from renewable energy. Individual, community and co-operative decentralized renewable energy (DRE) producers are capturing a growing share of energy markets (e.g. solar, wind, biomass). As their market share increases, DRE producers are becoming increasingly effective political actors. The traditional political privilege enjoyed by incumbent industries is challenged by these DRE actors as they shift control over jobs, economic growth and energy supplies. Political struggles between competing interests are increasing. However, the nature and extent of these power shifts (e.g. changes in access to policy makers, media influence), and their consequences for political systems and their outcomes (e.g. contested carbon targets, renewable energy subsidies) are poorly understood. This project addresses how and why DRE transitions are shifting political power relations, and the consequences of those shifts for political systems and outcomes. Using an interdisciplinary approach grounded in theory on sustainability transitions (i.e. Multi-Level Perspective), power (e.g. Lukes, Foucault) and institutions (i.e. institutional logics) the project will: (1) examine the conditions leading to shifts in political power by analyzing existing political power relations in regimes where DRE transitions are expected, occurring, or stalled; (2) assess the mechanisms by which political power shifts resulting from these DRE transitions are occurring; and, (3) identify the consequences of DRE-related political power shifts for political systems and their outcomes. Objectives will be explored using a global survey of 20 DRE regimes. Survey insights will be expanded in 5 international comparative cases.

Building on the state-of-the-art, CORUS will develop an operational concept enabling safe interaction between all airspace users in VLL considering contingencies and societal issues. Specifically CORUS will:
1. Establish a CONOPS for nominal situations, developing use cases for major scenarios
2. Address drones operations in the vicinity of airfields and controlled airspace and for transfer between controlled and non-controlled airspaces.
3. Describe how losses of safety in non-nominal drone situations can be minimized.
4. Examine non-aviation aspects, identifying key issues for society and offering solutions to ease social acceptance
5. Identify necessary technical developments, quantifying the level of safety and performance required

We have developed W2W –water to water- the first water desalination system fully off-grid and fully powered by renewable energies (wind & solar).
Within Europe, especially western and Southern regions suffer water shortages, which will become increasingly more frequent and severe due to water demands and climate change. 
Seawater represents an inexhaustible resource to produce drinking water. However, conventional desalination techniques are extremely energy-intensive that are designed for large-scale capacity plants. Its cost is prohibitive for zones than require a smaller production of water. W2W is an innovative option for obtaining safe drinking water from seawater, brackish water or even polluted groundwater.  
The system consists of a wind turbine connected to a heat pump that is powered by solar energy when wind flow decreases, thus 100% powered by renewable energies. The thermal energy created by the power unit is used in a state-of-the-art membrane distillation system to evaporate and then condense feedwater from a water source to create fresh, pure water. 
A single unit of W2W can desalinate more than 95,000 litres of water a day, which can provide drinking water for more than 800 people without any grid connection.  Water is produced locally directly where it is needed without the need for long distribution nets and associated energy costs.  
Our system is targeted to coastal municipalities in the Mediterranean that need to increase their water purification capacity. Disaster relieve and emergency response operations can also benefit from W2W: it provides drinking water without the need of any energy/fuel supply, exactly the things that are normally lacking in such areas.

Indeed, the demand for upscaling the computational power requires even denser server farms, whose thermal management of dissipated heat with conventional air-based cooling is both becoming technically unfeasible, environmentally questionable and economically unbearable. Thus, power/cooling is currently the #1 Data Centre (DC) design criteria.
Asetek’s Direct-To-Chip liquid cooling solutions are based on the fact that water absorbs and conducts heat much more efficiently than air. This directly translates in computational performance gains, since the components can run at speed without overheating or undesired throttling thanks to efficient heat dissipation. Moreover, Asetek’s data centre-oriented liquid cooling solution – RackCDU D2C™, a disruptive server chassis with an integrated liquid piping that transfers heat from CPUs/GPUs and memory modules to flowing liquid through radiator interfaces – can even enable the dissipated heat to be recovered for building heating, thus reducing the cooling energy bill of data centres up to 70%. In addition, these significant savings are delivered while requiring only a 6% CAPEX increase for new DCs and having a <1 year investment payback time – thus providing a much stronger value proposition than direct competitors.
The key market barrier to generate strong pull for RackCDU in the $5bn market of Data Centre cooling technologies is the very conservative and risk-averse mind-set of data centre managers. Thus, the core activities of the project primarily focus on large scale showcasing of RackCDU, which will enable Asetek to thoroughly anchor its communication around a fact-based strategy . This will propel our SME growth over the next decade, posing a potential business revenue stream allowing to graduate from its SME status within the first 5-years post-project.

In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than €60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector.

Substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be achieved by large scale deployment of renewable energy sources, including in particular the most abundant energy sources, wind and sun. Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap. As there are no large scale storage solutions available yet, other backup capacities are needed. The installed fossil capacity is large enough to provide this back-up power. However, the plants were designed for baseload operation, which results in increased wear and costs through cyclic operation and unnecessarily high emissions in the start-up phase.
Providing technology upgrades to retrofit the installed power plants to enable flexible operation without penalties on life, cost and emissions is an opportunity to quickly provide the necessary backup capacity to keep the energy system stable and resilient and at the same time enabling higher renewable shares.
TURBO-REFLEX will follow this approach and has selected technologies for retrofitting critical parts of thermal power plants which have already seen experimental proof-of-concept and are expected to significantly contribute to flexible operation.

By the increase of DERs and without monitoring systems, it is difficult for DSOs to ensure the reliability and the quality of services while maintaining a limited cost for the grid infrastructure investments. A Smart Electricity Grid is an upgraded active electricity network including information and communication technologies, advanced control, IoT, etc. It can intelligently integrate the actions of ‘prosumers’ able to produce electricity as well as consume it. A smart grid ensures an efficient, sustainable electricity supply, with lower losses and greater reliability and security and solves the main problems associated with the integration onto the conventional distribution network of a great deal of variable and/or intermittent DERs. GridEye allows the rapid transition from the conventional low-voltage grid to a smart distribution grid. GridEye is a true network optimization platform, measuring, monitoring and controlling the low-voltage grid for an efficient integration of DERs. GridEye platform is made up of distributed inter-connected smart modules that measure network quantities and take expert actions to guarantee network power quality and optimization of energy flows.

However, this transition is far from complete, and further changes are essential to make our energy system ready to play its part in realising the climate goals set at COP21. At present, renewable energy sources are increasing their share of electricity generation. This is particularly the case for offshore wind energy. InnoDC's 14 participants prepare 15 early career researchers to play their role in the energy transition that will take place over the next 20-40 years.
The project focusses on the development of the electricity transmission system, targeting the connection of offshore wind, the integration of offshore wind with the existing power system (including the use of HVDC), and the operation of the future power system where large scale wind is connected to a hybrid AC and DC power system.
Technological development for offshore wind is ongoing. This research project focusses on the models and methodologies for the integration of these new technologies (e.g. offshore wind turbines, VSC HVDC converters, long AC cables) into the power system. 
Challenges in these areas will be addressed in this project: firstly, these new devices behave inherently differently to traditional power system components. Secondly, the multi-actor/intersectoral nature of these systems means that they have distinct elements and devices interfacing with each other, each with limited information of the overall system.
The project will train the researchers in developing prototype tools to aid the developers and users of these new energy systems.

However, one problem still limits the optimal and efficient use of biomass for energy and other applications: the varying biomass feedstock quality causes 5-10% of extra operating costs at a typical power plant. The quality fluctuation can be dealt with by optimising the feedstock mix and plant processes based on the feedstock quality. However, this is only possible when real-time information of the quality of each raw material load is available. The conventional quality measurement methods cannot provide such data.  

Prometec Tools has developed an automated solution, the Q-Robot, that renews the raw material quality management at biomass power plants and biorefineries. It eliminates the error caused by conventional sampling procedures and provides information of each biomass delivery before it is unloaded from the truck. Moreover, since it makes load-specific information available also to the feedstock supplier, Prometec’s solution enables a completely new level of intelligent biomass quality management across the whole supply chain. The solution benefits the end user (plant), the feedstock supplier as well as the consumer and the society at large by improving the resource and cost efficiency (and therefore also the sustainability) of biomass supply and use. 

Prometec aims at becoming the leading European service provider for feedstock quality management at biomass power plants, pulp mills and biorefineries - a global multi-billion-euro market. The novel solution is estimated to create 800 000 € of annual savings at an 800 GWh power plant and its expected payback time is less than 12 months. The net savings potential in Europe in 2020 is 0,8 B€.

UDO has been tested in two vehicles’ prototypes, one of a kick-bike and another of a bicycle, and has proven its very low energy consumption (1 Wh/km), big autonomy (up to 120 km) and usability.
54% of the worlds’ population lives in cities and almost half commute to work by car, generating 40% of CO2 emissions. Car user’s experience is far from being efficient as up to 101 hours in congestion can be wasted and € 10.000/year in costs can be spent. Commuting by bike is a great way to avoid traffic jam, contributes to a healthier city, increases the appeal of public transport and save money whilst exercising. However, current offerings (traditional and electric vehicles) presents drawbacks that still prevent commuters to switch. Nowadays solutions for cities’ sustainable mobility are bicycles (but the physical effort required and the need to shower afterwards still prevents many commuters) and electric bicycles (discouraged by many users as they feel dangerous, are heavy and have low autonomy as they must be charged every 15-40 km). As such, there is currently a gap between potential urban cyclists and the vehicle offering. UDO is the alternative that fill the gap for commuters to shift towards a healthier, more sustainable and safer way to travel to work.
The goal of UDO’s project is to bring our vehicles to a state of serial production and international commercialization.

Such is the requirement in farms, nurseries, greenhouses and vineyards, where movement space for vehicles is confined, the crop sensitive to green-house emissions and high towing capacity is necessary. The most important component to contribute to torque and speed is the transmission system (transaxle). Current transaxles fitted on electric vehicles are less efficient, have a cumbersome design, consume more electrical energy, have reduced battery operational time and are more expensive, thereby costing farmers up to 50% more in operational expenses. 
TX3 aims at realizing an efficient 'Third Generation Transmission Axle' presenting flexibility in torque and speed and a compact design to suit the needs of the sector. We will combine the best technologies in mechanical gear ratios, mechanical differential locking and transaxle modularisation, to produce a novel design that will completely revolutionise transaxles for the agricultural electric vehicle sector. The high efficiency of the transmission will allow for enhanced vehicle autonomy with higher load capacity and longer battery life expectancy on a single charge. The application of TX3 is expected to have ripple benefits across Europe and globally, maximising the productive running time, thereby increasing productivity for farmers.

Commercialization of AWE will contribute in reaching the committed share of 27% renewables in Europe by 2030. 

The wind energy is stronger and more steady at higher altitudes, which means that AWE can be installed in locations where wind turbines are not viable. AWE can also be used in locations where conventional wind turbines have a negative impact on the visual environment. Contrary to conventional wind turbines, kite turbines have a very small footprint on the ground and are hardly visible up in the air. A complete construction of a kite turbine requires only 10% the mass of a conventional wind turbine and yearly operational hours can double due to high altitude operation.

The Norwegian based AWE producer, Kitemill has demonstrated autonomous operation of their 30-kW kite turbine in operational environment at their test site. 

Their unique features for succeeding in commercialization of kite turbines:
 • The first airborne wind energy supplier to feature vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) solution. The advantage with a    VTOL system is a minimized landing platform since it only need to be as wide as the wingspan of the kite. 
• Customer secured for a demo park consisting of five 30-kW kite turbines. 
• The first company to have obtained permanent operating license in designated areas issued by National Aviation Authorities.
• Commercialization strategy will start with the 30-kW kite turbine to obtain a high number of operational hours at a smaller scale, which will reduce risk for the customers when introducing a new energy technology.

Significantly, the recent development of microfluidic tools to study pore-scale phenomena under high pressure, opens new avenues to investigate such strategies. Thus, the strategic objective of this project is to develop and to use “Biological Geological Laboratories on a Chip - BioGLoCs” mimicking reservoir conditions in order to gain greater understanding in the mechanisms associated with the biogeological conversion process of CO2 to methane in CGS environment at pore scale. 
The specific objectives are: (1) to determine the experimental conditions for the development of competent micro-organisms (methanogens) and to establish the methane production rates depending on the operating parameters, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of a H2 in situ production strategy (required to sustain the methanogenesis process), (3) to investigate the full bioconversion process in 2D and 3D, (4) to demonstrate the process scaling from pore scale to liter scale and (5) to evaluate the overall process performance.

PHAs is potential substitute for conventional polymers, since they possess similar properties; respect to polylactic acid (the most widespread biobased/biodegradable material), PHAs show higher biodegradability and better functional properties and mechanical strength. 
However, applications of PHAs as food packaging materials are subjected to some limitations. PHA shows medium values of O2 and H2O transmittance while many the most critical factors for some foods (such dry products as bakeries) in relation to packaging are moisture uptake leading to loss of crispiness and oxidation of fats. 
For overcoming this limiting factor in PHA food applications, BioBarr aims to enhance PHA vapour and gas barrier properties through material functionalization.
In the first research line, the approach consists of the use of biodegradable materials with adequate properties to be compounded in multi-layer structures specific for the food product category to be packed, in order to optimize functional properties. The innovation consists of laminating PHA with PLA (polylactic acid).
The second challenging research line in BioBarr is surface treatments (nanoform metallization with AlOx or SiOx or metallization Aluminum process) of PHA films.
New materials will be validated on a restricted number of food products in the sector of bakery, representative of different shelf-life requirements and duration, with the purpose to increase shelf-life at least by 10%.

The requirements for sorting and segregation of polymer types within waste streams are intensifying - more stringent targets for recycling are forcing recyclers to segregate more difficult materials that they could formerly lose as scrap; increased volumes and high labour costs force the industry to reduce manual segregation and increase shredding; this requires more automation of sorting facilities; producer regulations increase the responsibility for the supply side to ensure identifiability of the materials they provide, through to the point of recycling.  Automated sorting operations are all based on Near Infra-Red spectroscopy, which can rapidly recognize the NIR signature of different polymers, and activate sorting equipment to segregate the polymer types.  NIR is the only technique that is fast enough, powerful enough and robust enough to be usable on a recycling line.  BUT the NIR technique fails to “see” black materials and some colours, because the carbon black pigment used also absorbs the NIR beam and prevents the reflection of the polymer’s characteristic spectrum back to the sensor.

The successful market application of the C2C-NewCap technology will mean more on-time deliveries, less fuel consumption, carbon emissions and air pollution and, ultimately, the end of jumper cables for trucks and buses.
C2CNewCap will also expand existing batteries lifespan and reduce the use of lead-acid batteries – which are hazardous and strongly pollutant",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,CHARGE2C-NEWCAP LDA,PT,,,

While a number of evolutionary improvements remain, the limits to thermal efficiency are becoming visible in terms of material constraints, NOx emissions and engine operability. The propulsive efficiency improvement potential is also small and constrained by transmission losses, nacelle and intake drag, engine weight and - for open-rotors - by noise and integration challenges. If the continuous increase in air travel is to become sustainable - as the ACARE 2020 and Flightpath 2050 goals require - then a revolutionary step change in aircraft technology is required.

Current aircraft/engine conceptual design methodologies are centered on the disciplines of aerodynamics, structures, and gas turbine performance. Key aspects of unconventional concepts - such as hybrid electric propulsion - are thus hard to capture within existing design tools.

TRADE proposes the integration of three new aspects into aircraft/engine conceptual design. First, an advanced structural model quantifies the impact of the installation of heavy equipment on the sizing of the aircraft structure. Second, refined on-board system models capture design and performance trades in electric power systems, gas turbines, and thermal management. Finally, an operational and mission model enables flight dynamic analyses and an assessment of handling qualities of diverging aircraft configurations. All improvements build on extensive model assets of the consortium members.

TRADE also delivers the integration of these new aspects into a conceptual design environment. The environment is suitable for the design of hybrid electric aircraft, and the consortium will apply it for configuration assessment and optimization at sub-system as well as whole-aircraft level.

GB vision is to take the final steps of commercial and technical development and product maturation towards the commercialization of CleanTechBlock (CTB) – a patented multifunctional sandwich-block based on the combination of two clay brick shells and foamed recycled glass. CTB’s advantages over bricks are compelling as the insulation, strength properties and construction price are similar and it offers: an overall increase in the living area (3-5%), a reduction in the overall house wall construction time (5x faster), while reducing maintenance requirements and transportation costs. It also contributes to the mitigation of environmental problems due to an increase of glass waste recycling, decrease of raw material (clay) and energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
CLEANTECHBLOCK2 project is expected to significantly enhance the profitability and competitiveness of GB, with an expected sales turnover of €67M and profits of €15M, 6 years after commercialization in the environmentally conscious construction segment (both residential and non-residential) of primary targeted markets – Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

The JETSCREEN objectives are to develop a screening and optimization platform, which integrates distributed design tools and generic experiments to assess the risks and benefits of alternative fuels, and to optimize alternative fuels for a maximum energy per kilogram of fuel and a reduction of pollutants emissions. As a step prior to the lengthy and costly approval process, screening uses low cost small scale experimental and model-based testing to predict the impact of fuel on selected engine and fuel system components. The methodology is based on deriving predictive tools which capture fuel composition’s effects on properties and sub-processes which have a direct impact on the performance of the fuel system and on the performance and emissions of the combustion system. Moreover, once the sequence of models exists to derive a relationship between fuel composition and sub-system performance then the reverse direction namely optimization is possible; for targeted performance or emission reductions can then be connected to a modification in the fuel formulation.

Unlike graphene, they possess an electronic band gap, enabling electrostatic confinement of electrons by using local gate electrodes, and therefore the creation of quantum dots (QD). QDs can be employed as the bases for spin qubits, possible building blocks of solid state quantum computers. Recent results of the host suggest that PTMCs may surpass other gapped 2D crystals in electron mobility, making possible the fabrication of QDs of exceptional quality. Moreover, their near-direct band gap enables their use in photovoltaic, photodetection and LED applications, and opens the way for interfacing photons with spin qubits, essential in long-distance communication between quantum computers. The proposed objectives entail the realization of electrostatic confinement to study state of the art PTMC QDs, and testing their viability as spin qubits via magnetoconductance measurements, and also the investigation of the electro-optical response of 2D heterostructures to address single photon to electron conversion in QDs, and possibilities towards application in communication, sensing and solar power conversion.

However, in the past few years, our team was able to develop a new technological configuration which divides the water splitting process into two phases : (1) an efficient electrochemical hydrogen production followed by a (2) spontaneous chemical oxygen production phase. By eliminating the inefficient electrochemical water oxidation reaction (OER) we achieve a significant increase in hydrogen production efficiency. Furthermore, reducing the danger of mixing hydrogen and oxygen eliminates the need for a membrane. A membrane-free system enables high pressure hydrogen production without the risk of gas mixture or membrane failure. Moreover, as the membrane failure is the main cause for malfunctions and offline times of alkaline and PEM electrolyzer, our technology improves system reliability and energy efficiency.

The purpose of this PoC is to further develop our basic lab prototype to demonstrate two  potential commercial applications:(1)Power to Gas (P2G) storage of renewable energy (demonstrating the ability to produce hydrogen with high efficiency and under high peaks) and (2) On-site hydrogen production for hydrogen refuelling stations (demonstrating purity and durability under high-pressure).

But oncogenic PVs are actually an unfortunate exception, as most PVs cause asymptomatic infections, and a few cause benign, wart-like lesions. Despite the efforts directed towards the understanding of the different clinical manifestations of infection, our knowledge on PV evolution remains fragmentary.
Oncogenic human PVs arose recently, after acquiring the E5, E6 and E7 genes. The integration of the E5 proto-oncogene in the ancestral AlphaPV genome allowed viruses to evade host immune response. Thereafter E6 and E7 acquired the ability to target essential tumor suppressor proteins, paving the way for carcinogenesis. Tracking the evolutionary history of the E5, E6 and E7 oncogenes will thus help understand the emergence of oncogenic human PVs. Regarding the deep roots of PVs, small DNA viruses may share a common ancestor as they encode proteins sharing similar functions and domains, but their evolutionary origin is still an enigma.
Here I propose to apply an evolutionary medicine approach, combining in silico and wet-lab approaches, to study key events that occurred during PV genome evolution. We will go back into history and study how and when certain PVs became oncogenic. We will resurrect the ancestral oncogenes, and experimentally test hypotheses about the function of the resurrected proteins in different environmental contexts. We will then generate a comprehensive scenario modelling the appearance of the modern PV genome and the emergence of the oncogenic phenotype of certain PVs. Finally we will explore the relationships between small DNA viruses and test whether they may have a common origin.

Present-day geophysical imaging of the deep mantle show anomalous chemical piles thought to originate from the beginnings of Earth. Recently, consensus has been reached that the chemical piles can impact, and be impacted by, plate tectonic processes. However, their interaction with mantle convection in a pre-plate tectonic early Earth is not well known.

In recent publications, I introduced di-block copolymer stars (or telechelic star polymers - TSPs) as novel self-assembling building blocks (“soft legos”), made of a soft core, decorated by a tunable number of functionalized regions or patches.

TSPs have a robust and flexible architecture and they possess the ability to self-assemble at different levels. At the single-molecule level, they first order as soft patchy colloids which serve then as “soft Lego” for the emergence of larger structures. At the supramolecular level of self-assembly, the soft colloids form complex crystal structures, such as for example diamond or cubic phases.

In this project I propose to investigate how such a novel class of highly versatile tunable building blocks can be applied to the self-assembly of novel and designable soft-materials and how to exploit their self- assembly properties for a controlled adsorption and release of nanomaterial into functionalised predetermined regions.

IIn contrast to many functionalised building blocks, telechelic star polymers particles are soft and they self-assemble into patchy structures, without the need for cumbersome synthesis techniques. The quantitative multiscale approach that will be used to carry out the theoretical part of this project, will allow a direct mapping to an experimental realization of the system.

A wide range of materials has been utilized in these devices, including among others: organic materials, inorganic quantum dots and hybrid perovskites. While the functionality, performance and device physics vary strongly from material to material and device to device, all OE devices depend on the energy levels of their individual components and the interaction of the electronic states at the various heterointerfaces. Lacking a method to map the energy levels in a device, energy level diagrams reported for most devices consist of a combination of individual energy levels for each material, which neglect interactions between the materials (that may cause interfacial dipoles and/or band bending) and do not represent the true energetic landscape.

As a matter of fact, it is a fundamental and necessary step to undertake in order to obtain sustainable growth and healthy marine waters.  

The overall objective of the project is developing a totally integrated underwater marine data system applied to the Environmental Monitoring market. AIMS is composed by a network of data collection tools (acoustic buoys, imagery systems, etc.), a Big Data platform for data storage and analysis, and flexible Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) for providing environmental information to users. It is a turnkey, a one-stop- shop solution associated to a complete range of services (consulting, training, assistance), thus covering the whole value chain. The strategy of AIMS allows solving main problems existing in the field of the environmental monitoring sector, namely: the segmentation of the market, the non-disclosure of scientific methods (black-box tools); inadequate IT resources available for dealing with growing volumes of data.  

This Phase I proposal mainly aims at accurately understanding the needs of real and potential clients, the degree of acceptance of various innovations introduced, understanding the gaps between rules and the capacity of clients to meet them, as well as the general market size. All in all, the solution applies to activities at a mature stage - like offshore oil and gas industry, at a growing stage, like offshore wind energy- and at a pre-development stage - like ocean renewable energy (tidal stream, OTEC-ocean thermal energy). These markets, together with relevant actors will be investigated further thanks to the feasibility study.

Our goal is to develop this totally new, environment-friendly, cost-competitive, scalable, water-based electrical energy storage system from TRL3 to TRL5.

Our objectives are:
1. to establish and extend the potential of BAoBaB to become a reliable and environmentally friendly way of storing (renewable) electricity at kWh-MWh scale for application at user premises or at substation level.
2. to understand and enhance mass transfer in round-trip conversion techniques and hence to improve the energy conversion efficiencies of the BAoBaB system, aiming an efficiency >80% and >10 times higher energy density than in Pumped Hydropower Storage. 
3. to validate under accepted utility use conditions an automatically operated BAoBaB system (with corresponding battery management) at a scale of 1 kW power and 7 kWh energy storage.
4. To pave the road for cost competitive energy storage with attention to life-cycle cost and performance, aiming at <0.05 €/kWh/cycle.

Currently the most dynamic market is in low flying remotely piloted and autonomous aerial vehicles. In 2016 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published three different categories of such drones: an open category, a specific category and a certified category. The MoNIfly project (Mobile-Network Infrastructure for Cooperative Surveillance of Low Flying Drones) targets the open and specific categories by proposing a drone traffic management system based on mobile network infrastructure. The main challenge will be the acceptance of low flying devices by the general public. Therefore innovative solutions must be found, developed and demonstrated to allow safe and society friendly as well as aviation-harmonized drone operations. The MoNIfly concept will enable applications with virtual barriers (so-called geo fence applications) that use static databases as well as high-dynamic update rates to support moving vehicles. This means that the risk of collisions of drones with static obstacles but also other drones or aircraft/helicopters will be greatly reduced. Additionally this concept will allow protection of privacy sensitive areas like private houses/gardens or even scenes of an accident or incident. Another area of operation could be the TV market where during sports events the target of interest (e.g. downhill skier or car racer) would be protected by a fast moving geo-fenced area.

Solar cells system is a promising renewable energy technology that converts sunlight to electricity. Today, crystalline silicon exhibits high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and dominates the solar panel industry. The problem of silicon solar cells is that it suffers from high production cost due to tedious processing condition. Recently, organic-lead-halide perovskites have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar cell devices, and the PCE is up to 22.6% over the past few years. In spite of high efficiency, the presence of toxic lead (Pb) will become problematic in the future for widespread deployment of this technology. It is prospective to replace Pb with less toxic tin (Sn). However, the poor stability (the easily oxidization of Sn2\ to Sn4\ by O2) and low efficiency are two major issues of Sn-based perovskites. This proposal targets air-stable, high efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells by developing new Sn-based perovskites and electron transporting layer to match the band energy of perovskites. The expected fruits of the project will contribute to European excellence and competiveness in renewable energy field. The successful transfer of the results will promote economic growth and job supplies. In addition to the scientific objectives, the proposal will help the fellow to new acquire knowledge and reinforce his quality as an independent researcher, such as creativity, independent thinking, leadership and transfer qualities, which are critical for the fellow to secure a long-term position in a European university/institution, and eventually become a world renowned expert in the energy research field.",185857.2,185857.2,H2020-MSCA-IF-2016,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,LINKOPINGS UNIVERSITET,SE,,,

They are too expensive and not efficient. Organising devices in arrays is a solution where adjacent devices share an anchor. It reduces the total number of anchors necessary and the overall cost. In turn the loading applied to an anchor is a complex combination of horizontal and uplift cyclic loads. Screw anchors are piles which are fitted with one or several helices at their end. They are installed into the soil by applying a torque and are assumed to have an excellent resistance against uplifting.
The objective of this work is to study the fundamental behaviour of screw anchors upon complex loading in sand. A unique database of physical modelling tests (using cutting edge centrifuge apparatus) representative of small arrays of devices will be developed. In particular the tests will assess their uplift capacity after low level cyclic loading (fatigue behaviour). Numerical simulations, validated against experimental results, will provide additional information. Finally a new design methodology taking into account multi-directional and fatigue loading will be derived. This comprehensive topic has never been investigated before in sand.
The University of Dundee offers cutting edge centrifuge facilities and has an outstanding experience in physical modelling. A designed experimental set-up is able to install screw piles in flight and apply a multi-directional loading. I will build on my strong background in numerical modelling to carry out the numerical part of the project.
EU targets the ambitious objective to derive 20% of its electricity production from renewable sources by 2020. The energy revolution has just started and should generate many jobs and investments in Europe. This project will clear technical and economical hurdles associated with anchoring. It will improve competitiveness and leadership of EU on the renewable energy market.",195454.8,195454.8,H2020-MSCA-IF-2016,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE,UK,,,

They are excluded from decision-making, and are vulnerable to the sexual exploitation, alcoholism and conflict associated with this extractive industry. However, the scientific literature on the impacts of logging on women’s well-being is fragmented, and the subject receives little attention from policy and industry. This project aims to address this gap by: 1) publishing 3 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact, open-access journals on the gendered impacts of logging in Solomon Islands, based on an innovative combination of ethnographic and quantitative research methods; 2) compiling case studies on women in logging concessions in a special issue of the journal of the European Tropical Forest Research Network; 3) developing a methodological toolkit for the systematic assessment of women’s well-being in forest concessions. The project results will be further communicated to professional and lay-audiences through oral presentations, policy briefs, newsletters, a website and on-line articles.

This research and training project will consist of an 18-month secondment period at the CGIAR-Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR, Indonesia), and a 12-month return phase at the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology of Leiden University (CAOS-LU, The Netherlands). As part of the Global Fellowship the applicant will undergo thorough training in the field of gender analysis in forest management through the CGIAR Gender Research and Integrated Training Sessions at the PennState College of Agricultural Sciences. She will further acquire science communication skills through CIFORs outreach office.

This cost-effective coating technology – called nanoHPcs – solves wear and corrosion problems in critical components of plastics extrusion machines. Today, plastics and fibre-reinforced plastics have become the first material of use in many sectors (construction, automotive, aviation, etc.), being in many cases lighter, cheaper, more resistant and recyclable than metal. This highly affects the production equipment, as for plastics extrusion, machines must cope with increasing production amounts and requirements. Even more challenging is the extrusion of waste materials and of plastics aggregates with abrasive metal, ceramic, glass and wooden particles. The challenge in this industry is to make recycled plastics as pricely attractive as raw plastics material. Since recycled plastic is much more abrasive, extrusion machines must not lose any performance through incorporating the recycled material. Compared to conventional coating methods, nanoHPcs can enhance the share of plastics recycling in the industry by at least 10%, displaying a fantastic price-performance ratio, a reduction of more than 50% of production costs of critical components and of up to 70% of coating manufacturing and finish processing costs.

Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) modules cannot always be placed under ideal circumstances due to restrictions arising from the building profile. Therefore, non-ideal orientation and inhomogeneous irradiation resulting from shadowing from obstacles will often create non-uniform illumination. This, in turn, creates current mismatch among the different PV modules as well as among the different cells each PV module is made of. This mismatch can cause a dramatic reduction of the overall PV module power. Since current PV module technologies, both standard and smart, are not able to efficiently and effectively face the mismatch issue in highly non-uniform applications such as BIPV, innovative PV module technologies are required.

The FiberEUse project aims at integrating in a holistic approach different innovation actions aimed at enhancing the profitability of composite recycling and reuse in value-added products.
The project is based on the realization of three macro use-cases, further detailed in eight demonstrators:
Use-case 1: Mechanical recycling of short GFRP and re-use in added-value customized applications, including furniture, sport and creative products. Emerging manufacturing technologies like UV-assisted 3D-printing and metallization by Physical Vapor Deposition will be used.
Use-case 2: Thermal recycling of long fibers (glass and carbon) and re-use in high-tech, high-resistance applications. The input product will be EoL wind turbine and aerospace components. The re-use of composites in automotive (aesthetical and structural components) and building will be demonstrated by applying controlled pyrolysis and custom remanufacturing. 
Use-case 3: Inspection, repair and remanufacturing for EoL CFRP products in high-tech applications. Adaptive design and manufacturing criteria will be implemented to allow for a complete circular economy demonstration in the automotive sector.

Indeed, each year 8,500,000 tons of such waste are incinerated or landfilled in Europe (the equivalent of almost 30 landfills every year), and over 30,000,000 tons in the world. AHP are mainly composed of a mix of natural fibres (cellulose) and polymers (PP/PE and superabsorbent polymer), valuable materials that currently don’t find a proper valorization. Within EMBRACED project, a first-of-its-kind multi-purpose integrated biorefinery will be established in order to valorize in a relevant environment scenario the cellulosic fractions obtained from AHP waste towards the production of bio-products of significant commercial interest, and – concurrently – high added-value co-products, such polyolefinic plastics and SAP (superabsorbent polymers). 
This innovative biorefinery model will involve all the main actors of the whole value chain, from AHP consumers and local population to waste management and logistic companies, leading AHP producers and bioprocess developers, as well as final products developers. In a view of circular economy, all the fractions obtained from the processed AHP waste will be reused through valorization into final products, and in particular the high-quality cellulosic fraction of AHP (ca. 1,275,000 ton/y in Europe), which has significant advantages vs. traditional 2nd generation lignocellulosic feedstocks in terms of homogeneity and downstream bioprocessing costs, will be converted and valorized in two parallel value chains, leading to the production of biobased building blocks, polymers and fertilizers.",17334553.75,10695211.13,H2020-BBI-JTI-2016,BBI-IA-DEMO,Fater S.p.A.,IT,"NOVAMONT SPA;FUNDACION CIRCE CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION DE RECURSOS Y CONSUMOS ENERGETICOS;EDIZIONI AMBIENTE SRL;BV RUBBERFABRIEK WITTENBURG;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;SAPONIA KEMIJSKA, PREHRAMBENA I FARMACEUTSKA INDUSTRIA D.D.;AEB EXPLOITATIE BV;CONTARINA SPA;FERTINAGRO BIOTECH SL;PROCTER & GAMBLE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SA;TERRACYCLE UK LTD;LEGAMBIENTE ASSOCIAZIONE ONLUS",IT;ES;NL;DE;HR;CH;UK,

However, this renewable energy comes at great environmental costs and development of large dams is now considered untenable in many Countries. While studies addressing the ecological implications of hydropower have mostly focused on large facilities, investigations on small hydropower (SHP) are scarcer. Yet, development of SHP is booming globally and in the Alps rising concerns about cumulative effects on riverine systems.
This project proposes a multi-disciplinary investigation to better quantify hydrological alterations from SHP and its effects on Alpine stream ecosystems. Combining field-experiments, surveys and innovative modelling of existing flow data-series, the project will: i) quantify the spatio-temporal scales of hydrologic alterations associated with SHP using integrated analytical tools and modelling approaches applied to long-term, spatially distributed data; ii) experimentally mimic water abstractions from SHP using semi-natural flumes to assess the response of aquatic invertebrates and the link between community assembly and ecosystem function applying the Price Equation partition; iii) quantify flow-ecology relationships and the cumulative effects of multiple SHPs using novel functional regression models with streams hydrographs. The results will provide new insights into the short- and long-term effects of SHP on Alpine streams, with practical implication for the sustainable use of water resources.
During the project, I will train intensively in methods and software to quantify and model alterations of river flow and habitat and in handling large datasets. I will exchange knowledge with modellers, engineers and freshwater ecologists and foster new collaborations, which will benefit my host organisation and myself.

This project innovative approach is based on the application for the first time of the blockchain technology to the green certificate generation process, to create a distributed system where each transaction is encrypted and stored locally in many individual computers. Any transaction needs to be approved by a great number of members before it is exported and verify by the whole system, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries, and therefore, the fraud cases.

Green certificates are created each time one megawatt-hour of renewable energy is generated and put on the grid. Unfortunately, no matter where the electricity is generated, once the electricity enters the grid it is impossible to distinguish where it came from or how was generated. Currently this system is facing the following challenges: Lack of credibility and traceability, and fraud issues. 

With our Green Energy Tracker (GET) we are contributing to maintain a trustable renewable energy market by providing a system that Increases the credibility by substituting trust for security and traceability, eliminate fraud, increases the market efficiency and opens the possibility for new certification markets.

These attractive properties arise from the electrostatic nature of the charge storage which results from ion adsorption in the electrode pores. Recently, it was demonstrated that ions can enter pores of sub-nanometer sizes leading to a huge increase of capacitance. This was an important breakthrough as the energy density of supercapacitors, relatively low compared to batteries, is what currently limits their application. 
The progress towards more powerful supercapacitors is limited by our incomplete understanding of the relation between their performance, in particular their capacitance and charging rate, and the complex structure of the porous carbon electrodes. To make progress we need a better fundamental understanding of the ion transport and electrolyte structure in the pores but we are lacking the experimental and theoretical methods to do so. 
The aim of SuPERPORES is to carry out a systematic multi-scale simulation study of supercapacitors. The use of combined molecular and mesoscopic simulations will allow us to calculate the capacitive and transport properties of a wide range of systems. Molecular simulations will be used to model ordered three-dimensional porous carbons. This will allow us to vary geometric descriptors, e.g. pore size and ion size, in a systematic way and obtain relevant microscopic information for the subsequent computational screening of porous carbons, achieved through very efficient lattice simulations. We will then be able to formulate design principles for a new, and much improved, generation of supercapacitors. The simulations will also provide other macroscopic properties, e.g. adsorption isotherms and pair distribution functions, which will be used to propose a new method to determine accurately the structure of disordered porous carbons.",1240318.0,1240318.0,ERC-2016-STG,ERC-STG,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS,FR,,,

In this case, the thin films are grown in a layer-by-layer fashion allowing sub-nanometer thickness control, low temperature depositions, good uniformity and superior step coverage on high specific surface area components compared to CVD and PVD.
These advantages of ALD over other thin film deposition processes have been conventionally applied mainly in semiconductor electronic industry on the preparation of layers of outstanding High-K dielectric materials. 
But, due to the advances in tool design and recipe development, the importance of ALD is rapidly expanding for producing innovative nanoscale materials.

The failures are caused by inaccuracies in either 1) the underlying protein structures, 2) the employed QM method or 3) the embedding method that describes electrostatic interactions between the protein environment and the active site (i.e. metal and its nearest ligands). The MetEmbed project addresses 1), 2) and 3) with hydrogenases and polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) as target enzymes. Hydrogenases mediate the reversible conversion of dihydrogen into hydride ions and protons, while PMOs have shown great potential for biofuel production. The overall objective is to investigate the reaction and spin-state energetics for key intermediates in the two proteins' catalytic cycles. To ensure that the underlying structures are accurate, extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tailored force fields and QM/MM methods will be employed. The adequacy of the QM methods will be ensured by using accurate, multireference QM methods that are known to be well-suited for transition metal systems. Two new multireference QM methods will be applied, namely a multiconfigurational density functional theory hybrid and the density matrix renormalization group method. These methods have high potential for metalloenzymes, but have until now only found little use in this area. To address the effect of the protein electrostatics, an accurate embedding scheme that, contrary to most QM/MM methods, includes the polarization of the environment will be used. The combination of 1) accurate structures, 2) accurate QM methods and 3) polarizable embedding schemes is unprecedented for metalloenzymes.

However, only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling, and plastic packaging with an economic value of €70-110 billion is lost annually to the economy after just a short use. The vast majority of plastic is still disposed of by incineration or landfill, with in excess of 8Mt leaking into the oceans each year. It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. 

Recycling Technologies Ltd. has developed a process that recycles end-of-life mixed plastic waste [MPW] into a commercially valuable hydrocarbon called Plaxx. The technology is capable of processing varied types of MPW. Plaxx produced by the process can be used as a substitute for Heavy Fuel Oil but with the advantage of being very low sulphur.

However, rigid food containers and items such as drinks cartons etc., use laminates of differing polymers. The widespread use of dyes, fillers and other additives, alongside contamination from the contents of the original packaging, presents challenges for our process. Currently, our process is designed to process MPW with low levels of contamination. Capability to process a higher level of contamination through our process opens up markets 2-3 times bigger than at present.

However, the lack of reprocessability and difficulty for repairing and recycling significantly increases the overall material cost and causes grave environmental concerns. Additionally, the vast majority of polymer matrices and fibres used in their manufacturing are non-renewable fossil-derived materials or require high amounts of energy for their production. 
Aiming at addressing those limitations by involving the European bio-based industry, ECOXY will develop innovative bio-based epoxy resins and fibre reinforcements to produce new sustainable and techno-economically competitive FRTCs by targeting advanced functionalities: reparability, reprocessability and recyclability (3R). The 3R functionalities will be achieved by using new resin formulations replacing commonly used curing agents by dynamic hardeners, which under certain operational makes possible to: 1) repair fibre/matrix delamination and matrix micro-cracks, 2) reprocess cured laminates could be reprocessed to create new 3D parts (impossible with traditional FRTCs), 3) mechanical and chemical recycling.

However, the available electrical power is known to be severely limited by the so-called Shockley-Queisser (SQ) photoconversion limit. The maximum efficiency for a single absorber is limited as photons with energy lower than the bandgap (BG) cannot be absorbed, and just an energy equivalent to the BG can be used for photons with higher energy than the BG, due to thermalization. Tandem cells have overcome this SQ limit upon exploiting complex and expensive configurations. Alternative approaches, even with higher potentiality, as Intermediate Bandgap Solar Cells (IBSCs) have not reached the expected performance mainly due to the limitations introduced by the monocrystalline matrix. The incorporation of quantum dots (QD) to create the IB produces layer strain and defects that limit the cell performance. No-LIMIT proposes to revamp IBSCs concept, using polycrystalline halide perovskites (HP) host matrix in order to take benefit from the strain relaxation at polycrystalline materials and from HP benign defect physics.

The newly introduced National Revolving Fund for Energy Efficiency and the Utility ESCO Fund will be part of the pool.  Pooling will facilitate the exploitation of innovative financing schemes.  Crowdfunding has been recently introduced in the Greek legislation and this tool will be carefully studied and applied.
PRODESA is the first of its kind effort in Greece and aims to significantly contribute to the Energy Performance Contracting take-off.  For this reason the project consortium has pooled together Key Actors such as the National Center for energy efficiency, the European Crowdfunding Network and entities with technical, financial and legal expertise.
Being a showcase project, it emphasizes on capacity building, replicability, dissemination and exploitation of results.

forest products, are few and far between. This reflects a general lack of investment in the forest sector of the country. An
example of this is that the last national forest census was carried out in 1992. Meanwhile, the economic crisis that has
plagued the country since 2008 has made matters worse, not only in terms of funds to study the sector but also in terms of
environmental outcomes. For instance, as a result of increasing poverty levels, many people have resorted to the use of
fuelwood to satisfy their energy needs. This may seem like a good thing, in light of the Renewables Directive's targets for
renewable energy adoption. In reality, the switch to fuelwood has led to a severe increase in illegal logging. Despite the
numerous and frequent media reports, scientific evidence of this is lacking.
The GREEN FORESEEN project has two main objectives: to study the consumption of fuelwood by households in Greece
and, by doing so, to lay down the foundations for the development of the first Greek Forest Sector Model (GFSM), which will
be a partial-equilibrium model of the forest sector. The first goal will be achieved by way of designing and carrying out a
survey of the fuelwood market in Greece, as well as by analysing national statistics on energy consumption. This will give
insights on all aspects of fuelwood demand and supply and will allow for the characterisation of the illegal logging problem. It
will also assist in the development of the GFSM, as fuelwood constitutes over 65% of total timber production in the country.
The ultimate goal of the GFSM will be to enhance forest management by simulating impacts of policy and market changes
on the sector. An intentional byproduct of the GFSM will be the generation of knowledge that can be utilised by other
models, such as the EC's European Forest Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN).",150932.1,150932.1,H2020-MSCA-IF-2016,MSCA-IF-EF-CAR,DIMOKRITIO PANEPISTIMIO THRAKIS,EL,,,

the energy of human steps or any other means of vibration. The units are compact and modularly connect together making
electronic contact without additional wiring by a powerline communication system which connects automatically during the
establishment.

Basing on these considerations, the power sector and the European Union will be the two key actors of this project. The
main tool adopted in this work will be WITCH, the integrated assessment model developed at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei
(FEEM).
The description of the power generation sector in WITCH is quite detailed, but needs to be integrated, especially as far as
the electric infrastructure downstream the power generation system is concerned. In the first half of the project, developed at
the outgoing host, the modeling of the electric sector will thus be completed and refined. In particular, four main aspects
need to be assessed: i) system integration (i.e. the issues related to the non-negligible penetration of intermittent renewables
in the grid), ii) electricity storage, iii) electrical grid, and iv) electricity trade.
In the second half of the project, developed at the return host, the improved WITCH model will be employed in scenario
assessment calculations. Firstly, the prospects in Europe of renewables, CCS and nuclear will be analysed. In particular,
attention will be focused not so much on the pure technology aspects, but rather on policy issues such as the role of
incentives in renewable diffusion, the slow CCS deployment, or the effects of the nuclear reactors ageing, or of their phaseout.
Secondly, the focus will move on assessing the role of these technologies (and the consequent evolution of the electric

Liquefied biogas (LBG) is an environmentally sustainable fuel. Livestock manure is also an excellent source of LBG, turning waste product into energy. However, currently, it is only possible to generate LBG through large scale plants. This means that it is not economically viable to utilize manure from small and medium sized farms, which makes up 40% of the total biogas production potential, as small, decentralized plants are currently not economically efficient. The major reason for this due to the lack of a commercially viable technology that can generate liquid biogas at a small scale. This means that less than 1% of the potential biogas production is being produced. 

Biofrigas Sweden AB has developed and piloted an effective, decentralised, small-scale and affordable, containerized energy plant that converts manure into 97% pure liquefied biogas (LBG) and separates the CO2 it contains. This has several advantages: 
-No need to transport sludge to LBG plant – the plant is onsite; 
-Biogas produced is in liquefied form that allows easy storage and transportation, reducing transport costs by 84%
-The container is a temporary and moveable structure that allows an innovative financing model which does not require farmers to invest in the plant, therefore speeding up market penetration.

Moreover, 25.8 M tonnes of plastics ended up in the rubbish, with 30.8% completing their life cycle in landfills. Suitable sites for landfill across Europe are running out and public concerns are increasing about the impact of landfill on the environment and health. Reducing the quantities of waste that ultimately ends up in landfill has become imperative in the EU (Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC) and represents a particularly difficult task to achieve. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the impact of waste and plastic production. However, some packaging items such as nets (e.g used to package potatoes, oranges) are not suitable to be treated in recycling facilities as they are difficult to be cut and get entangled in the sorting equipment ending up as waste in landfills. One possible solution is the development of biodegradable and compostable materials that could be processed through extrusion melt spinning (EMS) to manufacture these nets. Some advances have been made in this area but the high price of the final packaging product make these alternatives economically unviable. Ecoplas, a spanish manufacturer of packaging nets has come up with a solution: Biopacknet. Biopacknet will be the first packaging net with improved physical characteristics that will be processed through conventional EMS, saving energy, quantity of material and above all at a competitive cost.

The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources is in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact. The aim of the SATH project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:3 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics.

Europe has been at the forefront of OLED-based research with companies having invested significantly in this technology. Although, OLEDs are already commercialized, the devices were fabricated by expensive vacuum. To achieve a truly cost-effective product, devices must be fabricated via solution processing. Thus, dendritic molecules represents a good alternative to small molecules and extensively high molecular weight polymers. Since dendrimer simultaneously possesses the advantages of polymers and small molecules, i.e. low crystallization trend, high purity, well-defined chemical structure, and excellent film-forming properties.

As a polymer chemist, this project has been inspired by my 4 years of experience in the field of heritage, in particular by experiencing the problems raised by the conservation of modern polymeric objects such as plastics.  The development of modern polymers during the 19th and 20th centuries has changed history and society and they are a part of our material heritage that it is essential to conserve for future generations.

 Appreciation of the role of autophagic pathways in the healthy and diseased brain continues to expand, as accumulating evidence indicates that proper regulation of autophagy is indispensable for neuronal integrity.  At the cellular level, several lines of evidence implicate autophagy in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. However, the synapse-specific substrates of autophagy remain elusive.  Similarly, the synaptic defects arising from autophagy impairment have never been thus far systematically addressed, yet they translate into severe behavioural deficiencies, such as compromised memory and cognition, pertinent to disorders of intellectual disability.
 The present proposal aims to determine how autophagy regulates synaptic plasticity and how its deregulation contributes to synaptic defects.  In particular, the objectives aim to: 1) Monitor and characterize the presence of the autophagic machinery in pre- and post-synaptic sites.  2) Identify autophagic substrates residing in synapses and whose turnover via autophagy determines synaptic plasticity.  3) Characterize the synaptic defects and ensuing behavioural deficits arising from impaired autophagy in the hippocampus. 4) Use C. elegans as a model system to address the evolutionary conservation of the synaptic role of autophagy and perform forward genetic screens to reveal novel regulators of autophagy in synapses.",1493750.0,1493750.0,ERC-2016-STG,ERC-STG,IDRYMA TECHNOLOGIAS KAI EREVNAS,EL,,,

A powerful way to achieve is this by using light, usually in the form of intense laser beams. However, modern advances in nanophotonics allow us to confine light modes so strongly that their effect on matter is felt even when no external fields are present. In this regime of “strong coupling” or “vacuum Rabi splitting”, the fundamental excitations of the coupled system are hybrid light-matter states which combine the properties of both constituents, so-called polaritons. Little attention has been paid to the fact that strong coupling can also affect internal structure, such as nuclear motion in molecules. First experimental indications for this effect have been found, but current theory cannot explain or predict such changes. We will thus develop theoretical methods that can treat the modification of molecular structure under strong coupling to confined light modes. This will require advances in the microscopic description of the molecules under strong coupling by explicitly including their rovibrational degrees of freedom, as well as techniques to incorporate the influence of these modes in the macroscopic setting of collective strong coupling. In order to achieve this, we will adapt well-known techniques from quantum chemistry and combine them with the concepts of polariton physics. We will investigate what level of control can be gained through this approach, and whether confined light modes could act as a “photonic catalyst” to control molecular dynamics without requiring an active ingredient. This could present a novel tool to control photochemical reactions that are of paramount importance in the biological mechanisms of vision and photosynthesis, and hold great interest for use in memories, photoswitching devices, light-driven actuators, or solar energy storage.

The fields have witnessed huge attention world-wide in recent years. In spite of advancement of the 2D materials, there is a lack of proper chemical functionalization. Therefore, apposite functionalization of TMDCs to tune electronic charge and spin properties beyond current systems is extremely crucial. Herein, we propose chemical functionalization of 2D-TMDCs by optical and electroactive functional terpyridyl (tpy) complexes. The functional terpyridyl complexes offer numerous advantages including (i) much more robustness due to strong metal-to-ligand back bonding through [dπ(M)-pπ(L)] as compared to the organic ligands, (ii) versatile coordination modes, (iii) tunable, and reversible redox properties, and (iv) switchable metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band in the visible region. Through this functionalization we will be able to: 
I-Modify 2D materials properties at different level depending on: (i) The strength of the new interaction between complex and 2D crystal, from soft modification by electrostatic interaction to strong modification by covalent one; and (ii) the degree of functionalization, from low coverage of the 2D crystal to highly packed coverage giving rise to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formation.
II-Tuning of the 2D crystals properties through the effect of light on the opto-electroactive complexes attached on them. The contribution from light-driven action to the electronic and magnetic properties will be deeply studied by the implementation of functionalized 2D-TMDCs into solid state devices, exploring their potential as logic gates and circuits or spintronic devices.",170121.6,170121.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2015,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITAT DE VALENCIA,ES,,,

In electric vehicle applications, costly mechanical gears such as planetary gears and reduction gears are needed to make the system operate with required speed, rpm and torque. Mechanical gearboxes are often vulnerable for erosion and damage. Quantum Electric has developed a modular electric motor system with an integrated digital gear.  The new electric motor is modular, compact and highly reliable and operates with high efficiency because of the innovative digital gear function. The digital gear extends motor efficiency up to several times comparing to traditional electric motors. All key components are modular which makes the motor easier to build, scale-up, customize and recycle.  The universal component architecture saves money in raw materials by 20%. The digital gearbox extends both battery lifetime and driving range of the electric vehicles and it is more reliable in operation. This new range extender technology is remarkable benefit for the whole EV industry. Quantum is entering the electric motor market which is valued at an estimated €27 billion and intends to licence their technology to car manufacturers, primarily for application in Light Duty Vehicles.

fact that only 19% of Europeans are bilingual the Public Transport needs to be innovative and leverage advances in Smart
City and Intelligent Transport System technologies to attract more citizens and foreigners to use the Public Transport and
facilitate freedom of mobility. To solve this problem we have created E-APIS, a smart, energy-autonomous, universal and
cost-effective dynamic passenger information system that removes all communication barriers and radically improves
freedom-of-movement in public transport across the EU Member States. The innovation lies in the integration of advanced
displays and mobile communications that are able to provide real-time information in any chosen language and low-power
technologies that allow 24/7 365 days of autonomous power through renewable energy sources.

Our solution provides a high economic impact to Transport Operators since it removes energy bills and installation costs and
gives them a new revenue stream. These qualities will shorten payback periods and make the investment sustainable and
profitable. We foresee that E-APIS will add over €10 Million to our annual revenue by 2023, increase our annual profits by

Current levels of usage and disposal generate several environmental problems with 74% of post-consumer plastic waste in Europe either incinerated or landfilled. Recent packaging directives from the EC have led to the imposition of challenging targets for recycling, and national governments are also examining new ways to discourage packaging waste. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is very recyclable and offers an opportunity to effectively and efficiently recapture and reuse the energy and resources of its raw materials. However, the high energy demand of current recycling processes renders it expensive and non-viable, making recycled PET (rPET) more expensive than virgin PET, resulting in low uptake in the lucrative food and beverages packaging industry. The main technical problem with current recycling is the high amount of energy consumed in the processes which limits the industrial profitability. Furthermore, existing technologies require additional purification systems to eliminate contaminates, further increasing cost and limiting supply. 

Gamma Meccanica is developing an alternative recycling process, using microwaves, to solve the current viability problems. Our technology will be the first in the world to address the profitability of the microwave technology in PET recycling by: Reducing the energy consumption of the process by up to 50%; Decontaminating the pellets in a single step process, providing a cleaning efficiency of >97% to attain pellet purity levels required by the FDA and EFSA; Reduced GHG emissions – saving about 2 tonnes of GHG for each tonne of rPET; Enabling rPET to be sold at a 15% cheaper price than virgin PET.

In this grant application we propose to study the role played by the different FGF ligands and receptors on autophagy regulation and to investigate the physiological relevance of these findings in the context of skeletal growth, homeostasis and maintenance. We will also investigate the intracellular machinery that links FGF signalling pathways to the regulation of autophagy. In addition, we generated preliminary data showing an impairment of autophagy in chondrocyte models of Achondroplasia (ACH) and Thanathoporic dysplasia, two skeletal disorders caused by mutations in FGFR3. We propose to study the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of FGFR3-related dwarfisms and explore the pharmacological modulation of autophagy as new therapeutic approach for achondroplasia. This application, which combines cell biology, mouse genetics and pharmacological approaches, has the potential to shed light on new mechanisms involved in organismal development and homeostasis, which could be targeted to treat bone and cartilage diseases.",1586430.0,1586430.0,ERC-2016-STG,ERC-STG,FONDAZIONE TELETHON,IT,,,

An energy-efficient heat and cold supply on the basis of renewable energy is one of the greatest challenges for our society.
The use of geothermal energy or solar thermal energy is a good solution for energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Both technologies could not yet establish well on the market because of the lack of inexpensive and efficient low-temperature heating systems (flow temperature 20-30°C). Established underfloor heatings are very expensive and only installed in new buildings. Therefore the market is looking for new and innovative renewable solutions, especially for the renovation.
In order to meet this demand we have developed a new surface heating and cooling element (FHKE/TRL6). Objective of the SME Phase 1 project is the implementation of a feasibility study. The new developed heating and cooling panel shall enable a large scale application of low-temperature heating systems. Our element is characterized by the following advantages and therefore perfectly fits the requirements of our target customers (e.g. municipal companies, public estate administration offices, private owners of houses):
-reduced heating costs by at least 20% 
-low costs per m²
-rapid mounting
-nearly no dust or dirt at renovation 
-small mass – easy handling, low transport costs
-efficient and even heat distribution
The current market volume for low-temperature heating system amounts to 500 – 1,000 million Euros. On the basis of imputed assumptions that within the next 15 years about 50% of the nearly 218 million European households need to be energetically redeveloped, this amounts to a market potential of at least 100 billion Euros related to sales.

Our understanding of how these extremely thin and flexible objects are processed in flow is however inadequate, and this is hindering progress towards true market applications. When processed in liquid environments to make nanocomposites, conductive coatings and energy storage devices, 2D nanomaterials tend to fold and break owing to strong shear forces produced by the mechanical agitation of the liquid. This can lead to poorly-oriented, crumpled sheets of small lateral size and therefore of low intrinsic value. Orientation is also a major issue, as ultra-flexible materials are difficult to extend and align.  In this project, I will develop nanoscale fluid-structure simulation techniques to capture with unprecedented resolution the unsteady deformation and fracture dynamics of single and multiple sheets in response to the complex hydrodynamic load produced by shearing flows. In addition, I will demonstrate via simulations new strategies to exploit capillary forces to structure 2D nanomaterials into 3D constructs of desired morphology. To guide the simulations and explore a wider parameter space than allowed in computations, I will develop conceptually new experiments on “scaled-up 2D nanomaterials”, macroscopic particles having the same dynamics as the nanoscopic ones. The simulations will include continuum treatments and atomistic details, and will be analysed within the theoretical framework of microhydrodynamics and non-linear solid mechanics.

Building on this, the CAPID project wants to develop ‘c-tokens’, that interact with these touchscreen and capacitive readers. C-tokens are thin and flexible, metal-oxide tags, integrated in paper and plastic products. The tags will send a dynamic capacitive signal into the reading devices.
C-tokens make it possible to identify and locate low cost and high volume products, like cards or labels, to the internet, just by putting them on a touchscreen. The number of different ID’s is very high and make it possible to create unique codes per product. The very small footprint (much smaller than NFC or QR) and low thickness make it possible to integrate them in a product as thin and flexible as a playing card. They are more secure than QR (can be copied) or NFC (can be read from distance) and they can detect the exact position of an object (important for board game applications).

Although computing servers are the foundations of the digital revolution, their current designs require 30-40% of the energy supplied to be dissipated in cooling. The remaining energy is used for computation, but their complex many-core designs produce very high operating temperatures. Thus, operating all the cores continuously at maximum performance levels results in system overheating and failures. This situation is limiting the benefits of technology scaling.

The COMPUSAPIEN proposal aims to completely revise the current computing server architecture. In particular, inspired by the mammalian brain, this proposal targets to design a disruptive three-dimensional (3D) computing server architecture that overcomes the prevailing worst-case power and cooling provisioning paradigm for servers. This new 3D server design champions a heterogeneous many-core architecture template with an integrated on-chip microfluidic fuel cell network for joint cooling delivery and power supply. Also, it will include a novel predictive controller based on holistic power-temperature models, which exploit the server software stack to achieve energy-scalable computing capabilities. Because of its integrated electronic-electrochemical architecture design, COMPUSAPIEN is clearly a high-risk high-reward proposal that will bring drastic energy savings with respect to current server design approaches, and will guarantee energy scalability in future server architectures.

INTEGRID is an algorithm-based optimisation software that provides a set of tools to solve strategic decision making problems, which arise during the design and planning of a smart power grid. Our solution simultaneously optimises various combinatorial decisions in the network, such as minimising the number of network devices to be deployed in a neighbourhood, reducing channel interference of interconnected networking devices or maximising geographical coverage of a region, by taking four fundamental strategic performance measures into account: Reliability, Security, Cost-effectiveness and Universality.

Greenrail Sleeper, patented in 122 countries, combines the advantages of concrete sleepers with the ones of composite sleepers. It is made of an inner core in concrete, covered by an elastic outer shell obtained from recycled plastic and ELT (End-of-Life Tyres), which reduces maintenance costs, vibrations and noise and allows to recover 35 tons of ELT and 35 tons of plastic from urban waste for each kilometer of line (1 km = 1670 sleepers). It is the sustainable substitute of pre-stressed concrete sleepers and it has a longer lifespan, estimated in 50 years from the first installation. Moreover, it is the only existing sleeper that can integrate sensors and systems for energy production and/or data transmission for safety and/or telecommunications. Besides the Greenrail Basic sleeper the company has planned further R&D for Greenrail Solar (a sleeper able to transform every km of line into a photovoltaic field producing from 150 kWh to 600 kWh), Greenrail LinkBox (a Greenrail Solar which also incorporates systems of data transmission for safety and telecommunications able to communicate with remote control rooms) and Greenrail Piezo (Greenrail Basic sleeper which incorporates piezoelectric systems and dynamometers that activate themselves at every train transition, producing energy able to power integrated systems for analysis and diagnostics of the railroad line).

Moreover, the average age of the walnut plantations and their need for thinnings imply that large quantities of small-diameter trees will be produced in the years to come. However, small-dimensioned European walnut logs are not demanded by wood industry because of the higher transformation costs and because of the competition of the American walnut.
WOODNat, focused on the whole walnut hardwood-chain, aims at increasing the use of quality walnut hardwood produced under sustainable management practices in planted forests of southern Europe, which implies adding value to the whole chain of the walnut hardwood market, involving the different stakeholders of the market. To help this approach, WOODNat will benefit from biotechnology, robotics, and the development of a mobile app. Thanks to WOODNat, walnut plant nurseries will improve characteristics of walnut plants in order to reach a higher standard in the market while increasing nursery productivity, and will keep after-sale contact with plantation managers to get feedback of the success of the walnut plants. A whole package of environmentally sustainable management practices, including sustainable innovative approaches to degrade by-products, will be implemented in walnut planted forests, not only in new plantations but also in many now abandoned or poorly-managed exploitations.

What’s worse, there are massive data, including metering data and measurement data,  structured or unstructured, making it challenging to exploit useful information. Hence, there is an urgent need to solve the research problem: how to coordinate multiple networks to reliably transmit data, and then manage ICT system resources to efficiently extract useful information for supporting smart grid applications?

Electric vehicles (EV) are emerging as the future of transport as they break the dependence on fossil fuels and offer significant advantages in terms of noise and local air pollution. However, uptake has been poor so far due to range anxiety. As a result, while 44% of drivers consider emissions & environmental friendliness as important factors when buying a car, only 5% would consider buying an electric car due to range concerns. 

Automotive manufacturers have addressed this issue through the installation of range extender engines. However, existing extenders tend to be too large with poor power density, limiting their use in small commercial and domestic vehicles where space is at a premium.. The clear business opportunity is to provide tier 1 automotive powertrain providers and OEMs with breakthrough innovation in EV range extender technology that significantly improves power density whilst providing  high efficiency, low emissions, low noise and low vibration to meet consumer needs.

This waste stream is expected to exponentially increase with an increasing number of 2G bioethanol plants being built, according to a report of the International Energy Agency.
FALCON aims to convert this lignin-rich industrial waste of 2G biofuel plants to higher value products, in particular shipping fuels, fuel additives and chemical building blocks. This would be the next consecutive step in turning waste to products, thus minimizing waste and simultaneously providing new alternatives for fossil resource based processes. The FALCON process is based on enzymatic and mild chemical conversion of the lignin waste stream, providing a more environmentally friendly approach to the production of fuels and chemical building blocks.
FALCON takes full advantage of the lessons learned over the last 150 years in the petrochemical industry with respect to design of the processes. This implies an initial treatment at the 2G bioethanol plant, converting the waste to a lignin oil that can be more easily transported and also directly used as a low sulphur shipping fuel. It will be further converted into fuel additives and chemical building blocks in centralized facilities.
To achieve this, FALCON has formed a consortium of industry (3), SME (4) and academics (2) covering the whole value chain from a 2G biofuel plant delivering the lignin waste to enzyme producers, chemists and process engineers to depolymerize the lignin to oil.

Nitride nanowires, tailored at the nanoscale, should overcome many of the challenges facing conventional planar nitride materials, and also add extraordinary new functionality to these materials. However, progress towards III–nitride nanowire devices has been hampered by the challenges in quantifying nanowire electrical properties using conventional contact-based measurements. Without reliable electrical transport data, it is extremely difficult to optimise nanowire growth and device design. This project aims to overcome this problem through an unconventional approach: advanced contact-free electrical measurements. Contact-free measurements, growth studies, and device studies will be cross-correlated to provide unprecedented insight into the growth mechanisms that govern nanowire electronic properties and ultimately dictate device performance. A key contact-free technique at the heart of this proposal is ultrafast terahertz conductivity spectroscopy: an advanced technique ideal for probing nanowire electrical properties. We will develop new methods to enable the full suite of contact-free (including terahertz, photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements) and contact-based measurements to be performed with high spatial resolution on the same nanowires. This will provide accurate, comprehensive and cross-correlated feedback to guide growth studies and expedite the targeted development of nanowires with specified functionality. We will apply this powerful approach to tailor nanowires as photoelectrodes for solar photoelectrochemical water splitting. This is an application for which nitride nanowires have outstanding, yet unfulfilled, potential.

The combination of these extraordinary properties makes of graphene a unique material. However, what really makes of graphene a huge promise under a macroeconomic perspective is that graphene in essence is carbon; one of the most
abundant elements in earth. This is why graphene has attracted a huge social, economic and industrial interest over the last years and this is why some sources predict that graphene will become the responsible of the next technological revolution.

Crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cells are since decades the most established photovoltaic technology. Their main advantages are long lifetime (>25 years), non-toxicity and the high abundance of Si. However, for full competitiveness with traditional sources of electricity, important new steps need to be taken to increase their performance. 
An innovative contacting scheme will be developed that eliminates the main loss mechanisms in c-Si solar cells arising from doped pn-junctions and the direct contact of metal with Si. The novel contacts will be broadband optically transparent, generate a highly passivating and carrier-selective interface to Si and will enable solar cells without doped pn-junctions. No cost-intensive patterning technique is required for the device fabrication and parasitic optical absorption, as present in Si heterojunction solar cells, will be minimized. The novel contacts consist of three layers: a 1-2 nm thick tunnelling SiO2 layer for chemical passivation of the Si surface, a wide-bandgap conductive metal oxide layer providing a specific energy band alignment, and a highly conductive transparent oxide (TCO) for carrier transport to external metal contacts and optimum light coupling into the solar cell device. The contacts will be used for the fabrication of Si solar cells which are devoid of doped pn-junctions and achieve both high open-circuit voltages and photo currents.

However, with renewable energy it is difficult to generate the same quantities of electricity that those produced by traditional fossil fuel generators and it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of supply because of the fact that the production relies on the weather for its source of power, solar collectors need clear skies and sunshine to receive photons and produce electricity, and wind turbines need wind to turn the blades. That is why energy storage is considered to be one of the primary means by which renewable energies can entirely replace fossil fuels. Traditionally, the energy is stored in an electrochemical way but batteries have some associated disadvantages. SONOLIS, an enterprise founded in late 2009 by a group of engineers and entrepreneurs, has developed an innovative Energy Storage System that combines, optimizes and improves the characteristics and performance of two basic technologies available on the market today, super capacitors and the last generation of lithium batteries, which is useful for several applications.

• Develop a governance model for cities based on value chain based partnerships.
• Develop decision support tools and assess the actual impact by use of Big Data.
• Ensure replication through the FORCE Academy aiming at enterprises, citizens and policy makers.
The eco-innovative solutions will be demonstrated across four cities (Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lisbon and Genoa) and using the four materials: 
Flexible plastics: Recycling and upgrade of 5,000 tonnes of flexible plastic from enterprises and private households will enable virgin material substitution, corresponding to preventing emissions of 12,500 tonnes of CO2. 
Metals: Citizens will be mobilised to reclaim an additional 2 kg/capita of WEEE (app. 3,600 tonnes). A communication campaign will reach 100,000 citizens and support at least five SME’s that repair damaged EEE devices so that 10-20% of the collected WEEE can be redistributed. 
Wood waste: additional 12,000 tonnes wood waste from urban and mountain areas will be collected. 8-10,000 tonnes of brushwood will be used for compost production, and 14-16,000 tonnes will be processed into wood particles.
Biowaste: around 7,000 tonnes of biowaste from the municipal mixed waste stream will be recovered: 3,000 tonnes coming from restaurants and hotels, and 4,000 tonnes coming from households.

This proposal focuses on SOFC stack cost reduction and quality improvement by replacing manual labour in all key parts of the stack manufacturing process with automated manufacturing and quality control. This will lead to stack cost of 1000 €/kW and create a further cost reduction potential down to 500 €/kW at mass production (2000 MW/year).

Applications are for instance hydrogen recovery from biomass fermentation, industrial pipelines, storage in underground caverns, and industrial waste gas streams.
The consortium consists of six partners including two universities, two research institutes, and two companies from five different countries. The overall budget totals 2 M€, with individual budgets between 220 and 500 T€.
This project will utilize an electrochemical hydrogen purification (EHP) system. EHP has proven to produce high purity hydrogen (5N) while maintaining low energy consumption because the purification and optional compression are electrochemical and isothermal processes. A low CAPEX for the EHP system is feasible due to the significant reductions of system costs that result from recent design improvements and market introductions of various electrochemical conversion systems such as hydrogen fuel cells. 
In detail, the purification process will be a two-step process. A catalyst-coated proton exchange membrane will be assisted by one selectively permeable polymer membrane. Standard catalysts are sensitive to impurities in the gas. Therefore, alternative anode catalysts for the EHP cell, an anti-poisoning strategy and an on board diagnostic system will be developed. The resulting MEMPHYS system will be multi-deployable for purification of a large variety of hydrogen sources.
A valuable feature of the MEMPHYS system is the simultaneous compression of the purified hydrogen up to 200 bar, facilitating the transport and storage of the purified hydrogen.

It is designed to measure column averaged CO2 concentrations for path lengths between 500 and 2000 m. A key advantage over other open-path techniques is that no retroreflector or separate active source is required for fence-line monitoring. It therefore fills a key operational gap in CO2 sensing technologies. In addition, through a laser replacement, the instrument can be used to measure also CH4, allowing both main carbon gas species to be quantified, and producing the name of this project, CarbSens. An affordable greenhouse gas (GHG) sensing platform with spatial coverage of 2000 m that fits into a backpack, can be mounted on an aircraft, car, mast or even a drone would have a wide variety of commercially attractive applications. These include efficient monitoring of CO2 leakage from CO2 storage sites or urban traffic, quantification of fugitive CH4 upon hydraulic fracturing (fracking), CH4 leakage from pipelines or biogas tanks, or refining regional GHG budgets for improved climate modeling. A system with the features of the CO2DIAL is not commercially available.

It is characterised by its very high efficiency compared to competing technologies. ReSOC enables to store renewable electricity when it is produced in excess or to convert it into a CO2-free transport fuel. Therefore, it is considered as a key technology to allow the broad penetration of renewable electricity into the European energy system.
Fragmented national research efforts are currently impeding quicker development and deployment of next-generation fuel cell and hydrogen technologies.

Thereof, 30% corresponding to 2.25 Mton/year can be collected as mono-stream AHP waste. However, current state of the art does not offer an economically viable solution for the recovery of raw materials from this stream. The underlying reason is that existing technology strongly depends on waste disposal gate fees and produces cellulose with a purity of typically 70-75%, which is only suitable for low grade application, e.g.as cardboard.

The main objective of the innovation project is to provide a technical solution for the recycling of high grade cellulose from AHP waste. The patented process is based on dissolving lignin with mild acids, thus upgrading the overall cellulose purity. Based on this solution a total of 360 kton of cellulose per year with a high degree of purity (> 92%) can be produced from the AHP waste. This high quality cellulose that can be used as paint additive or as chemical building block, could result in an economically viable operation without depending on gate fees.

These advancements when combined with a reduction in operational and maintenance requirements, will deliver significant reductions in capital and operational costs to achieve LCoE targets. OCTTIC will establish a robust industrial production platform and the associated supply chain to produce, assemble and deploy the turbines at scale to deliver LCoE targets and lead the development of the tidal energy market. The outputs of this project will be implemented immediately through the deployment of commercial tidal array projects in partnership with energy utilities to make significant contributions towards the decarbonisation of the European energy system and securing energy supply.",4271654.5,2990158.16,H2020-FTIPilot-2016-1,IA,COCKERILL MAINTENANCE & INGENIERIE,BE,JLMAG RARE EARTH CO (EUROPE) BV;NITRONICA LIMITED;OPENHYDRO GROUP LIMITED,NL;UK;IE,

Free Routing (FR) implementation represents a step towards a less fragmented European airspace foreseen by Single European Sky (SES) and provides the AUs with the possibility to fly their user preferred routes in accordance with their business needs or mission requirements.  FR will result in a seamless airspace enabling more efficient flight, a reduction in AU costs and will promote cheaper travel, increasing personal mobility and trade. In addition, implementing Free Routing Airspace (FRA) will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that currently contribute to global warming, thereby creating a greener airspace.

FR was addressed within the SESAR 1 programme but additional R&D activities are required to support the implementation of FRA in high and very high complexity airspace (The EU Regulation No 716/2014 mandates FRA above FL 310 from 1 January 2022) and also to extend this implementation below FL310 thereby allowing other AUs to benefit (The European Air Traffic Management Master Plan version 2015 identifies the need for R&D work to support the management of performance-based Free Routing in lower airspace)

The partners in PJ06 will validate both the benefit to AUs and the impact on ATM of this extension of FRA into complex airspace and lower vertical limits through modelling and Real Time Simulations.  The results will seek to provide evidence that FRA can be implemented, cost effectively, in all the SES airspace.

A consequence of this fragmentation, there is a negative impact on the cost in the provision of ATM service in Europe.  
A fundamental goal of the Single European Sky initiative is to “provide ATM services to airspace users at a cost of at least 50 % less”. 
The notion of Common Service aims to contribute to this goal. Common Services, defined as “a service that provides capability to consumers in the same way that they would otherwise need to provide themselves”, aims to mitigate this issue. Common Service approach follows a general principle within the Single European Sky initiative that encourages the harmonisation on the provision of common air navigation services wherever it is possible.
The main benefit of this approach is to deliver enhanced cost effectiveness to both the providing and consuming organisations and this could in turn potentially benefit the whole chain in the European air transportation business, making it more attractive as means of transport. Additionally, there could be a positive impact on other ATM performance areas as well, such as capacity, safety, flight efficiency, etc.
The providing organisations would benefit from economy of scale, while the consumers would not need to maintain and update proprietary solutions anymore. Overall, a better rationalisation of deployment should be expected.
Therefore this Common Service approach, if it is proved to be successful, could be viewed as an essential means to improve the overall cost effectiveness of the ATM business in Europe.

The project addresses three sectors, namely brick, pet care/feed and food industry. The results are however of major relevance for a number of other energy-intensive industries such as e.g. pulp and paper industry.
The DryFiciency consortium will elaborate technically and economically viable solutions for upgrading idle waste heat streams to process heat streams at higher temperature levels up to 180 °C. The key elements of the solution are three high temperature vapour compression heat pumps: two closed loop heat pump for air drying processes and one open loop heat pump for steam drying processes. The DryFiciency solution will be demonstrated under real production conditions in operational industrial drying processes in three leading European manufacturing companies from the pet food, food and brick industries. 
The potential of the technology demonstrated is to reduce the specific energy demand for drying and dehydration from 700-800 kWh per ton down to 200 kWh per ton of evaporated water. The energy switch from fossil fuels towards heat pump technology reduces the environmental impact considerably and offers at the same time a potential for energy savings of up to 60-80 %.

To improve their commercialization capacity, to compete with established power generation and to complement other renewable energy technologies, the performance of state-of-the-art OSCs needs to be further improved.

Our goals within SEPOMO – Spins in Efficient Photovoltaic devices based on Organic Molecules – are to bring the performance of OSCs forward by taking advantage of the so far unexplored degree of freedom of photogenerated species in organic materials, their spin. This challenging idea provides a unified platform for the excellent research to promote the world-wide position of Europe in the field of organic photovoltaics and electronics, and to train strongly motivated early stage researchers (ESRs) for a career in science and technology oriented industry that is rapidly growing. 

Our scientific objectives are to develop several novel routes to enhance the efficiency of OSC by understanding and exploiting the electronic spin interactions. This will allow us to address crucial bottlenecks in state-of-the-art OSCs: we will increase the quantum efficiency by reducing the dominant recombination losses and by enhancing the light harvesting and exciton generation, e.g. by means of internal upconversion of excited states.

Globally, data centres consume 3% of electricity (higher than the UK’s total consumption) and account for 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions. That gives them the same carbon footprint as the airline industry.
Although various energy efficiency gains are being made, the state of the art for data transmission within the data centre is inefficient. Optical Transceiver Modules (OTM), at 40Gbps and above, use power-hungry SiGe/BiCMOS technology in their Integrated Circuits. With a typical, large data centre containing at least 800,000 OTMs, they are responsible for around 8% of total energy use.
HiLight Semiconductor Ltd, a “Fabless Chip Company”, has developed MERCURY, an innovative Integrated Circuit chipset, pioneering the use of industry-standard CMOS technology to drive 100Gbps OTMs. With the use of standard CMOS, on 12' wafers, we are able to produce our Chipset for significantly less than our competitors' BiCMOS on 8' wafers. Together with our low power innovation, we expect to displace BiCMOS technology entirely over the next few years, just as has been seen previously, at lower datarates.
Meeting all industry standards, MERCURY achieves 100Gbps with less than half (57%) the power consumption of BiCMOS solutions. Based on European data centres' energy use and our expected global sales rates, by 2022, MERCURY will save 1.5 Billion kWh every year in Europe and 6 Billion kWh/year globally, helping meet the EC Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres.
This innovation project is designed to undertake vital prototyping, validation and demonstration activities to bring MERCURY to market-readiness.

The early implementation of Disaster Risk Reduction strategies strongly depends on the availability of reliable seasonal forecasts. But global, long-term climate forecasting models are used for seasonal prediction and they are very inaccurate as they have not been designed to this end. On the other hand, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is a challenge to grid operators, utilities and plant managers as they attempt to anticipate energy output. Reliable weather forecasts enabling an accurate prediction of energy generation in order to balance production and demand is key to boost the production of renewables and their smooth integration into the grid. Current weather forecasts used by this industry do not focus in predicting relevant variables for the energy sector (such as solar radiation). At geopredict we have put the most recent mathematical algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence into the task of revolutionising atmospheric forecasts and have created CLIMFOR, an intelligent, probabilistic, forecasting engine based on earth observation and in-situ data producing very reliable seasonal (medium-term: from few weeks up to a decade) forecasts with high spatial resolution (down to 1x1 km). With CLIMFOR we aim at improving the way we currently deal with the risks and opportunities arising from global change through climate negotiations, sustainable development policy, humanitarian aid and crisis management, as well as enabling a smooth integration of renewable energy sources into the grid.

DISC focuses on the only way to fully exploit the potential of silicon to its maximum: through the use of carrier selective junctions, i.e., contacts which allow charge carriers to be extracted without recombination.  Such contacts allow for simple device architecture as considered in DISC - non-patterned double-side contacted cells – which can be fabricated within a lean process flow, either by upgrading existing or within future production lines. In DISC, a unique consortium of experienced industrial actors will collaborate with a set of institutes with demonstrated record devices and worldwide exceptional experience in the R&D field of carrier selective contacts. DISC will target efficiencies >25.5% on large area cell and >22% at module level while demonstrating pilot manufacturing readiness at competitive costs. 
Together with a reduction of non-abundant material consumption (Ag, In), with an enhancement of the energy yield, with modern module design ensuring outstanding durability, DISC will provide the key elements for achieving in Europe very low Levelized Costs of Electricity between 0.04 – 0.07$/kWh (depending on the irradiation), with mid-term potential for further reduction, making solar one of the cheapest electricity source.

This requires the acceleration of development of new options that are emerging today, particularly, technologies that solve the key issue of energy storage. 
The next-CSP Project is a response to this need and addresses significant improvements in all three elements targeted by the LCE-07-2016 call related to concentrated solar power: heat transfer fluids, which can be used for direct thermal energy storage; the solar field; and high temperature receivers allowing for new cycles. The proposed fluidized particle-in-tube concept is a breakthrough innovation that opens the route to the development of a new generation of CSP plants allowing high efficiency new cycles (50% and more) and 20% improvement of CSP plant efficiency. 
The Next-CSP technology that cumulates the know-how acquired during the CSP2 FP7 EU project on the particle-in-tube technology can be rapidly cost-competitive and introduced in the market. A cost reduction by 38% is expected with respect to current CSP electricity cost. 
The project will demonstrate at industrial pilot scale (TRL5) the validity of the particle-in-tube concept atop the Themis facility solar tower. A 4-MWth tubular solar receiver able to heat particles up to 800°C will be constructed and tested as well as the rest of the loop: a two-tank particle heat storage and a particle-to-pressurized air heat exchanger coupled to a 1.2 MWel gas turbine. 
A commercial scale power plant (150 MWel) will also be designed on the basis of experimental and simulation results and associated costs assessed. The consortium includes 6 companies that will lead the development of the first worldwide demonstration of this innovative technology and pave the way for future commercial exploitation.",4947420.0,4947420.0,H2020-LCE-2016-RES-CCS-RIA,RIA,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS,FR,WHITTAKER ENGINEERING (STONEHAVEN) LIMITED;ELECTRICITE DE FRANCE;EUROPEAN POWDER AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY BVBA;EURONOVIA;SBP SONNE GMBH;Fundacion IMDEA Energia;INSTITUT NATIONAL POLYTECHNIQUE DE TOULOUSE;KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN;COMESSA SA,UK;FR;BE;DE;ES,

The waste is first transferred to an interim storage, where it remains for tens of years, till radioactivity and heat generation of the spent fuel is reduced to a level that allows its final disposal. It is generally accepted that the final waste will be disposed of in a deep geological repository. However, not a single country worldwide has an operational underground repository. In the design process of these repositories, simulation tools capable to model their long term behavior (hundreds of years) are required. However, such simulations are extremely challenging, due to the complicated nature of the physical phenomena of multiscale and multiphysics nature. Current numerical tools being used by some of the most advanced deep repository projects use CODE_BRIGHT (developed at UPC-CIMNE), a very rich code in terms of modelling capabilities, which benefits from 20 years of intensive validation against in-situ experiments. However, CODE_BRIGHT is a serial structured FORTRAN 90 code with very limited capabilities in terms of parallel performance. As a result, actual analyses of prototypical deep repositories require strong and not validated simplification assumptions, in order to reduce by some orders of magnitude the computational cost of the target simulations. In this project, we want to change the situation by developing extremely scalable simulation software for nuclear waste management in repositories.  The strategy is to port CODE_BRIGHT modelling capabilities to FEMPAR, the extremely scalable scientific computing code that resulted from the Starting Grant COMFUS. The result of this work will be a new software that (1) produces the same results as CODE_BRIGHT for a wide set of benchmark tests (to validate the code), and (2) with proven excellent scalability on hundreds of thousands of processors.",149250.0,149250.0,ERC-2016-PoC,ERC-POC,CENTRE INTERNACIONAL DE METODES NUMERICS EN ENGINYERIA,ES,,,

SafeClouds proposes a data-driven approach to achieve a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the system, where risks are pro-actively identified and mitigated in a continuous effort to enhance the already excellent European aviation safety records.

SafeClouds develops an innovative aviation safety data analysis approach. Currently each stakeholder owns different isolated datasets and data-sharing paradigms are rare. However, the combination of those datasets is critical in discovering unknown safety hazards and in understanding and defining a performance-based system safety concept. The new data-driven paradigm, capable of extracting safety intelligence in a fast, connected and inexpensive way requires the collaboration of aviation and IT entities sharing their raw datasets, tools, techniques and information.

SafeClouds high level objectives are:

- To define a user-requirement driven approach for data mining in aviation safety, covering several current safety challenges within airlines and runway operations.
- To develop novel data structures and safety intelligence representation. Given the complexity of the datasets, SafeClouds aims to solve their current challenges in data handling and knowledge discovery.
- To develop the proof of concept and validate in a laboratory the safety data analysis paradigms, at different levels: historical analysis, predictive analytics, automatic safety data monitoring and unknown hazards identification.
- To assemble a group of entities that encompasses the entire data-cycle for a unified, achievable vision for the future of safety analytics in Europe, including: users, data providers, data infrastructure researchers, operators and data scientists.",5576288.75,5576288.75,H2020-MG-2016-SingleStage-INEA,RIA,FUNDACION INSTITUTO DE INVESTIGACION INNAXIS,ES,"LINKOPINGS UNIVERSITET;VUELING AIRLINES SA;CENTRO DE REFERENCIA INVESTIGACION DESARROLLO E INNOVACION ATM, A.I.E.;IBERIA LINEAS AEREAS DE ESPANA SA OPERADORA;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;AGENCIA ESTATAL DE SEGURIDAD AEREA;AIR EUROPA LINEAS AEREAS SA;PEGASUS HAVA TASIMACILIGI ANONIM SIRKETI;LUFTFARTSVERKET;TADOREA INNOVATION SARL;NORWEGIAN AIR SHUTTLE ASA;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT",SE;ES;DE;BE;TR;FR;NO;NL,

However, the unit-cost of energy, that is retrieved from storages, is several times higher than the cost of energy consumed upon its output from RES. Therefore, there is a strong requirement on the optimisation of storage capacities deployed in the grid. This is especially true for the small energy sites such as DER and prosumers’ microgrids which are the segments, targeted by the SHAR-Q bottom-up concept.  

The principal objective of the SHAR-Q is to optimize the storage capacities deployed in the grid with the help of a peer-to-peer interoperability network that connects neighbourhooding RES\Storage ecosystems into a collaboration framework. Thus, the optimization of storage capacities can be achieved through their sharing among the participating actors. To get connected to the SHAR-Q network, an open interoperability gateway with semantic interface descriptors will be provided that will be based on the most adopted standards in the field. Moreover, the users will be provided with an ability to manage their contribution to the collaborative models on their own in a way that resembles the well-known social web portals (e.g. users can control with whom they wish to share specific storage capacities). 

The viability of the collaborative business models will be proven through added-value services, deployed over the SHAR-Q interoperability network, that will be demonstrated in 3 different pilots, targeting 3 different segments of end-users such as neighborhoods of distributed RES, coalitions of prosumers and locations with e-vehicle charging stations.

in 2014 has led to dramatic growth in electricity demand in many countries, to increasing electricity costs and brownouts. An
obvious possibility to counter this trend is to us the same energy for cooling that contributes to the cooling demand – solar
energy.

The objective of the SOcool Project is to use a concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPVT) system combined with chillers to
provide the most cost-efficient solar energy on the market in form of electricity, heat and cold. This shall help achieving the
2K target while enhancing the living standard in rather hot climates.

The SunOyster is a concentrating solar technology which can generate at the same time electricity and heat with a very high
efficiency. From serial production, this will result in very low electricity and heat costs. While the electricity can easily be
converted into other forms of energy and can be fed into the grid, the heat is more difficult to convert and has to be used
locally. A technically, micro-economically and macro-economically very good form of using the heat in hot climates is
converting it into cold for the cooling of buildings.

the Gulf region, India, South-East Asia, parts of China, Southern USA, parts of Middle and South America.

Despite the meteoric rise of the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (up to 20% in less than 5 years) they is still a substantial potential of improvement towards the theoretical efficiency limits. During the first research phase, most of the effort has been devoted to the development of deposition processes to produce the best crystalline thin films. APPEL has the ambition to initiate the second phase, in which fundamental understanding of the recombination losses in the perovskite and at heterojunctions with charge extraction layers will make possible to generate devices with efficiencies approaching the full potential of these semiconductors. A perfect solar cell should also be an excellent emitter, since 100% of the absorbed photons must recombine radiatively. Therefore the original approach APPEL is to target primarily light emission (photoluminescence and electroluminescence) to understand the factors governing the recombination losses in solar cells. From the understanding of the fundamental recombination mechanisms at the heterojunctions, I will demonstrate highly efficient devices with >23% power conversion efficiency.

Through ECOMOBI we plan to develop an innovative cost-effective eco-compound for the modification of bitumen. 

Bitumen has a wide range of uses, namely road construction. In order to confer it the necessary characteristics for this use, bitumen is currently modified through the use thermoplastic elastomers. However, these elastomers are expensive and confer low aging resistance, making them even less cost-effective. There is a need for bitumen modifiers that can offer the same quality properties as thermoplastic elastomers, but reducing the cost and increasing the lifespan of the end products.

On the other hand, Europe searches to promote solutions for the recycling of tyres. Across Europe, 5.7M tonnes of tyres are stockpiled in landfills, and recently the biggest tyre dump in Europe caught fire, with the subsequent damage to the environment and human health. However, currently only 17% of Europe's end of life tyres are recycled. 

ECOMOBI brings forward the development of a solution for bitumen modification using end of life tyres: RD PRENE. Through the commercialization of RD PRENE, Tecnofilm would have an annual revenue of 10M € in 2022. Its innovative formulation and extrusion process have managed to match the quality of thermoplastic elastomers. The increased elasticity of the bitumen modified with RD PRENE confers a 50% longer lifespan to end products than current alternatives, reducing the maintenance and replacement needs and derived costs. Moreover, due to the use of tyre powder in its composition, RD PRENE is 57-26% less expensive than current alternatives and can lead an average  bitumen production site to save 15% annually.

To this end, Pentagon will deliver two key technology assets: a highly efficient power-to-gas installation sized for coupling with typical district heating plants and a multi-vector multi-scale district energy management platform for the combined monitoring and management of all district energy carriers. The power-to-gas technology will achieve a 15 to 25% energy gain compared to state-of-the-art performances. The multi-vector multi-scale district energy management platform will achieve 15 to 20% more flexibility at district-level, allowing for a 25% increase of renewable penetration, by leveraging building and district power to heat conversion capabilities. These impacts will be thoroughly assessed through an iterative validation and demonstration roadmap that will start with lab-scale individual component testing, continue with a focused deployment in district-scale experimental facilities, and conclude with a wider simulation-based assessment at distribution grid level that will rely on a real smart district from a project partner.

Currently only 14%–30% of the energy from the fuel you put in a vehicle is used to move it down the road, depending on the drive cycle. The rest of the energy is lost to engine and driveline inefficiencies or used to power accessories.

There are several innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of the vehicles and reduce transport emissions such as regenerative braking systems, start-stop systems, KERS, and ERS. However, all these systems require fast electric energy storage.
Existing technologies for energy storage cannot meet the needs of the transport sector. The conventional technology uses batteries, but these are slow to charge and discharge energy, large and heavy. Ultracapacitors have been put forward as the solution, as they can charge and discharge quickly, however they are currently prohibitively expensive to allow them to be universally taken up across the wider transport sector.

We at Xerolutions have developed a new material, called CAPOWER, which reduces the cost of energy stored in ultracapacitors by over 20%. Compared with the conventional material, CAPOWER increases Power density, Energy density, Cyclability and reduces volume per unit of energy stored.
The cost efficiency of our material will allow the widespread adoption of the latest energy recovery systems to be introduced to all vehicles. 

The aim of the project is to scale up production of CAPOWER and demonstrate its effectiveness to T2 suppliers to kick start its take up in the market, and to thereby facilitate the widespread introduction of the energy efficient technologies. This will in turn reduce emissions and fuel consumption.

The economic impact of cracking in PV modules has been assessed in about 6 Euro/(kWp year) due to the cost of repair/substitution and the missing production while cracks are not yet observable with the naked eye. This has a clear huge technological and economic impact on the market that can be estimated in 180 MEuro/year of losses, by considering a conservative amount of 30 GWp of new installations in the World per year. If cracking cannot be avoided due to the brittleness of Silicon, the proposed idea to be taken to proof of concept is to limit its effect as much as possible. A new generation of PV modules displaying a superior resistance against cracking is proposed, starting from the fundamental discovery within the CA2PVM ERC StG project that residual thermo-mechanical compressive stresses in Silicon cells are beneficial to induce crack face contact and electric recovery. An innovative pre-stressing technique will be designed to increase the residual compressive stresses in Silicon and achieve the crack closure state for any crack and therefore avoid electrical power-losses. An exploitation strategy based on patenting of the technical solution, writing of a business plan, and founding a spin-off/start-up company with a team with interdisciplinary skills will be implemented. This will allow for fund raising and exploitation of the idea also based on the already established industrial contacts.",149500.0,149500.0,ERC-2016-PoC,ERC-POC,"SCUOLA IMT (ISTITUZIONI, MERCATI, TECNOLOGIE) ALTI STUDI DI LUCCA",IT,,,

1) Enable CCS as a key technology for combating climate change.
2) Make CCS technology commercially viable by 2020 via an EU-backed demonstration programme.
3) Accelerate R&D into next-generation CCS technology and its wide deployment post-2020.

Over a period of 21 months, the project would provide support to the energy stakeholders of the ZEP as it transitions to become a European Technology and Innovation Platform (ETIP). In particular, the project proposes the provision of secretariat, communications services and a contracted Chairperson to the ZEP.

By 2050 the EU aims at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% when compared to 1990 levels, requiring a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as biomass. Both the emissions from and the price of converting biomass to energy must be reduced if biomass is to compete with fossil fuels. 

Solution – the innovation
Dall Energy has developed a new, disruptive biomass furnace, which integrates several independent innovations into a novel concept for conversion of biomass into energy with at least 10% lower investment and 40-60% lower operational expenses, while at the same time reducing emissions to unprecedented low levels.

Customers and market 
Dall Energy targets three market segments, district heating, energy for industry and power production (in go-to-market order) of which the first alone constitutes a market value in EU of €17-19 billion, showing a growing trend. 

Impacts
Customers are offered lower investment and operational costs, minimal emissions, easier operation and high modulation capability. The reduced costs of energy from biomass will reduce or even bring down a critical barrier for EU to bring greenhouse gas emissions down, potentially having a tremendous impact on society.
Dall Energy expects a turnover of €83m and 1,810 jobs created by 2020 and EU will see a solution that is able to bring down emissions and increase both economic and technical efficiency as set forward by directive 20165/2193. 

The project
Commercial hypotheses will be tested through premium price models targeted turnkey partners, analyses of the market situation and risk assessments. Technical features of the Dall Energy furnace will be presented to four named potential turnkey partners, and they will give feedback on sales and price models, implementation strategy in production setup, and product application, product features and potential for further application development.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,DALL ENERGY APS,DK,,,

Nowadays RESs (solar, wind, etc.) and DES systems are connected to the grid via DC/AC converters (inverters). Currently these inverters do not provide the ancillary services required to avoid grid fluctuations derived from a growing share of RESs connected to the grid. Inverters playing an active role in grid stabilisation can efficiently mitigate some of the drawback that RESs have from an electric grid operator point of view such as transient grid-voltage fluctuations or frequency deviations. Synvertec, an Israeli company seed-funded by Horizon Green Tech Ventures (an investment alliance formed by Alstom S.A., Rotem Industries Ltd. and Gefen Investments) has developed and patented the Synchronverter, a system which connected to a standard inverter mimics the operation of a synchronous generator. Synchronverter integrates with existing inverters und turns them in effect into a virtual synchronous generator device being able to (i) actively respond to frequency changes and stabilize the voltage and (ii) imitate the inherent mechanical inertia of synchronous generators. The inverter market for renewable energy accounted in 2014 for more than €8.68 billion and is expected to exceed the €13.5 billion in 2017.

However, current LED technologies typically rely on expensive high-vacuum manufacturing processes, hampering their widespread applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-cost LEDs based on solution-processed semiconductors. 

A superstar in the family of solution-processed semiconductors is metal halide perovskites, which have shown great success in photovoltaic applications during the past few years. The same perovskites can also been applied in LEDs.

Two different classes of low-dimensional perovskites will be investigated independently. These new perovskites materials will then be coupled with novel interface engineering to fabricate perovskite LEDs with the performance beyond the state of the art. At the core of the research is the synthesis of new perovskite nanostructures, combined with advanced spectroscopic characterization and device development.

An overlooked error may cause multi-million dollar losses and time to market delays.

Today’s PV tools may take up to several days to make just one iteration on modern increasingly complex, dense (often billions of transistors)
microchips. The proposed disruptive ICT PV workflow along with an innovative cloud-based business model will set new rules and ultimately
disrupt the market. It will increase the competitiveness of European semiconductor microelectronics industry and advance enabling and industrial technologies.

This project will allow POLYTEDA CLOUD to further develop its product, increase revenues, generate jobs and seize the PV market, currently

-Move PV software and services from an outdated and ineffective CAPEX model using (dedicated expensive hardware and software) to a more cost-efficient OPEX model (pay-per-use of shared cloud-based resources).
-Lower the entry barrier for smaller design companies by using a high quality, cloud-ready PV workflow. This innovative solution and business
model for PV of semiconductor design optimize the manufacturing process with resulting cost-effectiveness.

Benefits for fabs include the higher quality of tape-outs, winning new clients and increasing sales of the fabs proprietary IP.

The joint action will focus on the demonstration and validation of innovative technologies for the generation of electricity from waves, tidal current, tidal range, salinity gradient and ocean thermal energy conversion, which will lead to improved performance, reliability and survivability of ocean energy conversion devices and arrays, and reduction in the levelised cost of energy (LCOE).   The project will comprise:
• A Co-funded Joint Call to support transnational, collaborative demonstration projects
• A second joint call to support transnational, collaborative research, development, demonstration and innovation  projects
• Joint activities to improve coordination between national / regional research programmes, coordinate with key stakeholders and promote knowledge transfer and exploitation of results
The project aims to build on European industrial leadership to help create a new industrial sector, which has potential to make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of Europe’s energy system, economic growth, job creation, particularly in peripheral regions.
The consortium represents the leading countries and regions in the European ocean energy sector – Scotland (UK), Sweden, Spain, Basque Country (Spain), Ireland, Portugal and Bretagne and Pays de la Loire (France).",9197015.57,3035015.14,H2020-LCE-2016-ERA,ERA-NET-Cofund,SCOTTISH ENTERPRISE,UK,STATENS ENERGIMYNDIGHET;CENTRO PARA EL DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO INDUSTRIAL.;REGION BRETAGNE;Région des Pays de la Loire;The sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland;ENTE VASCO DE LA ENERGIA;FUNDACAO PARA A CIENCIA E A TECNOLOGIA,SE;ES;FR;IE;PT,

The most advanced solution is the HVDC Supergrid. But fault currents remain an issue even if DC circuit breakers have emerged. These are not satisfying, whereas Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SCFCLs) using REBCO tapes bring an attractive solution. SCFCLs have already proved their outstanding performances in MVAC systems, with a few commercial devices in service. However, present REBCO conductors cannot be readily used at very high voltages: the electrical field under current limitation is too low and leads to too long tapes and high cost. FASTGRID aims to improve and modify the REBCO conductor, in particular its shunt, in order to significantly enhance (2 to 3 times) the electric field and so the economical SCFCL attractiveness. A commercial tape will be upgraded to reach a higher critical current and enhanced homogeneity as compared to today’s standards. For safer and better operation, the tape’s normal zone propagation velocity will be increased by at least a factor of 10 using the patented current flow diverter concept. The shunt surface will also be functionalized to boost the thermal exchanges with coolant. This advanced conductor will be used in a smart DC SCFCL module (1 kA – 50 kV). This one will include new functionalities and will be designed as sub-element of a real HVDC device. In parallel to this main line of work, developments will be carried out on a promising breakthrough path: ultra high electric field tapes based on sapphire substrates. FASTGRID will bring this to the next levels of technology readiness.
In conclusion, FASTGRID project aims at improving significantly existing REBCO conductor architecture to make SCFCLs economically attractive for HVDC Supergrids.

These savings will ultimately benefit airlines and their customers. It achieves this by delivering the ATM Master Plan goals (defined by the European Air Traffic Management (ATM) community) for a more efficient deployment of human resources,  a progressive increase in automation support, the implementation of virtualisation technologies and  the use of standardised and interoperable systems whilst increasing the safety level. 

Within the PJ16 proposal, there are two innovative solutions:
The first solution develops a concept for separating the Controller Working Position (CWP) from the datacentre where the data is produced. This lean and efficient use of ANSP infrastructure tackles the issues presented by fragmented European ATM systems and country-specific architectures, enabling Europe to move to an interoperable, cost-effective and flexible service provision infrastructure. Decoupling of the CWPs should enable a more efficient use of the most valuable and expensive resource, the human. By enabling increased flexibility the ANSPs should better manage staffing for prevailing traffic conditions and assure service continuity. 

The second solution deals with new methods of controller interaction with the Human Machine Interface (HMI), applying mature technologies from other domains to ATM. This will increase controller productivity, reduce workload, stress level and enable the use of SESAR advanced tools, safely facilitating performance based operations. Furthermore, the use of modern thin client technology and the processes for developing HMI solutions are investigated, aiming at more efficient CWP development and operation.

The project will accelerate diesel locomotive market transition from oil based diesel fuel to cheaper, cleaner and much more sustainable alternative and bio fuel - methane either in form of Liquefied (LNG) or Compressed (CNG) methane. Switching the fuel enables locomotive sector to strengthen the advantage railroads hold over trucks in long-haul shipping, comply with tougher environmental and exhaust standards and decrease fuel costs in the same time.
In recent years methane is getting a high attention from transport companies, investors, and government in rail sector with US leading the market development. Opportunity is being seized by GE, CAT, EMD and few smaller companies by piloting and testing their dual fuel products. EU is clearly lagging the rest of the world in the adoption of methane as the next gen fuel for locomotive applications. Being European company DiGas is bringing to market dual fuel product dedicated for locomotive sector out competing all similar products on a global scale. With today’s average cost of locomotive dual fuel retrofit  500k EUR, the proprietary game changing innovation enables multiple times decrease of locomotive retrofit costs combined with high diesel fuel substitution rate (60-80%) of the system allowing for commercially attractive payback periods (4 y for shunter and 2 y for main-lines) for rail operators.

They are able to transform electrical energy into mechanical and vice versa, which means that improving their performance entails transforming energy in a more efficient and sustainable way.
The best magnets are based on rare-earths (RE), however, their status as a Critical Raw Material (CRM) has brought forward the realization that it is of great strategic, geographic, environmental and socio-economic importance to consider alternative magnets that present a reduced amount (or absence) of RE. One of the most sought approaches towards this goal consists on constructing composite magnetic materials magnetically coupled at the interface.
In the framework of the success of a previous European Project (FP7-SMALL-NANOPYME-310516), focused on improving ferrite-based magnets, we developed a low-cost novel approach (Patent P201600092) that exploits the magnetostatic interactions within these composites and that yielded extremely promising results in the form of an experimental proof-of-concept. 
The goal of this project is to implement up-scalable and cost-efficient methods for fabrication of ferrite-based dense anisotropic magnets with a 40% enhanced magnetic performance (energy products above 55 kJ/m3) with respect to commercial ferrites. We aim at producing improved magnets that retain the advantages of ferrites –availability, sustainability, cost, recyclability, eco-friendliness- and which have the potential to substitute currently used RE magnets (CRM) in the electric power system.

The consortium’s aim in this project is to reduce the lifetime cost of tidal power by 20%, demonstrated by accelerated life testing of a next-generation tidal turbine power take-off (PTO) solution. Project outputs will be independently verified, and will enable: 

1.  Improved performance: 20% Lifetime Cost of Energy improvement over a conventional PTO
2.  Improved reliability: extending service intervals from less than 1 year to over 2 years
3.  Verified survivability: PTO design lifetime greater than 20 years

ENIGMA focuses mainly on critical zone observation, but the anticipated technological developments and scientific findings will also contribute to monitor and model the environmental footprint of an increasing range of subsurface activities, including large-scale water abstraction and storage, enhanced geothermal systems and subsurface waste and carbon storage. While many subsurface structure imaging methods are now mature and broadly used in research and practice, our ability to resolve and monitor subsurface fluxes and processes, including solute transport, heat transfer and biochemical reactions, is much more limited. The shift from classical structure characterization to dynamic process imaging, driven by ENIGMA, will require the development of multi-scale hydrogeophysical methods with adequate sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, and novel inverse modelling concepts.

This question is more frequently asked these days either by solar farms operators, venture capitalists willing to invest in renewable energy or companies specialized in operations and maintenance. Comparing irradiance data observed from the ground with data coming from relevant geostationary satellite should provide the answer. 
e-SPACE Monitoring aims at delivering PV operators with a permanent PV performance assessment on line service. Through a SAAS platform, operators will access data based on measures correlation between a stand-alone ground-based solar irradiance measurement sensor and satellite data coming from geostationary meteorological satellites completed by Sentinel 4 & 5 satellites and Copernicus services.
By using data analysis algorithms, e-SPACE Monitoring’s personalized service will be able to point out discrepancies between the solar data measured on site and the plant’s actual solar production. This information will be used by plant operators to set up personalized Key Performance Indicators showing whether a solar installation is working at its full potential or not and improve the Operations & Maintenance of their PV installations.
In the coming years, e-SPACE Monitoring will enable REUNIWATT to take advantage of the tremendous growth of the installed solar base worldwide and resulting PV monitoring market. REUNIWATT has a huge opportunity to market a service that will benefit thousands of solar operators globally and contribute to the development of solar power efficiency.

Secondary aluminium recycling and ceramic processing were identified as key examples with economically recoverable waste heat. Several challenges are inherent; these processes are batch-based rather than continuous with corrosive particulate-laden flue gas over a wide temperature range. The Smartrec system meets these challenges by development of a standard, modular solution for integration of heat recovery with thermal storage that valorises medium to high grade waste heat, adaptable to different temperatures and industries. Following end-user analysis and characterisation of exhaust streams and waste products, full life cycle costing and assessment will be carried out with candidate molten salts selected for thermal storage and heat transfer fluid, validated by corrosion testing.

To exceed this goal a commercial CSP plant of > 1GW of nominal capacity is foreseen, in which  high nominal capacity of CSP plant is reached in a modular way where each MOSAIC module delivers thermal energy to linked thermal energy storage systems that supply their energy to a high capacity power block (>1GW). This modular configuration guarantees reliability, flexibility and dispatchability according to the needs of the electrical grid while reduces significantly the specific cost of the Power block (€/MW installed).  
Each MOSAIC module consists of an innovative fixed spherical mirror concentrator arranged in a semi-Fresnel manner and an actuated receiver based on a low cost closed loop cable tracking system. This configuration reduces the moving parts of the whole system decreasing solar field cost while keeping high concentration ratios. This will assure high working temperatures thus high cycle efficiencies and a cost effective use of thermal storage systems. 
Energy from the sun is collected, concentrated and transferred to the heat transfer fluid at module level where, due to the modular concept, distances from the solar concentrator to the receiver are much shorter that those typical from solar tower technologies. As a result, the efficiency of energy collection is maximized, atmospherical attenuation is minimized and accuracy requirements can be relaxed.
All these technical benefits contribute to a much lower capital cost of the whole system while keeping efficiency and reliability. This has consequently a strong impact in the final cost of electricity production.

Sophisticated functionality, such as the selective chemical transformation of substrates in enzymes, emerges from the interplay of the individual components that are often grouped around a nanoscopic cavity. Control mechanisms based on the cooperative binding of signal substances regulate the enzyme’s action, and complicated feedback loops may apply.
Since the advent of supramolecular chemistry, scientists construct artificial systems with ever increasing complexity and functionality that promise to serve as the basis for future developments in bottom-up nanotechnology with applications in medicine (drug delivery), diagnostics, catalysis, material science and molecular photonics/electronics.
Self-assembly of functional entities with pre-programmed connectivities has produced an impressive line-up of nanoscopic architectures such as coordination cages that recognize and transform molecular substrates. Most of these systems are based on one sort of ligand, joined by one kind of metal ion. My group has reported a number of cages, each equipped with a unique, single function such as chirality, redox-activity, light-switching, allosteric regulation or endohedral binding sites.
While all these mono-functionalized cages contribute to the progress of supramolecular architecture, nature demonstrates that the key to the most sophisticated systems lies in multi-functionalized structures.
As breakthrough strategies for achieving this level of complexity with artificial systems we propose:
1) Heteroleptic coordination of ligands by a [Pd2Ligand4]-platform-specific way of steric fine-tuning
2) Biopolymer-inspired folding of a modular chain of covalently joined building blocks

The Europe 2020 strategy calls for a Bioeconomy as a key element for smart and green growth in Europe. However, the complex inter-dependencies that exist between challenges can lead to trade-offs, such as the controversy about competing uses of biomass. The latter arose from concerns about the potential impact of the growing demand for renewable biological resources by other sectors on food security, the use of scare natural resources and the environment in Europe and third countries. 

On 13th of February 2012 the EU launched the Bioeconomy strategy and action plan on 'Innovating for Sustainable Growth: a Bioeconomy for Europe', which aims to pave the way to a more innovative, resource efficient and competitive society that reconciles food security with the sustainable use of renewable resources for industrial purposes, while ensuring environmental protection.

In this respect the Strategy stresses that participatory models are needed that engage citizens and end-users in order to reinforce the relationship between science, society and policy making. More informed dialogues will in fact allow science and innovation to provide a sound basis for policy making and informed societal choices by taking into account legitimate societal concerns and needs in the Bioeconomy.

In this framework, and in support of the review and implementation of the strategy, this 4th Bioeconomy Stakeholders Conference on April 12-13 2016 will provided opportunity for public awareness raising and for an informed dialogue on the progress of the Bioeconomy, involving researchers, stakeholders, policy makers and the civil society at large across the whole Bioeconomy value chain.

We will revolutionize the way biopharmaceuticals are produced by developing a microalgae based biorefinery platform. These biorefineries will utilize genetically engineered microalgae to efficiently produce pharmaceutical agents. Microalgae are photosynthetic micro-organisms that have unique advantages as biopharmaceutical production systems, including high growth rate, ease of cultivation and low growth costs, enabling cost effective and scalable yield of active ingredients.

Therefore, the main objectives of the GrInHy project focus on:

•  Proof of reaching an overall electrical efficiency of at least 80 %LHV (ca. 95 %HHV);
•  Scaling-up the SOEC unit to a DC power input (stack level) of 120 kWel;
•  Reaching a lifetime of greater 10,000 h with a degradation rate below 1 %/1,000 h;
•  Integration and operation for at least 7,000 h meeting the hydrogen quality standards of the steel industry;

Additional project objectives are:
•  Elaboration of an Exploitation Roadmap for cost reducing measures;
•  Development of dependable system cost data;
•  Integration of a reversible operation mode (fuel cell mode);

The objectives are congruent with the call FCH-02.4-2015 and the Multi Annual Work Plan of the FCH JU.

Intelligent traffic systems benefit from many technical innovations, for example. Mobile phones, radars, cameras and magnetometers can be used to measure traffic evolution and provide large sets of valuable data. Vehicles can communicate with the network infrastructure, as well as each other. However, these huge technological advances have not been used to the full so far. Traffic lights are far from functioning optimally and traffic management systems do not always prevent the occurrence of congestions.
So what is missing? Such systems affect our daily life; why aren’t them on pace with technology advances? Possible because they have become far more complex than the analytical tools available for managing them. Systems have many components, communicate with each other, have self-decision-making mechanisms, share an enormous amount of information, and form networks. Research in control systems has challenged some of these features, but not in a very concerted way. There is a lack of “glue” relating the solutions to each other.

• Used grass and infill high-quality re-installation 
• 100% infill reclaim, separation, cleaning and sanitary treatment
• 4x faster old turf removal and 2x faster full field renewal
• 50% cost reduction of old field utilization and 50% savings from new installation

We aim to achieve a zero-waste concept and improve the environmental sustainability of synthetic grass installations. Our unique ARENA concept enables to eliminate current landfilling and reuse 100% of the materials in new fields or as recycled raw materials in other industries. As a result, we:

• Prevent 1 million tonnes of mixed wastes from landfilling annually
• Reduce field renewal transportation need by 10-times, leading to 95% less CO2 emissions

The innovation project objective is a complete robotic inspection and cleaning system that will clean glass surfaces autonomously and reduce the cost of generating solar energy.
Solar electricity offers a clean alternative to carbon based energy sources, but its global uptake has been limited due to the comparatively high cost of energy generation. Although the cost of generation is consistently reducing through advances in manufacturing and panel efficiencies, operational costs continue to play a major role in preventing solar power plants from reaching true market competitiveness and contribute to their continued need for government subsidy.
Large scale solar installations comprise vast areas of panel surface which are subject to atmospheric and biological deposits. These deposits can reduce the generation efficiency of the solar power plant by up to 30%. 
Current methods for cleaning and maintaining solar panels rely on significant amounts of labour sometimes operating in inhospitable environments, which can account for more than 20% of annual O&M costs for a plant and in some areas of the planet are becoming more of a problem with the increase of dust owing to the changing climate. This is especially true for the growing CSP market which is highly sensitive to even minor reductions to irradiation levels.

Oddly enough, the low availability has almost always been due to control issues and hybridisation strategies rather than problems in the fuel cells themselves.

Giantleap aims to increase the availability and reduce the total cost of ownership of FCEBs by increasing the lifetime and reliability of the fuel cell system; this will be achieved with advanced online diagnostics of the fuel cells and the balance-of-plant components of the system, coupled with prognostics methods to calculate the system's residual useful life, and advanced control algorithms able to exploit this information to maximise the system's life.
The same control system will also be engineered for robustness, in order to increase availability to the level of diesel buses or better.

Giantleap will improve the understanding of degradation in fuel-cell systems with extensive experimentation and analysis; diagnostic and prognostic methods will focus on exploitation of current sensors to make the novel control approach cost-effective.
Giantleap includes the demonstration of a prototype in relevant environment, allowing the project to reach technology readiness level 6.

The prototype will be a trailer-mounted fuel-cell based range extender meant for battery city buses. The ability to swap out the range extender in case of malfunctions greatly increases the availability of the bus, while the large battery capacity allows the bus to complete its route should malfunctions occur during usage.

The project will deploy a total of 2,650 new fuel cell microCHP units with real customers and monitor them for an extended period. This will:
- Enable fuel cell mCHP manufacturers to scale up production, using new series techniques, and increased automation. By 2018, four leading European manufacturers (Bosch, SOLIDpower, Vaillant and Viessmann) will have installed capacity for production of over 1,000 units/year (each will install over 500 units in PACE). These production lines will test the manufacturing techniques which will allow for mass market scale up and the reductions in unit cost which will come from associated economies of scale.
- Allow the deployment of new innovations in fuel cell microCHP products, which reduce unit cost by over 30%, increase stack lifetime to over 10 years (by end of the project) and improve the electrical efficiency of all units.
- Create a large dataset of the performance of the units, which will demonstrate the readiness of fuel cell mCHP as a mass market product. This will prove that fuel cell mCHP can be a leading contributor to reducing primary energy consumption and GHG emissions across Europe.
- Allow the units in the trial to be pooled in a large scale test of the concept of aggregating and controlling the output from mCHP to act as a virtual power plant. This will be achieved in a project run by EWE on a section of the German grid earmarked for smart grid trials.
- Act as the basis for an effort to standardise mCHP products in Europe, helping create a more efficient market for both installers and component suppliers.

Of these, the most ecoefficient bioplastic is PLA as it is biodegradable, requires 50% less energy and produces 10 times less emissions in comparison to standard thermoplastics like PET and PP. Furthermore, as it does not need to be recycled, it not only saves the energy and cost involved, but also the fact that only a fraction of the plastic produced reaches the recycling plant, the rest ending up in landfill or the sea.

However, biodegradable plastics only make up approximately 0.2% of plastics produced in 2014. This is because conventional PLA has certain technical limitations which reduce the number of marketable applications where it can be used. For example, it cannot compete with standard thermoplastic grades used in packaging applications (such as PET and PE), in terms of oxygen and water vapour barrier and thermal properties, which are the most demanded properties for packaging requirements.
Advanced & Functional Technologies for Biocomposites S.L (ADBIOCOMPOSITES) has developed an innovative, biodegradable PLA grade named BlockPLA which has enhanced technical properties: oxygen and water vapour barrier, thermal stability, transparency and flexibility. BlockPLA solves the drawbacks that PLA currently shows for packaging applications. In addition, BlockPLA has food contact approval and requires less energy to be produced. Production costs are slightly lower than conventional PLA.

Therefore, BlockPLA is a real biodegradable alternative to PET, PP and PLA for packaging applications in the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical and biomedical industry, home care packaging, cosmetics industry and others.

In addition, these cells are manually assembled into stacks resulting in extra steps for joining and sealing that difficult the standardization and quality control of the final product while introducing weak parts likely to fail. Since current ceramics processing presents strong limitations in shape and extremely complex design for manufacturing (more than 100 steps), industrially fabricated SOFC cells and stacks are expensive and present low flexibility and long time to market. This is particularly relevant for the commercial segment of the stationary fuel cells market (5-400kW) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of the overall power and heat requirements and requires customization of the final product.

The main goal of the Cell3Ditor project is to develop a 3D printing technology for the industrial production of SOFC stacks by covering research and innovation in all the stages of the industrial value chain (inks formulation, 3D printer development, ceramics consolidation and system integration). All-ceramic joint-free SOFC stacks with embedded fluidics and current collection will be fabricated in a two-step process (single-step printing and sintering) to reduce in energy, materials and assembly costs while simplifying the design for manufacturing and time to market.  

Compared to traditional ceramic processing, the Cell3Ditor manufacturing process presents a significantly shorter time to market (from years to months) and a cost reduction estimated in 63% with an initial investment below one third of an equivalent conventional manufacturing plant (production of 1000 units per year).

The resulting vast network, often called the Internet of Things, will revolutionise society. To realise this will require the ability to produce electronic circuitry extremely cheaply, often on unconventional substrates. This will be achieved through printed electronics, by the assembly of devices from solution (i.e. ink) using methods adapted from printing technology. However, while printed electronics has been advancing rapidly, the development of new, nano-materials-based inks is required for this area to meet its true potential.
We believe recent developments in liquid exfoliation of 2D nanosheets have given us the ideal family of materials to revolutionise electronic ink production. Liquid exfoliation can transform layered crystals into suspensions of nanosheets in very large quantities. In this way we can produce liquid-dispersed nanosheets of a wide range of types including conducting (e.g. graphene, MXenes, TiB2 etc), semiconducting (e.g. MoS2, WSe2, GaS, Black phosphorous etc), insulating (e.g. BN, talc) or electrochemically active (e.g. MoO3, Ni(OH)2, MnO2 etc). These nanosheets can be deposited from liquid to form porous networks of defined electronic type. While these networks have huge applications potential, a large amount of work must be done to translate them into working printed devices.
In this project, we will develop methods to transform large volume suspensions of exfoliated nanosheets into bespoke 2D inks with properties engineered for a range of specific printed device applications. We will learn to use this 2D ink to print patterned or large area 2D nanosheet networks with controlled structure, allowing us to tune the electrical properties of the network during printing. We will combine networks of different nanosheet types into complex heterostructures. This will allow us to print all device components (electrodes, active layers, dielectrics, energy storage layers) from one contiguous, multi-component network. In this way we will produce 2D network transistors, solar cells, displays and energy storage systems.

However, emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines of non-volatile PM, consisting primarily of soot particles, are of international concern today. Despite the lack of knowledge toward soot formation processes and characterization in terms of mass and size, engine manufacturers have now to deal with both gas and particles emissions. Furthermore, heat transfer understanding, that is also influenced by soot radiation, is an important matter for the improvement of the combustor’s durability, as the key point when dealing with low-emissions combustor architectures is to adjust the air flow split between the injection system and the combustor’s walls. The SOPRANO initiative consequently aims at providing new elements of knowledge, analysis and improved design tools, opening the way to:
• Alternative designs of combustion systems for future aircrafts that will enter into service after 2025 capable of simultaneously reducing gaseous pollutants and particles, 
• Improved liner lifetime assessment methods.
Therefore, the SOPRANO project will deliver more accurate experimental and numerical methodologies for predicting the soot emissions in academic or semi-technical combustion systems.

The focus of the project will be on the hydrogen separation through a combination of membranes, electrochemical separation and temperature swing adsorption to be able to decrease the total cost of hydrogen recovery. The project targets a pure hydrogen separation system with power and cost of < 5 kWh/kgH2 and < 1.5 €/kgH2. A pilot designed for 25 kg/day of hydrogen will be built and tested.

To achieve this, HyGrid aims at developing novel hybrid system integrating three technologies for hydrogen purification integrated in a way that enhances the strengths of each of them: Membrane separation technology is employed for removing H2 from the “low H2 content” (e.g. 2-10 %) followed by electrochemical hydrogen separation (EHP ) optimal for the “very low H2 content” (e.g. <2 %) and finally temperature swing adsorption (TSA) technology to purify from humidity produced in both systems upstream. The objective is to give a robust proof of concept and validation of the new technology (TRL 5) by designing, building, operating and validating a prototype system tested at industrial relevant conditions for a continuous and transient loads. To keep the high NG grid storage capacity for H2, the separation system will target the highest hydrogen recovery.

The project will describe and evaluate the system performance for the different pressure ranges within 0.03 to 80 bar (distribution to transmission) and test the concept at pilot scale in the 6-10 bar range.

HyGrid will evaluate hydrogen quality production according to ISO 14687 in line not only with fuel cell vehicles (Type I Grade D) but also stationary applications (Type I Grade A) and hydrogen fueled ICE (Type I grade E category 3).

That failure costs lives, money and efficiency. Smart people in the transport business need Silent Sensors smart technology.

The Silent Sensors system manages tyres through every stage from manufacture to maintenance and monitoring for repair, reuse and recycling.  By doing so it delivers three things:

•Greater fuel efficiency – when 25% of a haulage company’s costs are fuel, small fuel savings become big. With the Silent Sensors tyre management system we estimate between 2% and 6% fuel savings.
•Increased tyre life – by managing your tyres properly, you will achieve a significantly longer life for tyres. Spread over thousands of tyres used annually in a fleet, this leads to more money retained by the business.
•Much safer tyres – 20% of road accidents are caused by tyre failures. When tyres are properly maintained by Silent Sensors systems, there are fewer failures, and much safer transport.

Silent Sensors provides an efficient, easy tyre management system at a low cost using patented RFID technology. It measures tyre pressure, tread and temperature by simply applied sensors, allowing fleet owners to better manage one of their most vital resources. It is a precise, practical and world-leading system.

The skilled, experienced team behind Silent Sensors have brought the system to a point where trials are in progress with a large fleet truck business in the UK. The Phase 1 feasibility study will create an elaborated business case that should support the development and commercialisation of this solution, initially working with our UK trial partner, then trials in Scandinavia and India and eventual expansion to the remainder of Europe and Asia, specifically China. The study will support the next steps which will require the Phase 2 funding to develop the prototype sensor product to a mass manufactured version where economies of production and scale will reduce costs to a level that will make it irresistible.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2016-2017,SME-1,SILENT SENSORS LIMITED,UK,,,

The PHOSave specific objectives are:
1) Developing an innovative eco-compatible method for removing the powders’ oil component that is nowadays an unsolved industrial and environmental problem;
2) Implementing a pilot plant for the treatment of the exhausted extinguishing powder recovering phosphate included in them;
3) Contributing to the implementation of new eco-sustainable waste management methods, recovering a high added-value non-renewable raw material (phosphate) and being the first industrial level plant constructed in the world;
4) Obtaining fundamental raw materials for the formulation of specialty fertilizers for agricultural use achieving further environmental benefits in term of reduced greenhouse gas emissions;
5) The recovery of raw material will fit also into an already mature market: flame retardant chemicals and chipboard panel.

The widespread use of PHOSave technology will maximize profits and environmental aspects. The following goals will be achieved: a solution to the problem of exhausted extinguishing powder (which is a special waste); the reduction of CO2 in the industrial chain and the recovery of raw materials in an almost pure form (phosphorus obtained at 95% at lab scale).

waste management are more restrictive each year (e.g Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC), but unfortunately, landfill disposal still
represents 34% of total MSW generated. On the other hand, citizen awareness as well as the high fees operators pay for
landfill disposal, have helped to greatly increase the percentage for recycling from 18% in 1995, to 42% in 2012.

However, 40% of all the glass waste ends up in mixed MSW plants (which typically contain 7% of glass). Instead of being
disposed of in selective-waste collection, it ends up in landfills or is composted/incinerated with the remnant waste.

We have developed SEEGLASS, a high performance optical sorter based on computer vision and a pneumatic rejection
system. Our aim is to solve this non-environmentally friendly problem, while also offering our end-users additional revenues
with this recovered material, which is not being exploited now (49€/tn glass). In addition, extracting this glass, will allow the
treatment plants to significantly reduce costs from waste disposal fees (50€/Tonne EU average and rising). Payback for
customers is estimated in only 19 months.

With 25 billion ‘things’ connected by 2020, the sheer volume, velocity and structure of data from the Internet of Things (IoT) already challenges network capacity. Bottlenecks affect security, data, storage management, servers and the data centre networks. 

Using groundbreaking sensor data reduction techniques, Teraki software enables users to extract the maximum potential of their IoT applications otherwise constrained by limited battery lifetime and/or prohibitive connectivity costs. 

We can leverage up to 10 times more data at the sensor level without additional computation resources. Battery life is improved; data transmission and processing latency and storage requirements are reduced. Privacy is strongly enhanced since only partial data is sent. The result is a 90% reduction in IT costs, and 50% less in maintenance costs for connected sensor systems. 

The most common data reduction solutions for sensor networks are compression techniques. Compression requires high computational resources at the sensor with high impact on battery life. Teraki will render embedded sensor compression techniques obsolete since our solution needs no additional resources and the data selection and further analysis can be done in real time.

The goal of this project is to identify the most appropriate IoT market verticals for commercialization and continue market validation activities.

To study light at this small length scale it is essential to employ techniques that can excite and image light at the nanoscale. In recent years, my group has explored cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy for this purpose. Based on the exciting potential of this technique, I propose to design and construct a new time- and angle-resolved CL microscope that exploits the primary electron beam as a coherent optical excitation source with deep-subwavelength spatial resolution. We will use the new instrument to address four challenges that will provide new insight in the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Specifically, we will:
(1) use CL microscopy to excite and characterize ultra-short wavelength-plasmons on graphene. We will create 3D tomographic reconstructions of the local optical density of states in resonant plasmonic and dielectric nanostructures. 
(2) determine 2D and 3D spatially-resolved ultrafast carrier recombination processes in resonant semiconductor photovoltaic nanostructures and reveal the radiative properties of single quantum emitters. 
(3) develop CL momentum spectroscopy to reveal embedded eigenstates in dielectric photonic crystals and topological photonic protection in complex three-dimensional architectures. 
(4) develop CL polarimetry in combination with phase-resolved CL detection to study electric and magnetic polarizabilities in nanoscale light emitters and to control the orbital angular momentum of light.
The proposed program will firmly establish time- and angle-resolved CL imaging spectroscopy as a key deep-subwavelength nanoscopy tool to investigate the interplay of electric and magnetic fields that constitute light at the nano scale, and will enable applications in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, photonic and optoelectronic integrated circuits, quantum communication, sensing and metrology.",2495625.0,2495625.0,ERC-2015-AdG,ERC-ADG,STICHTING NEDERLANDSE WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK INSTITUTEN,NL,,,

This makes urban waste management increasingly challenging, both in terms of logistics and environmental or health impacts. To decrease the cities’ environmental impacts and to contribute to a better resilience of urban areas towards energy or food supply crisis, waste management systems have to be improved to increase recycling of resources and local valorization. In this context, the DECISIVE project proposes to change the present urban metabolism for organic matter (foods, plants, etc.), energy and biowaste to a more circular economy and to assess the impacts of these changes on the whole waste management cycle. Thus, the challenge will be to shift from a urban “grey box”, implying mainly goods importation and extra-urban waste management, to a cooperative organization of intra- and peri-urban networks enabling circular local and decentralised valorization of biowaste, through energy and bioproducts production. Such a new waste management paradigm is expected to increase the sustainability of urban development by: (1) promoting citizens awareness about waste costs and values; (2) promoting renewable energy production and use in the city; (3) developing an industrial ecology approach that can promote the integration between urban and peri-urban areas, by providing valuable agronomic by-products for urban agriculture development  and so improving the balance of organic products and waste in the city; (4) developing new business opportunities and jobs. In order to achieve these objectives, the project DECISIVE will develop and demonstrate, at real scale, eco-innovative solutions addressed to waste operators and public services, consisting in: (1) a decision support tool to plan, design and assess efficient decentralised management networks for biowaste in urban areas; (2) eco-designed solid-state fermentation processes.

Thanks to the Civitas Initiative, the partner cities expect to prove that more efficient and sustainable mobility is conducive to the establishment of vital and multi-modal hubs for urban, regional, national and International movements of passengers and goods. To do this, they establish integrated living laboratories clustering local measures according to four major aspects of sustainable urban mobility:
1. Governance: to increase port-city collaborative planning and participation, leading to enhanced forms of SUMPs. 2. People: to foster less car-dependent mobility styles, leading to modal shift in favour of collective and more active transport. 3.

One option to address this is to use excess generator capacity during off-peak demand periods to produce hydrogen (H2), a high energy-content, carbon-free fuel that can be mixed with natural gas and distributed to end-users via existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure, where its energy content is recovered via combustion in conventional gas-turbine (GT) power plants. H2-enrichment, however, dramatically alters the combustion dynamics of natural-gas and its effect on turbulent flame dynamics, combustion stability and pollutant formation in GT combustors is not well enough understood today for this scenario to be safely implemented with existing power plants.

The objective of this study is to facilitate Europe’s transition to a reliable and cost-effective energy system based on carbon-free renewable power generation. It will accomplish this by developing advanced laser measurement techniques for use in high-pressure combustion test facilities and using them to acquire the data necessary to develop robust predictive analysis tools for hydrogen-enriched natural gas combustor technology.

The new market we are developing is a world first, sitting between manual manufacturing and full production line assembly. Neither existing solutions are cost effective with the current levels of EVs being produced.

Our solution is a fully automated final assembly cell, with 3 autonomous robots situated around a central industry build location. Our main innovation is our method of assembly, the 3 robots work symbiotically to assemble modules into finished products. This design provides a footprint that is 12 times smaller than traditional production lines. We have incorporated our state of the art gripper technology for fully adaptable programmable robotic heads that can accommodate 12 different design options, allowing assembly of small batches in a cost effective manner.  Our modular format allows fully flexible manufacturing, appealing to the increasing customer demand for evermore customised products.

The high flexibility required to accommodate small series customised products alongside the commercial need to run a cost effective practice is challenging a number of manufacturing industries. When demonstrating the prototype at the Hannover Messe 2015, we received significant interest from a number of industries beyond the EV market including domestic appliances and medical technology opening further opportunities for us to capitalise on.

Forecasted to have a global worth of €184 bn by 2020, the automation solutions industry is growing.

A infection initiates with the dissemination of the fast-replicating tachyzoites. At the onset of the immune response tachyzoites convert into slow-growing bradyzoites that form cysts in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscles. Encystation ensures life-long persistence and poses a significant threat of reactivation during immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and severe clinical manifestations. Despite the importance of encystation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. We propose to determine the molecular mechanisms governing cyst wall formation and parasite adaption to encystation. We will capitalize on the increased sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, the high-resolution microscopy, and on the ex-vivo tissue examination by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry and NanoSIMS technologies.The specific objectives are to:

Fathoming the core of these atoms is the realm of nuclear physics, but current approaches are detached from fundamental theory and instead are mainly based on fitting phenomenological models to experimental data. 
The ambitious aim of this project is to provide the missing link between fundamental theory and nuclear physics.
At the heart of the methodology for this audacious proposal is a concept known as a topological soliton -- a particle-like solution of a nonlinear wave equation, where stability is due to a topological twisting or winding. A combination of analytic and numerical work over the last twenty years has shown that topological solitons can provide a reasonable qualitative description of some aspects of nuclei, but a quantitative comparison has failed because of a long-standing problem that soliton predictions yield nuclear binding energies that are too large. However, in recent work by the researcher (Naya-Rodriguez) and collaborators, and independently by the supervisor (Sutcliffe), significant breakthroughs have been made that demonstrate the ability to reduce soliton binding energies to the correct nuclear physics levels and hence solve this long-standing problem. These new developments mean that this proposal is incredibly timely, and by uniting these two previously independent European groups there is an opportunity to make ground-breaking progress by developing these new analytical methods in combination with state-of-the-art computing capabilities.

Thus, our solution consists on a simple processing technology that can be adapted within biodiesel plants, for the production of eco-polyols from used oil or biodiesel, increasing their productivity while valorizing a product usually considered as residue (used oil). In this way, we eliminate the issue of limited availability of resources and their associated pricing fluctuations.

With their new technology, ECO STOCK, ETC aims to develop new eco-efficient, transportable and modular thermal storage solutions.
The first step is to collect industrial wastes, such as coal fly ashes, and transform them into refractory ceramic. This exploitation of industrial waste induces a reduction in the exploitation of raw materials, while producing an eco-efficient material providing effective heat storage.
Subsequently, the second challenge of the ECO STOCK project is to use those ceramics, composed of industrial wastes, in order to develop a thermal energy storage unit (TESU) solution. This solution proposes a modular, plug&play and transportable unit capable of valuing industries’ loss heat and power, creating in the same time a reduction in energy costs.
Indeed, using those inorganic secondary raw materials, transformed into refractory ceramic, it has the advantage to propose a low cost storage material and exploit the “below 1000°C temperatures” recycling market.

In all cases, there is a technological need for effective and environmentally benign solutions that provide secure adhesion during use, while also permitting for a simple and clean separation of bonded parts “on command” without the need for additional complex process steps.

The proposed project aims to develop new debond-on-demand adhesives based on the combination of low-molecular weight functional polymers and light-responsive degradable cross-linking agents. The new materials are expected to combine optimal adhesive properties for a wide range of substrates with a new mechanism that enables straightforward and efficient, ultraviolet light-induced debonding at ambient temperature. The debonding mechanism involves two different effects that are combined in a synergistic manner: the controlled degradation of the cross-linker transforms polymer networks into low-molecular weight polymers, and the simultaneous release of nitrogen gas “propels” the bonded parts away from each other. The degraded polymer residues can be easily removed and clean debonded components are furnished. The overarching goals of the proposed project are to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and implementation by (i) providing a better understanding for the mechanism at play; (ii) demonstrating the effect in a variety of adhesive platforms based on polymers that are employed in current adhesive technologies; and (iii) providing technology demonstrators for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes and cold-cured two-component adhesives with debond-on-demand properties.",149250.0,149250.0,ERC-2015-PoC,ERC-POC,UNIVERSITE DE FRIBOURG,CH,,,

As a consequence homes can no longer ventilate resulting in poor indoor air quality. Thus, the use of efficient ventilation is becoming increasingly important. But ventilation causes significant heat loss, reducing the energy-efficiency of the building. Although advances in last years, current trends in energy systems for climate control and water heating in residential buildings are still unsustainable and
further energy savings are fundamental.

Significant energy savings can be achieved by combining: (1) an AHU with a heat exchanger and (2) a heat pump to heat
water, in a single unit (COMBI-AHU). To reach the household market, COMBI-AHU systems must be re-engineered. The key
is an optimized electronic control system for higher efficiency to allow the unit to generate more heat per m2. LS Control,
leveraged by its high expertise in electronics, developed a set of cutting edge algorithms and electronic parts to control a
COMBI-AHU, allowing disruptive results in terms of efficiency. SmartCOMBI project will contribute to the EU Energy goals
by: improving the energy efficiency (COP increase by 25-35%); decrease the energy wastage (>95% of energy recovered);
Decrease the GHG emissions.

The SmartCOMBI project aims to optimize and demonstrate a novel and cost-effective control platform, resulting in cost
savings and benefits for end-users (lower running and installation costs, optimized comfort and healthier environment; better
control of expenses – web user interface) and manufacturers (faster route to market and lower customization cost;
certification and high energy labels; gain competitive advantage by offering high efficient and cutting edge technology,

Benefit of cross-experience and inter-disciplinary synergies will create new knowledge. INFRASTAR proposes innovative solutions for civil infrastructure asset management so that young scientists will acquire a high employment profile in close dialogue between industry and academic partners.

Diamond anvil cells (DAC) recently generated pressures above 400GPa, accessing conditions where the mechanical work of compression equals the chemical bonding energy.  Most elements undergo dramatic structural changes in this regime, and rival predictions for hydrogen include molecular and atomic metals, superfluidity, superconductivity and one-dimensional melting.  Yet when the new phase IV was discovered in 2011, it was none of these things: it was a totally unexpected complex molecular insulator. At these conditions experimental data is sparse: we must exploit it to the fullest extent, yet previous theoretical work has concentrated on routine density functional theory (DFT) simulation producing unmeasurable predictions.  I will conduct a programme combining neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy with theory and simulation focused on measurable quantities.  This will require developing and implementing heuristic theories which do not currently exist.

I will develop methods to find free energy, theory to extract Raman frequencies and linewidths from simulation, and techniques to determine the signature from entanglement of quantum rotors.

petroleum), which are known for their great environmental impact. In particular, we will develop new biopolymer resins that replace the synthetic compounds currently used by tanners.
In order to obtain better performance than what is currently possible with synthetic polyurethane compounds treated with other materials, we will use specific nano-materials for improving the mechanical and hydrophobic properties that the new finishing products impart to treated leather.

Put simply this process involves a molecule absorbing a photon, and the resulting electron-hole pair ‘sharing’ its energy with a neighbouring molecule, to produce two electron-hole pairs. As such, SF has the potential to double the electrical current generated by these molecules from sunlight. While it has been studied since the 1960s, new experimental techniques developed in the host laboratory have recently lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of SF. The aim is of this project is to understand the intricacies of SF so that it can be exploited to achieve dramatic increases in device efficiencies.

The host group is world-renowned for using spectroscopy to produce breakthroughs in our understanding of organic electronics and quantum chemistry. The second will leverage the applicant’s background in physical chemistry to engineer SF systems with control on a molecular length scale. By combining these two innovations the project is expected to produce important results for the research community.

But barriers also provide energy, water, fishing and leisure opportunities, and may also help to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Improving stream connectivity has been flagged as one of the priorities for more efficient stream restoration but effective rehabilitation of ecosystem functioning in European rivers needs to take the complexity and trade-offs imposed by barriers into account. 

AMBER will deliver innovative solutions to river fragmentation in Europe by developing more efficient methods of restoring stream connectivity through adaptive barrier management. The project seeks to address the complex challenge of river fragmentation through a comprehensive barrier adaptive management process, based on the integration of programme design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions about barrier mitigation, adapt and learn.",6238103.75,6020172.75,H2020-SC5-2015-two-stage,RIA,SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,UK,"IASCACH INTIRE EIREANN;INNOGY SE;ASOCIACION PARA EL ESTUDIO Y MEJORADE LOS SALMONIDOS AEMS;ELECTRICITE DE FRANCE;UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM;CONSERVATOIRE NATIONAL DU SAUMON SAUVAGE;INSTYTUT RYBACTWA SRODLADOWEGO IM STANISTAWA SAKOWICZA;KAUPPERT KLEMENS;STICHTING WERELD VISMIGRATIE;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON;WWF SCHWEIZ;DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET;UNIVERSIDAD DE OVIEDO;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;SYDKRAFT HYDROPOWER AB;EUROPEJSKIE REGIONALNE CENTRUM EKOHYDROLOGII POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK;RWE INNOGY GMBH;UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK -  NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, CORK;JRC -JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE- EUROPEAN COMMISSION",IE;DE;ES;FR;UK;PL;NL;CH;DK;IT;SE;BE,

The STAMP project is aimed at obtaining a peak capacity of one million in liquid-phase analytical separations. Spatial three-dimensional liquid chromatography will be used to achieve this goal. The major advantage of this technique is that all second-dimension separations and – in a next step – all third-dimension separations are performed in parallel. This allows high-resolution separations to be performed in each dimension, while the total analysis time remains reasonable. Optical and mass-spectrometric imaging techniques are envisaged as detection methods after printing (STAMPing) the effluent from the 3D separation body on a suitable substrate. The STAMP project also has a number of sub-targets that will bring additional significant benefits to all the above application fields.  

The target and the sub-targets of the STAMP project may be summarized as follows.
• Separations with a peak capacity of 1,000,000 (through the use of spatial 3D-LC)
• Fast and efficient spatial 2D-LC separations
• Devices for spatial 2D-LC and 3D-LC
• Detection principles for spatial 2D-LC and 3D-LC

1. A simplified ED system that can be used for brackish water desalination (8 pilots in developing countries) or for tap-water softening (2 pilots in Germany and the Netherlands).
2. A multistage ED system for industrial-scale seawater desalination, which will be demonstrated to reach energy consumption as low as 1.5 kWh/m3 (1 pilot in the Netherlands)

Reduced costs and wider deployment, especially in the European market, have led over the past decade to its use at sea. Here the wind resource is larger and more constant, allowing higher unitary power turbines. However, the marine environment itself also imposes a number of restrictions and challenges. The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources are in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. 
Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact.
The aim of the NFLOW project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:1 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics. 
The design has been focused on 5MW machine, with the aim of reaching 8-10MW machines when available in the future. The already mounted prototypes have wind turbines installed of around 2MW, which prevented an optimization of structures.

Instead of disposal/landfilling – that regularly causes pollution of natural water resources – it would be more beneficial to produce sludge pellets. Such experiences drove us to create the InnoPellet technology, a self-supporting biofuel pellet producing system for treating communal sewage sludge that is economical in case of small scale production too. 

Five years of research and development led to the successful completion of a prototype machine that received regulatory approval and third-party testing/validation.

This is the case of many EU States. Because of issues related to decreasing ore grades and scarcity of supply of primary metal forms, recycling of above-ground deposits of metal-bearing waste (or “in-use stock”) will become an increasingly important means of securing resources to provide essential building blocks to the European industry. Recycling of metal in-use stock has the further potential of avoiding consuming the large amounts of energy required in primary metal production, and of reducing related greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, however, because of metal losses during and after use, end-of-life recycling rates for many metals are often very low, so the potential for improving those recycling efficiencies is an important consideration for the achievement of a more resource efficient economy and sustainable development in Europe. 
This project proposes a comprehensive, exemplary research line that merges complementary drivers in the assessment of the metal-energy-climate change nexus for (i) estimating the size of current urban mines for selected, critical metals; (ii) assessing future opportunities and barriers to their recycling, and (iii) related potentials for carbon emissions reduction.

This is expected to increase in the upcoming years as the amount of data processed in the cloud increases substantially. An effective way for data centers to achieve better performance and energy efficiency is to perform computation on specialized processing elements. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enable customization of logic after manufacturing to achieve better energy efficiency compared to general purpose processors. Today, prominent hardware and software companies are investing in data center solutions that integrate FPGAs with CPUs, and significant energy consumption and performance improvements have been demonstrated for several data center applications. However, the main barrier for wide spread adoption of FGPAs in data centers is the cost of programming, which typically requires months of development time by hardware designers. This makes it unaffordable for small-to-medium software companies to effectively utilize the available FPGAs. The purpose of this project is to lower this barrier for emerging graph analytics applications for knowledge discovery and machine learning. The basic idea is to use an abstract interface that allows a domain expert to describe an application as a set of serial functions defined per vertex and/or edge. We propose a customizable implementation template that automatically maps the abstract user functions to massively parallel FPGA implementations. The proposed template will hide from users many low level implementation details such as parallelization, pipelining, synchronization, memory access optimization, race and deadlock avoidance, etc. This will help bridge the gap between high level application descriptions and costly hardware implementations.

Furthermore, wastewater presents itself as a constant burden for industry, particularly wastewater containing nutrients that can potentially lead to a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) which damages aquatic ecosystems.

Critically, the water at the end of the process is purified and safe to be used as drinking water or for release into watercourses. The primary value of Eggplant is the reduction of waste from agri-food industrial wastewater from twofold to zero – filtration removes the majority of pollutants and fermentation removes organic contaminants.

Our vision is to become the world’s largest fast acting electricity load aggregator, controlling over 350 MW of load and creating Europe’s largest ‘virtual power plant’. This will allow us to grow our company from our current aggregated load of 50 MW, and our turnover of €4.5 million to €43 million per year by 2022.

Electricity systems in EU countries are facing significant challenges as penetration of renewable energy (in particular wind) continues to increase to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets. Due to the intermittent and inflexible nature of renewable energy sources, efficient real-time frequency balancing of grids will become a major challenge for grid operators. A deviation of only 1 Hz from the standard grid frequency (50 Hz) can cause blackouts and power outages as the grid loses inertia, requiring grid operators to quickly add/remove load from the grid to restore balance. 

Following our success with our current smart grid optimisation system we have seen an opportunity to introduce a disruptive new system, OptiGrid, which will use Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) to allow potentially problematic changes in grid frequency to be detected and acted upon within 0.4 seconds, rather than the 10-second state of the art. As well as providing grid security, this will also allow a greater quantity of renewable energy sources to be integrated into the grid as we will be able to effectively and rapidly deliver the required frequency response performance to grid operators.   

With the frequency response market expected to see imminent high growth, our technology is well placed to take a significant proportion of this target sector.

Such promising, yet underdeveloped technology needs fundamental breakthroughs in the development of efficient electrode catalysts, i.e. electrocatalysts, for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2-RR). In fact, none of the currently known catalysts has adequate efficiency.
In this project, I propose to investigate well-defined ruthenium oxide (RuOx) and molybdenum sulphide (MoSx) nano catalysts for the CO2-RR. The goal is to discover new, efficient catalysts on the basis of fundamental insight. In the first phase, model RuOx and MoSx catalysts (nanoparticles, thin films) will be investigated to elucidate the physicochemical parameters that control their performance. In the second phase, synthetic strategies will be applied to enhance the catalyst activity and selectivity; these will be based on the preparation of metal substituted RuOx and on the exploitation of catalyst-support interactions.
The proposed investigation is:
• Timely, given the relevance attributed by the European Union and by the chemical industry to the research on CO2 re-utilization strategies that involve the integration of renewable energy sources;
• Innovative. RuOx and MoSx are promising, yet largely unexplored catalysts for the CO2-RR. The strategies devised to enhance their performance are radically different from what has been proposed so far.
• Expected to provide high impact. The structure-activity descriptors identified through this study will open new perspectives for the design of efficient catalysts via controlled synthetic processes.

The heating industry is recognized as the sector with the biggest energy-saving potential in Europe. In the low temperature
range of -20 to \100°C, most of the thermal energy amounts are required and then discarded, in particular in our buildings
and industries. PCM are recognized among the key materials to save these huge energy and – at the same time – CO2
amounts. They can run through a reproducible phase-change at a substance-specific temperature, during which the thermal
energy is either stored in very large amounts or returned at a constant temperature. Since decades, an adequate method is
being sought to transfer PCM into a user-friendly form. Both existing micro- and macro-encapsulation solutions for PCM
storage have until now revealed not industrially and economically viable enough for a broad application. The most common
solution in use in Europe is sensible heat storage (e.g. water storage tank) that has a low energy density and thermal
storage capacity.

Energy harvesters convert different forms of environmental energies into electricity thus making devices self-powered. However, with over a decade’s development, energy harvesters have not been able to overtake batteries yet, although academia and industry are keen to apply it in electronics. One of the reasons is that the power level provided by a single-source energy harvester, which most research has been focused on, is not high or stable enough. Therefore, a crucial and urgent question has been raised – how to release the huge potential of energy harvesting technology? This proposed action is addressing the above scientific/engineering question by exploring multi-source energy harvesting on a single piece of material. Perovskite structured materials are able to exhibit piezoelectric, pyroelectric or photovoltaic effect which has been utilised to harvest kinetic, thermal or solar energy separately. This action will combine these three effects on the same perovskite for the first time ever. Solid-state reaction will be used to synthesise the materials; thick- and thin-films will be deposited through physical methods; the materials and films will be structurally analysed, multi-functionally evaluated and compositionally optimised, to establish new inter principles of kinetic-thermal-solar multi-harvesting. Such a research topic of multi-functional materials and devices is also a ‘‘roadmap’’ of the European Science Foundation. It will conduct an interdisciplinary research across piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and photovoltaics, and will require contributions from materials science, electronics and chemistry.

As demonstrated by experimental tests carried out together with the Engineering and Research Division of Enel S.p.a., the innovative technology developed by CalBatt (TRL 6) can allow:

o an efficiency increase of up to 15% compared to traditional management strategies, for any size and technology of the battery.

Initial rapid progress in the field of perovskite solar cells has slowed; efficiencies are not high enough to make them commercially attractive. Therefore, a step change is needed in how these devices are made. All perovskite solar cells so far are polycrystalline. The project will focus on solution-based epitaxial growth of single crystal perovskites, providing novel high quality thin films. These crystals will be incorporated into Si-based tandem solar cells, to form highly efficient single-crystal-on-single-crystal devices. Fabricating on top of an existing technology offers rapid commercialisation and significantly better power to cost ratio than existing technologies.

The project will comprise an outgoing phase in Prof. Michael McGehee’s group at Stanford University, whose unrivalled expertise in fabrication of hybrid tandem solar cells will be combined with the researcher’s skills to fabricate single crystal perovskite-on-Si solar cells. The expertise obtained will then be transferred to the group of Prof. Sir Richard Friend at the University of Cambridge, experts in photophysics. The physical mechanisms occurring in these devices will be elucidated via ultrafast spectroscopy.  Based on these findings, devices will be further improved to attain the highest efficiencies.

Stars like our Sun form when rotating dense cores, in the interstellar medium, collapse until they eventually reach temperatures at which nuclear fusion begins; while planets, including the Earth, form in the rotationally supported disks around these same young stars. One of the major challenges of modern astrophysics is the “angular momentum problem': observations show that a typical star-forming cloud needs to reduce its specific angular momentum by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude to form a typical star such as our Sun. It is also crucial to solve the angular momentum problem to understand the formation of protoplanetary disks, stellar binaries and the initial mass function of newly formed stars. Magnetic fields are one of the key ways of transporting angular momentum in astrophysical structures: understanding how angular momentum is transported to allow star formation requires characterizing the role of magnetic fields in shaping the dynamics of star-forming structures. The MagneticYSOs project aims at characterizing the role of magnetic field in the earliest stage of star formation, during the main accretion phase.
The simultaneous major improvements of instrumental and computational facilities provide us, for the first time, with the opportunity to confront observational information to magnetized models predictions. Polarization capabilities on the last generation of instrument in large facilities are producing sensitive observations of magnetic fields with a great level of detail, while numerical simulations of star formation are now including most of the physical ingredients for a detailed description of protostellar collapse at all the relevant scales, such as resistive MHD, radiative transfer and chemical networks. These new tools will undoubtedly lead to major discovery in the fields of planets and star formation in the coming years. It is necessary to conduct comprehensive projects able to combine theory and observations in a detailed fashion, which in turn require a collaboration with access to cutting edge observational datasets and numerical models. Through an ambitious multi-faceted program of dedicated observations probing magnetic fields (polarized dust emission and Zeeman effect maps), gas kinematics (molecular lines emission maps), ionization rates and dust properties in Class 0 protostars, and their comparison to synthetic observations of MHD simulations of protostellar collapse, we aim to transform our understanding of:
1) The long-standing problem of angular momentum in star formation
2) The origin of the stellar initial mass function
3) The formation of multiple stellar systems and circumstellar disks around young stellar objects (YSOs)
Not only this project will enable a major leap forward in our understanding of low-mass star formation, answering yet unexplored questions with innovative methods, but it will also allow to spread the expertise in interpreting high-angular resolution (sub-)mm polarization data. Although characterizing magnetic fields in astrophysical structures represents the next frontier in many fields (solar physics, evolved stars, compact objects, galactic nuclei are a few examples), only a handful of astronomers in the EU community are familiar with interferometric polarization data, mostly because of the absence of large european facilities providing such capabilities until the recent advent of ALMA. It is now crucial to strengthen the European position in this research field by training a new generation of physicists with a strong expertise on tailoring, analyzing and interpreting high angular resolution polarization data.'",1500000.0,1500000.0,ERC-2015-STG,ERC-STG,COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES,FR,,,

However, to this day, most wave energy R&D does not have access to open-sea operating data as they are not shared by the companies that sponsored open-sea tests. 

OPERA will remove this roadblock by collecting and sharing two years of open-sea operating data of a floating oscillating water column wave energy converter. In addition the project will be the first open-sea deployment for four cost-reducing innovations that will be advanced from TRL3-4 to TRL5. Together, these four innovations have a long-term cost reduction potential of over 50%.

The liberalization is expected to increase competition and thus increase cost-efficiency in energy production, transmission and distribution with the result of decreasing electricity prices. The efforts of Member State governments to create a more competitive and sustainable electricity sector are currently clouded by a major economic downturn in Europe´s economic activity. Such economic hardship often triggers reluctance to change which is becoming visible in particular in the electricity sector, where measures to protect jobs and national industry start to compete with market liberalization. The affordability of sustainable electricity is questioned.

There is a strong need for innovative business models for Renewable Energy Source (RES) electricity generation in the long and mid-term because support schemes will fade out in the long term pushing renewables on the market at no marginal costs which then in particular for strongly correlated generation as wind and PV leads to price deterioration during production hours.

To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:

(1) High energy efficiency and density;
(2) Small size and low weight;
(3) High reliability;
(4) Compliance with existing standards and regulation; and
(5) High cost-efficiency.

Any energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.

Worldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.

With its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.",1264025.0,996465.5,H2020-COMPET-2015,RIA,"CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION COOPERATIVA DE ENERGIAS ALTERNATIVAS FUNDACION, CIC ENERGIGUNE FUNDAZIOA",ES,FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION;GOMSPACE SWEDEN AB;GENCOA LIMITED,ES;SE;UK,

What POROUS4APP project will bring to the European community is the development of new metal/metal-oxide doped-nanoporous carbonaceous materials based on a known technology. This technology needs to be upscaled and modified to enable a full flexibility of the material characteristics to be applied to various industrial applications. 
The use of abundant renewable resources like starch has been proven to be a low cost and reliable raw material source for industrial production of carbonaceous materials having porosity in the nanometer range. In POROUS4APP it will be intended to produce not only carbonaceous nanoporous materials but carbonaceous material with enhanced functionality by using impregnation and sol/gel strategy.

It is estimated that flame retardants have reduced the number of fire deaths by 20% in the past 20 years, despite the considerable increase in the number of electronic devices in homes.

However, these flame retardants have traditionally been based on chlorinated and brominated substances that have negative impacts on human health and the environment and have subsequently been banned for electronic applications in Europe. 

Green alternatives that have been put forward are either expensive, compromise the mechanical properties of the plastics produced or have poor flame retardant performance. This has also meant that the market penetration of bioplastics has been limited, partiocualrly in the automobile and consumer electronics markets, as there is no cost effective, high performance, green flame retardant that maintains mechanical properties in the market.

As part of an EU financed project, BRIGIT, Daren Laboratories & Scientific Consultants Ltd has synthetized a series of novel and effective FR bio-additive (LS-FR) using modified lignosulfonate, a by-product of the acid digestion of wood in the chemical pulping industry. LS-FR has been validated in durable bioplastics: polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) and polybutylene succinate (PBS).

LS-FR is an effective and bio-based FR which offers for the first time, the possibility of an FR bioplastic which meets the FRs standards for the consumer electronics and automobile sectors, while maintaining adequate mechanical properties.

Market analysts estimate a compound annual growth rate of 18,7% and a total of 5,4 GW installed worldwide between 2013 and 2019. One of the main drivers for BIPV market growth in the EU is the increasingly demanding legislation related to energy performance in buildings. The large potential for energy savings in buildings led the EU Commission to adopt the 2010/31/EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings with the objective that all new buildings are Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) by 2020. Renewable energy technologies, and in particular the integration of photovoltaic systems in the building environment offer many possibilities to play a key role within the NZEB scenario. 

Despite this favorable framework for BIPV technology market uptake, initial estimations of BIPV market growth have been subsequently overestimated in the past few years. A series of demands from the stakeholders which have not been properly addressed by the BIPV value chain are the cause for this deviation. These key requirements are mainly related to the flexibility in design and aesthetics considerations, lack of tools integrating PV and building performance, demonstration of long-term reliability of the technology, compliance with legal regulations, smart interaction with the grid and cost effectiveness. Within this context:

The objective of PVSITES project is to drive BIPV technology to a large market deployment by demonstrating an ambitious portfolio of building-integrated solar technologies and systems, giving a forceful, reliable answer to the market requirements identified by the industrial members of the consortium in their day-to-day activity.

This industry is a strategic sector in the EU economy, actively contributing to the re-industrialisation of Europe. Currently, the production of paper and board in the EU is 91 tonnes per year, while PfR represents 63%. The contribution of PfR has increased over the last few years (from 25 t to 40 t).
This increase in the availability of PfR has not taken place in all EU states, and this is especially true in Eastern European countries. Besides, although high collection rates are achieved, the quality of this material does not always meet the requirements of paper recycling. Both facts make difficult to keep up with the increases in PfR collection rates observed over the last few years if specific actions are not taken.
IMPACTPapeRec aims to put Europe at the forefront of PfR collection, ensuring raw material procurement from mainly European sources through an innovative approach based on the participation of the whole paper value chain including citizens and municipalities, which is also open to other sectors.

• Increasing the biomass supply by developing a rotating crop scheme for cultivation of seaweed, using native, highly productive brown, red and green seaweeds. Combined with the use of advanced textile substrates these breakthroughs will result in a year round biomass yield of 25 kg seaweeds (wet weight) per m2 per year harvested at 1000m2/hr;
• Improving the pre-treatment and storage of seaweed and to yield fermentable and convertible sugars at economically relevant concentrations (10-30%);
• Increasing the bio-ethanol production to economically viable concentrations of > 4%/l and;
• Increasing the bio-butanol yield to 15 g./l by developing novel fermenting organisms which metabolize all sugars at 90% efficiency for ethanol and butanol;
• Increasing the biogas yield to convert 90% of the available carbon in the residues by adapting the organisms to seaweed;
• Developing the thermochemical conversion of sugars to fuels from the mg. scale to the kg. scale;
• Performing an integral techno-economic, sustainability and risk assessment of the entire seaweed to biofuel chain.

The project addresses market uptake challenges for a wider use of district heating and cooling systems (DHC) with high shares of RES, specifically the action focuses on the use of large-scale solar thermal plants combined with other RES in DHC systems.
The key approach of the project is to develop, improve and implement in 9 participating EU regions advanced policies and support measures for SDH. In 3 focus regions Thuringia (DE), Styria (AT) and Rhone-Alpes (FR) the regulating regional authorities are participating as project partners to ensure a strong implementation capacity within the project. In 6 follower regions from BG, DE, IT, PL, SE the regulating authorities are engaged through letters of commitment. The project activities aim at a direct mobilization of investments in SDH and hence a significant market rollout.
The project work program in the participating regions follows a process including 1) strategy and action planning based on a survey, best practices and stakeholder consultation 2) an implementation phase starting at an early project stage and 3) efficient dissemination of the project results at national and international level.
Adressed market uptake challenges are: Improved RES DHC policy, better access to plant financing and business models, sustained public acceptance and bridging the gap between policy and market through market support and capacity building. Denmark and Sweden reached already today a high share of RES in DHC and shall be used as a role model for this project.

Solar power offers a virtually unlimited supply of energy, providing it can be harnessed efficiently. Traditional silicon solar cells demonstrate high performance (~20%) but their required method of manufacture prohibits large area production rendering them too expensive to be used on a global scale. Organic solar cells (made from conjugated polymers and fullerenes) have the potential to be fabricated by low cost printing methods allowing for large scale modules to be produced cheaply. Conventional organic solar cells function by generating charge from a singlet excited state. In order to achieve optimum performance the precise morphology of polymer and fullerene must be controlled which can be extremely challenging. These devices however, have attained good efficiencies (10%) but are hampered by severe loss mechanisms which generally involve the formation of a lower energy triplet excited state. 

We propose to develop novel materials for organic solar cells which will instead utilise this triplet excited state to generate charges. This will enable us to not only eliminate this loss mechanism but due to the unique properties of the triplet excited state will allow for numerous benefits. Firstly, the long lifetime of the triplet excited state will be exploited to allow for a simpler organic solar cell where precise morphological control is not required. Secondly, the proposed new materials will allow for the utilisation of near-IR light which is typically wasted in ALL current solar cell devices. Thirdly, exploiting a unique photophysical process we will produce materials capable of delivering efficiencies in excess of the theoretical limit available to conventional solar cells. Thus we propose that utilisation of triplet excitons is the required step-change to allow for organic solar cells to achieve their ultimate efficiencies",1025999.26,1025999.26,ERC-2015-STG,ERC-STG,THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARSOF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,UK,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,UK,

Butanol is one of the most promising biofuels due to its superior fuel properties compared to current main biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel. In addition to its ability to reduce carbon emissions, its higher energy content (almost 30% more than ethanol), its ability to blend with both gasoline and diesel, its lower risk of separation and corrosion, its resistance to water absorption, allowing it to be transported in pipes and carriers used by gasoline, it offers a very exciting advantage for adoption as engines require almost no modifications to use it.  

The main WASTE2FUELS innovations include:

•    Development of novel pretreatment methods for converting AFW to an appropriate feedstock for biobutanol production thus dramatically enlarging current available biomass for biofuels production
•    Genetically modified microorganisms for enhancing conversion efficiencies of the biobutanol fermentation process
•    Coupled recovery and biofilm reactor systems for enhancing conversion efficiencies of Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation
•    Development of new routes for biobutanol production via ethanol catalytic conversion
•    Biobutanol engine tests and ecotoxicological assessment of the produced biobutanol
•    Valorisation of the process by-products 
•    Development of an integrated model to optimise the waste-to-biofuel conversion and facilitate the industrial scale-up
•    Process fingerprint analysis by environmental and techno-economic assessment
•    Biomass supply chain study and design of a waste management strategy for rural development

The amount of electric power which can be supplied to the grid depends on the time of the day and weather conditions. A conventional fleet of thermal power plants is required to compensate for these fluctuations before large scale energy storage technologies will be mature and economically viable. All power market projections expect this to be the case for the next 50 years at least. For a strong expansion of renewables, this fleet has to operate flexibly at competitive cost.
Current power plants cannot fill this role immediately without impeding their efficiency and engine lifetime through increased wear and damage induced by the higher number of (shorter) operating/loading cycles. New technologies need to be introduced to  balance demand peaks with renewable output fluctuations at minimal fuel consumption and emissions without negative effects on cycling operation. The FLEXTURBINE partners have developed a medium to long term technology roadmap addressing future and existing power plants. The FLEXTURBINE project presented hereafter is the first step in such technology roadmap and consists of: (1) new solutions for extended operating ranges to predict and control flutter, (2) improved sealing and bearing designs to increase turbine lifetime and efficiency by reducing degradation/damages, and (3) an improved lifecycle management through better control and prediction of critical parts to improve competitive costs by more flexible service intervals and planned downtime, and by reducing unplanned outages. In all areas, individual technologies will be developed from TRL 3 to TRL 4-6.

District cooling (DC) can play a part in satisfying this demand in a sustainable way (since can offer 5 to 10 times higher efficiency solutions than on‐site stand‐alone distributed systems). Even if DC captures only minor portion of the prospective market, this will translate into a dramatic increase in the size of the global DC sector.
INDIGO aims to develop a more efficient, intelligent and cheaper generation of DC systems by improving system planning, control and management, anticipating the aforementioned scenario. This target will be achieved through the following specific objectives:
• Contribute to the wider use of DC systems and motivate the competiveness of European DC market by the development of two open-source tools:
o A planning tool for DC systems with the aim of supporting their optimal design
o A library with thermo-fluid dynamic models of DC System components which will provide the designers detailed information about their physical behaviour
• Primary energy reduction over 45% addressed by a ground breaking DC system management strategy focused mainly on energy efficiency maximization but also on energy cost minimization. Its main characteristics is the predictive management but it also will address other challenges such as:
o Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
o Dealing with different types of cooling sources 
o Suitable coupling between generation, storage and demand
All this, with the help of intelligent and innovative component controllers (Predictive Controllers) to be developed at all DC system levels. Some of them include embedded self-learning algorithms, allowing components to respond appropriately to the set-points established.

Under the UN-REDD\ program, donor countries can compensate for some of their C emissions by implementing projects that will reduce C emissions by a known amount in developing countries. Operationally, only C emissions due to deforestation are being estimated in REDD\ projects due to the lack of definition of forest degradation and of thresholds for distinguishing between forest degradation and disturbance due to sustainable forest management practices. No worldwide estimates of the extent of forest degradation have yet been made, and large amounts of C emissions may occur in some degraded areas still being classified as forests. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to produce an operational definition of forest degradation in the context of REDD\ projects. A new approach that considers a single reference condition (but dependent on site conditions) for assessing the occurrence and extent of forest degradation will be developed.

Nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly influence ecosystem functions and services. However, few experimental tests have examined the influences of invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionally strong impacts on native ecosystems. Invasive earthworms are a prime example of ecosystem engineers that influence many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworms invading northern North American forests may cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services like carbon sequestration. Using a synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on relationships between plant communities, soil food webs, and ecosystem processes. Further, effects of a changing climate on the spread and consequences of earthworm invasion will be investigated. Meta-analyses will be used to test if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differ from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground–belowground perspective. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity–ecosystem function research.",1498620.0,1498620.0,ERC-2015-STG,ERC-STG,UNIVERSITAET LEIPZIG,DE,,,

This fellowship will bring an excellent young researcher (Dr Jing Li), the winner of Springer Thesis Prize and Excellent PhD Graduate Award of the President of Chinese Academy of Sciences, to investigate a medium temperature photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system incorporated with the coupled thermal storage/organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as a novel alternative to battery. Due to its unique positive power temperature coefficient, the efficiency of amorphous silicon (a-Si) cell can be higher than that of a crystalline silicon (c-Si) cell when the operating temperature is above 100°C, at which heat is able to drive the ORC. This has therefore stimulated the applicants to propose the a-Si PVT-ORC system which combines the respective advantages of PV and solar ORC technologies. The a-Si PVT-ORC system is estimated to have an overall electrical efficiency up to 12.8% at 120°C, which is comparable to the c-Si PVT system at 75°C, but the former can eliminate expensive battery and use the coupled thermal storage/ORC instead, offering more economic and environmental benefits.
The proposed project will offer an excellent opportunity of training and development for the very promising young researcher. The project has been carefully designed to match Dr Li’s expertise in solar thermal power systems and the expertise of the University of Nottingham in CHP, BiPV, CFD and 3D printing technologies, and thus facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer.

Currently they own over 1,500 sows that produce a combined total of 37,000 pigs per year. The pig farming industry is significant across Europe and it is increasingly becoming more and more difficult for pig farmers to be profitable and competitive. There are numerous legislations that are inhibiting the ability for pig farmers to prosper. Regulations and targets in place to control pollution and contamination are leaving pig farmers with less and less economical use for pig slurry. Pig herds are constantly growing and the slurry amounts are quickly reaching a crisis point. In order to improve margins and remain in business pig farmers require an innovative solution. We have developed a novel and innovative microwave pre-treatment technology that increases the compatibility of pig slurry for anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of pig slurry is currently economically unviable as there is a requirement to add organic carbon sources in the ratio of 8:1. The microwave pre-treatment process converts hard carbon in the slurry, which cannot be digested by bacteria, into soluble carbon, thus increasing the total bio-available carbon in the slurry and improving the Carbon:Nitrogen ratio. Therefore the costs of using AD with pig slurry, are extremely high. Our innovative pre-treatment technology removes the need to add organic material and increases the biogas yield from slurry by 20%. This therefore provides farmers with a realistic solution to deal with the ever-growing amounts of slurry produced. With a payback of 4 years, our biowave system provides an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective method for pig slurry treatment that eases farmers’ legislative burdens.

The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Sustainable Animal Production (CWG-SAP). 
Funding organisations from 22 European countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the development of a Common Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Sustainable Animal Production. 
The animal production sector forms an important part of Europe’s (agricultural) economy and plays an essential role in the provision of Europe`s citizens with high quality animal products. Like other agriculture sectors, animal production faces many challenges from projected increases in global demand for food, climate change, competition for natural resources and economic volatility. The European animal production landscape is very complex, consisting of different species farmed within a wide range of different extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems using multiple resources to produce a diverse range of animal products and other services. Partners in this ERA-NET believe, however, that these challenges and complexities can be effectively addressed through joint European research within a framework which supports the three pillars of sustainability - economy, environment and society - and targets opportunities for innovative research spanning all areas of animal production such as health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, breeding and genetics, housing, nutrient management and economics. Partners in ERA-NET SusAn endorse scientific excellence and recommend an integrated, interdisciplinary, cross-cutting and multi-actor approach to research and knowledge exchange which reflects the complexity of the research requirements for sustainable European animal production.",15983750.0,5000000.0,H2020-ISIB-2015-1,ERA-NET-Cofund,Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung,DE,"NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK;MAAELUMINISTEERIUM;FONDS FLANKEREND ECONOMISCH EN INNOVATIEBELEID;CENTRO PARA EL DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO INDUSTRIAL.;ELIKA NEKAZARITZAKO ELIKAGAIEN SEGURTASUNARAKO EUSKAL FUNDAZIOA;MINISTERSTVO PODOHOSPODARSTVA A ROZVOJA VIDIEKA SLOVENSKEJ REPUBLIKY;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS;MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY;ELLINIKOS GEORGIKOS ORGANISMOS - DIMITRA;FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH;MINISTERO DELLE POLITICHE AGRICOLE ALIMENTARI E FORESTALI;MINISTRSTVO ZA KMETIJSTVO GOZDARSTVO IN  PREHRANO;TURKIYE BILIMSEL VE TEKNOLOJIK ARASTIRMA KURUMU;SERVICE PUBLIC DE WALLONIE;INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACION Y TECNOLOGIA AGRARIA Y ALIMENTARIA OA MP;VALSTS IZGLITIBAS ATTISTIBAS AGENTURA;MINISTERIE VAN ECONOMISCHE ZAKEN EN KLIMAAT;MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA, INDUSTRIA Y COMPETITIVIDAD;EIGEN VERMOGEN VAN HET INSTITUUT VOOR LANDBOUW- EN VISSERIJONDERZOEK;FORSKNINGSRÅDET FÖR MILJÖ, AREELLA NÄRINGAR OCH SAMHÄLLSBYGGANDE;LIETUVOS SVEIKATOS MOKSLU UNIVERSITETAS;TEAGASC - AGRICULTURE AND FOOD DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY;UNITED KINGDOM RESEARCH AND INNOVATION;NORGES FORSKNINGSRAD;Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz;LIETUVOS RESPUBLIKOS ZEMES UKIO MINISTERIJA;BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL;VLAAMSE GEWEST;Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Danish AgriFish Agency;DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND THE MARINE;BUNDESMINISTERIUM FUER NACHHALTIGKEIT UND TOURISMUS;INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT;MINISTERO DELLA SALUTE;SLOVENSKA AKADEMIA VIED;AGENCE NATIONALE DE LA RECHERCHE;NARODOWE CENTRUM BADAN I ROZWOJU;FUNDACAO PARA A CIENCIA E A TECNOLOGIA",NL;EE;BE;ES;SK;UK;FI;EL;DE;IT;SI;TR;LV;SE;LT;IE;NO;DK;AT;FR;PL;PT,

Recent initiatives to upgrade power systems into smart grids target an even tighter integration with information technologies to enable the integration of renewable energy sources, local and bulk generation and demand response. To fully estimate the security of an enterprise’s system architecture, a large number of issues must be considered. Enterprise systems security managers must be able to assess how vulnerabilities in one system influence vulnerabilities in other systems. In addition, security managers must be able to assess how individual vulnerabilities influence the security of the entire system of systems, given the protection solutions that are used in different locations in the architecture. The project will deliver and validate a tool that helps to 1) better understand current cyber security levels across complex enterprise-wide architectures, including relationships and interdependencies between systems, 2) prioritize areas to address and cyber security investments to pursue and 3) proactively manage cyber security e.g. when building or modifying architectures. The solution is based on a cybersecurity metamodel that 1) describes the qualitative structure (which assets, attacks and defences that should be included, and how these should be associated and 2) populates this qualitative structure with quantitative data (how likely different attacks are to succeed given the system parameter values and the presence or absence of different defences, using Bayesian networks). The tool generates a vulnerability “heat map” for each system configuration, allowing a user-friendly and visual comparison of the different alternatives.

The actual fossil fuels sources cannot assure the future energetic consumption. Studying new methodologies to exploit renewable energetic sources is therefore of utmost importance. The solar energy will have a crucial role in the energetic solution since it is the renewable source with the highest energy reaching the Earth crust. 

The scientific aim of this action, R2R-3G, is to increase the efficiency-cost ratio of photovoltaic technology. For this purpose, this project plans to exploit both the high efficiency of third generation (3G) solar cells, and the low cost fabrication methods based on roll-to-roll (R2R) processes. Part of the innovation of R2R-3G project lies in a methodological approach that makes compatible the flexibility of the devices required for roll-to-roll processes with the up-scaling of nanowire solar cells. The experienced researcher, Dr. Romero-Gomez, has a vast knowledge in the use of nanotechnology for modifying the solar cell architecture. The societal aim of R2R-3G is to assure the sustainability of the future energetic consumption using technologies that are respectful with the environment. 

The multidisciplinary perspective adopted, combining nanotechnology, material science, photonics, physics, and chemistry, ultimately aims to provide useful solutions to assure the future global energetic demand. In this way, this proposal directly addresses the challenge “Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy” in Horizon 2020 program. R2R-3G project will reinforce the European role in photovoltaic industry and decrease its excessive energetic import, which currently is more than 50% of its energy consumption making it vulnerable to external suppliers.",187419.6,187419.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2015,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE,CH,,,

Small wind can play an important role in meeting this challenge by providing reliable decentralized renewable energy. However, there are a number of technical and economic barriers the small wind industry needs to overcome in order to become fully competitive. These include low performances in urban environments with slow and turbulent winds, high noise levels, need for reliable safety systems to avoid over-speeding, risks to birds and high upfront investments for the purchase and installation of the technology. 

Existing market solutions only cover a certain range of wind speeds and have low performances in slow winds. They also cause uncomfortable noise with levels that can reach 60dBA - above WHO standards (40 – 55 dBA) - while posing a collision hazard for birds during flight. In economic terms, the average final installed costs of a small wind turbine are around €10,000 to €15,000. 

SEESWIND is the first technology in the small wind market that offers solutions to cover the full range of winds and user demands thanks to its modular and easy to install (plug & play) configuration, ensuring a silent (0 dBA), efficient and safe performance while reducing by 10-40% the overall final cost for the user. SEESWIND’s feasibility study will aim at exploring our commercial strategy, including the definition of modules with highest commercial interest,  technical feasibility and markets analyses, as well as a ‘freedom to operate’ study, in order to define our SEESWIND business plan.

considered:
- Cities are the customer: considering local specificities in integrated urban plans and the need to develop monitoring
systems to extract conclusions for replication.
- Solutions must be replicable, interoperable and scalable.
REPLICATE considers also the complexity of cities, the tangible benefits for citizens, the financial mechanisms and the new
business models. The 3 pillars implemented in the pilots with the engagement of citizens, private actors and authorities are:
- Low energy districts: cost-effective retrofitting, new constructive techniques with optimal energy behaviour and high
enthalpy RES in residential buildings. Include also efficient measures in public and residential buildings: ICT tools, PV,
shading or natural ventilation; district heating is demonstrated hybridising local biomass, recovered heat and natural gas.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.
The intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.
The Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.
The CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.
CryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.",8269770.99,7045594.38,H2020-LCE-2015-3,IA,LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY LBG,UK,"NV MAYEKAWA EUROPE SA;INSTITUT INTERNATIONAL DU FROID;THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM;EUREC EESV;INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES ET TECHNOLOGIES POUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT ET L'AGRICULTURE;INSTITUTE OF REFRIGERATION;PSUTEC SPRL;FUNDACION CENER;DOHMEYER CONSTRUCTION SPOLKA Z ORGANICZONA ODPOWIEDZIALNOSCIA;CARBON DATA RESOURCES LTD;INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE POUR L'AGRICULTURE, L'ALIMENTATION ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT;ITP NV;CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY;TPG DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY LIMITED;L AIR LIQUIDE SA;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA;FRIGOLOGIX",BE;FR;UK;ES;PL;BG,

Due to their efficient generation and local use of heat and electricity, their fuel saving- and CO2 reduction potential is tremendous. In spite of great interest of the market and policy-makers, currently available mCHP systems suffer from limited life, high investment and very high maintenance cost, making them too expensive for serious market uptake. 
MTT solves this problem with the EnerTwin, a mCHP system based on a micro gas turbine. The EnerTwin uses commercial off-the-shelf components resulting in low investment cost. Gas turbines are known for low-maintenance, high power density (small size) and long life. MTT uses automotive turbochargers as key components of the turbine: these are produced in millions and contribute to the low cost and high reliability of the EnerTwin. Gas turbines are inherently insensitive to varying fuel compositions facilitating use of various grades of natural gas. 
Currently, the EnerTwin is at TLR 7: 19 systems have been deployed in 1st-stage field tests at client locations since mid 2013. Besides the field-trial units, MTT has already sold 500 commercial EnerTwins, which promises an excellent commercial market perspective, while concrete contracts are under negotiation for high volumes for Canadian- and Chinese markets. 
The main objective of this project is the readiness for commercialisation of the EnerTwin. MTT and its industrial project partners will improve the mCHP to meet future CE and ECO Design requirements. Together with these partners, MTT will work on component and system optimisation for reliability and large-volume manufacturing.

UMINHO seeks to improve the multifunctionality of natural-origin polymers, often with limited bioactivity and stimuli-responsiveness, and increase the performance of cell-based therapies. Introducing such properties by precision chemical modifications would allow the development of added-value products with instructive and adaptive properties for cellular response control, drug delivery and diagnosis. The main goal of CHEM2NATURE is to combat UMINHO’s limited knowledge, expertise and experience on advanced chemical routes for biopolymer, biomaterials and “living” surface modification. To this aim, an international training and scientific network will be established to accelerate the generation of technologies amenable to be used in the production of innovative healthcare devices. The capability of UMINHO to train highly-qualified researchers and staff would greatly increase, giving rise to a new generation of specialized professionals with scientific/translational competence. The consortium will comprise UMINHO, UAVR and 3 international competitive institutions in Chemistry: 2 European and 1 Asian. The latter will improve UMINHO’s know-how in the translational/clinical fields and raise opportunities to establish new contacts with high-performing and Emerging Asian countries. CHEM2NATURE proposes the joint organisation of events and short-term exchange of senior researchers and staff, aiming at training actions and execution of scientific work in the scope of ongoing scientific projects.

In particular, ABRA actions will focus on the creation of a substantial increase of the real estate value of the existing buildings through a significant energy and architectural transformation. The central goals of the proposal consist of an important reduction of the pay back time of the interventions, a strengthening of the key investors’ confidence, increasing quality and attractiveness of the existing buildings’ stock and, finally, reaching a concrete market acceleration towards the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings target. The actual investment gap in the deep renovation sector is due to the fact that high investments are required up-front and they are generally characterised by an excessively high degree of risk and long payback times. It is therefore necessary to develop harmonized, concerted and innovative actions to unlock the needed public and private funds, fill the energy efficiency investment gap and ultimately contribute to re-launch the construction market and create new jobs. Therefore, ABRA aims at demonstrating to the key stakeholders and financial investors the attractiveness of a new renovation strategy based on AdoRe, intended as one (or a set of) Assistant Building unit(s) - like aside or façade addictions, rooftop extensions or even an entire new building construction - that adopt the existing buildings (the Assisted Buildings).  The creation of these new Assistant Buildings’ Additions integrated with Renewable Energy Sources aims at reducing the initial investment allocated for the deep renovation of the existing building creating an up-grading synergy between old and new.

Even small changes in source or sink strength are expected to have a rapid impact on the atmospheric CH4 concentration, making CH4 an excellent candidate for short-term climate change mitigation strategies. However, this mitigation potential can only be accessed if we can accurately quantify all sinks and sources contributing to the global CH4 budget. One of the poorly understood aspects of the global CH4 budget is the effect of land-use change and soil management on the CH4 budget of soils which themselves can be either sinks or sources of atmospheric CH4. The central drawback in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling net soil CH4 fluxes is our insufficient knowledge on gross CH4 fluxes and the involved organisms. The project “CH4ScarabDetect” aims to provide the first quantitative estimate of the importance of soil-dwelling cockchafer larvae for net soil CH4 fluxes. These important European agricultural and forest pests are qualitatively known to emit CH4, but have thus far been neglected in terrestrial CH4 cycle research. To reach its aim, “CH4ScarabDetect” will develop a new non-invasive field monitoring method for separating gross CH4 production and gross CH4 oxidation in soils in general, and for detecting larvae infestations in particular, by combining for the very first time the well-known chamber flux method with a 13CH4 isotope pool dilution technique and acoustic measurements of larvae sounds. This novel approach will not only further our understanding of the role of cockchafer larvae in the terrestrial CH4 cycle and provide a new tool for soil CH4 flux and soil insect studies, but promises to also improve the monitoring of cockchafer infestations, thus generating new knowledge of major relevance for both scientific and practical reasons.",171460.8,171460.8,H2020-MSCA-IF-2015,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,HOCHSCHULE GEISENHEIM,DE,,,

As the region’s largest country, Poland’s continuing economic progress has not come without significant costs; due to its history in electricity production, in 2009 it had the highest rate of production by coal of any EU member state. This makes Poland Europe’s third largest polluter in terms of damage to society, home to six of Europe’s 30 most damaging power-plants, and to be among Europe’s worst for public exposure to harmful pollution.  At the same time it is experiencing rises in domestic electricity demand twice the EU average.

Resonant metal nanostructures, such as gold or silver nanoparticles, support localized surface plasmon resonances upon light illumination. These are free electron oscillations coupled to the electromagnetic field that enable light concentration even beyond the diffraction limit. For this reason plasmonics is a key tool for guiding and focusing light in order to extend the use of optical techniques into the nanoscale, with current and potential applications ranging from ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensor devices to imaging, non-linear optics or enhanced light absorption in photovoltaic cells.

On the other hand, the study of topological phases and protected states in solid state systems as well as in photonic crystals has been very successful in recent years, since electronic or photonic states protected by the global symmetries of the system can propagate without suffering from scattering at defects or disorder. This has raised interest both from a fundamental point of view, with new physics being developed and understood –such as topological insulators–, as well as with views to applied technologies, which would greatly benefit from dissipation-free transport of electrons or photons. 

While the field of plasmonics has reached a mature state, the performance of some plasmonic devices is affected by ohmic losses in the metal and fabrication defects. Novel and improved functionalities are needed in order to design efficient plasmonic devices. This research aims at adding novel capabilities to the field of plasmonics by designing topologically protected light modes sustained by plasmonic nanostructures.

It follows on from the first DemoWind initiative that launched in 2014 and, like its predecessor, is focussed on enabling industry, through partnership, to push technologies through TRLs 5-6 to 6-7 in transnationally funded projects.  We aim to connect existing and new European offshore wind demonstration opportunities, exchange knowledge and facilitate the acceleration of cost reducing innovative technologies to commercialisation.
This action will contribute to European cost reduction targets for offshore wind, economic development of the European offshore wind sector and help to maintain the EU’s internationally leading position in offshore wind.  Reducing technology cost is essential to increasing the deployment of offshore wind, making a significant contribution to the EU’s climate change targets, replacing aging fossil burning power plants with affordable energy. 

The main objectives of the DemoWind  2 project are split into two parts:
•Part A is dedicated to activities related to the main co-funded Call (Work Packages 1-5)
•Part B is dedicated to additional activities (Work Packages 6-7), which will be aimed at widening the dissemination of technologies supported by DemoWind 2 and at identifying and taking forward further opportunities for the DemoWind 2 partners and others to fund further RD&D activities targeting cost reduction in offshore wind without Commission funding.

• Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels 
• Reduce emissions of small particles
• Develop soft mobility 

Your mobile phone’s range is (barely) one day. But a few times a year you travel, and need longer range. The solution is modularity. Would you carry a much heavier and more expensive phone everyday just for occasional peak usage? (although it would be technically easy to manufacture). We all take a charger, or an external battery when traveling. And whenever battery technology makes progress, it’s for the benefit of size, weight and cost.

The range of an electric vehicle is enough for daily usage. But a few times a year you travel, and need longer range. Modularity is a solution as well. Few would choose to drive a much larger and more expensive car everyday just for occasional peak usage (regardless of technical feasibility). Let’s also use on demand mobile energy modules when traveling, providing unlimited range. Battery technology progress will result in leaner and cheaper EVs, with more payload and less taxpayer support. Meanwhile the EV market can grow at an accelerated pace as EV usability becomes identical to ICE vehicles, with the same affordability.

EP Tender is an on demand range extending service for electric vehicles, using mobile energy modules attached occasionally to the EV. The project presented here is to make a field test in France, and tests in Germany and China. It is supported by future potential clients having committed to participate to the pilot, and operating well over 2 000 electric vehicles. User acceptance is already proving excellent among EV owners and prospects. The field test will further evidence user demand, create strong dissemination momentum, and widen OEM support.

Laboratory tests will include the determination of parameters such as elastic constants, permeability and cohesion of the rocks as well as jetting experiments into large samples in. Samples will be investigated in 3D with micro CT scanners and with standard microscopy approaches. In addition, advanced modelling will help understand the actual mechanism leading to the rock destruction at the tip of the water jet.

This has created a major market opportunity for new technologies that achieve high purity of sorted materials at a low cost.

ZenRobotics Oy has developed a robotic waste sorting system ZenRobotics Recycler (ZRR) that has the potential to revolutionise waste sorting, replacing low-performing hazardous manual jobs with highly efficient and fast autonomous robotic pickers. The key innovation of ZRR is a unique machine-learning based system, which gathers gigabytes of data of its environment, makes smart decisions and moves a robot arm in an unpredictable environment. Given the novelty of the technology, a paradigm shift is necessary in waste management for wide uptake of ZRR.

The Robolution project develops the prototype ZRR into a reliable and commercially attractive system for sorting Commercial and Industrial waste that forms more that 25% of total waste stream. The project focuses on:
• Robot motion control to be able sort faster smaller objects and pick larger and heavier objects.
• Recognition to detect new fractions (plastics, ferrous/non-ferrous metals) with 95% purity and recovery.
• Development of the reporting tool enabling optimization within a waste sorting plant.
• Optimization of the ZRR commissioning and service to shorten time-to-market time.
• Testing and demonstration of the new functionality in real life conditions.

Afterwards, if the client is happy he will continue to buy the energy, otherwise we can take the system back and re-deploy it (i.e. use it again at a different user’s site). This highly innovative commercial approach, made possible by the technological breakthrough of the system’s re-deployability, will boost market penetration.
We will demonstrate the soundness of the proposed business concept by implementing - at real industrial sites in target geographic segments - two distinct pilot installations of approx. 2’500 m2 of net collecting surface (i.e. more than 1MWt) each, one with Fresnel and one with parabolic collectors.
Market replication will be pursued by means of active communication to other potential users, and also to institutional and financial stakeholders. These communications will be used to expand Soltigua’s reach in its 7 already identified target market segments and will generate useful input to the finalisation of our investor-ready business plan.",2893152.75,2025206.93,H2020-SMEINST-2-2015,SME-2,SOLTIGUA  SRL,IT,,,

This accumulation of data are elaborated and redirected within data centers with a continuous growing of traffic congestion. The continuous growth of traffic require therefore a roadmap of bandwidth density growth that necessarily has to be scalable on the timeframe of several years. To this point photonics plays a crucial role that is always more pervasive. However a major limiting factor is also arising from the energy cost and latency accumulated by the need of aggregation to route signals. To limitate this effect is necessary to make possible data exchange and processing without or with limited aggregation. Teraboard project consists in developing a full intra data center photonic platform for intraboard, intrarack and intra data center optical communications.

The BDVB Oil Stick, enables for the first-time online measurements of transformer oil dielectric breakdown strength. Using multi-frequency ultrasound spectroscopy, the Oil Stick determines simultaneously break down voltage (BDV), temperature (T) and oil humidity (Wc). 
Transformers are crucial infrastructure assets of Europe’s and the world’s power grids, which must be controlled and governed carefully. Today’s power supply with huge but fluctuant shares of renewable energy (solar, wind) seriously stresses transformers– leading to an increased degeneration of the transformer insulating oil and thus to a significant influence of performance and decrease of their life time. If the oil’s insulating capacity is down, transformers can’t resist higher voltages as well as the power load and often break down in fire after short circuit. A transformer loss results most often in tremendous damages: loss of production capacity, loss of power supply, loss of grid stability and supply security. The replacement time of power transformers lasts up to 80 weeks and is cost intensive. To date, no reliable online monitoring of the crucial oil parameters is available, and the transformers are operated merely in a manner of blind flying.
Passerro developed the BDVB Oil Stick to TRL 6-7. Functionality has been successfully demonstrated, during long-time operation in transformers in Italy, Romania and Germany.

The current graphene production methods, such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition and chemical oxidation and exfoliation, suffer from extremely low yield of product, limited scalability or a strong chemical oxidation by which a significant number of defects are irreversibly introduced to the graphene. Thereby, it is highly desirable to develop scalable and green preparation protocols for which the oxidation is reduced to a minimum but the production speed of graphene is still high. During the ERC 2DMATER project, we found that the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite is the ideal approach to serve this demand under optimized conditions. Here in this project, we will further develop a lab-scale equipment and process that will be able to produce high quality graphene powders and dispersions on a scale of 1 kg per day, starting from commercially available graphite sources, like graphite foils, rods and papers. We target at producing bulk graphene with electronic properties outperforming those generated by state-of-the-art wet chemistry protocols - but with reduced number of process steps. Moreover, the technologies gained in this project will be transferred towards cheaper raw materials where we aim for direct production of graphene flakes from unprocessed natural resources in cooperation with our industry partner that owns several high grade graphite deposits in Sweden. Eventually, the efficient upscaling of graphite exfoliation developed in this project will bridge the gap between current lab-scale graphene production methods and industry-relevant scales in the most economical way.

HCPV, due to its use of very high efficiency PV cells, is currently the solar technology with the highest cost reduction potential (85% in the last 5 years). REPHLECT’s HCPV builds up on the excellent results obtained in the FP7 project “NGCPV”, in which concentrator cells, module and system efficiency were improved. Now BSQ Solar, one of NGCPV’s partners, will take a step forward by designing a module that will reach a concentration of 1000X from the 820X developed by NGCPV, and at the same time including innovative features.
To reduce the associated costs, REPHLECT will design components that allow local manufacturing and will migrate assembly lines to Satellite Production Centres (SPCs) located in highly irradiated areas to produce the panels close to the market. The only most IP sensitive part, the receivers, will be developed in BSQ headquarters in Madrid.
In order words, REPHLECT intends to replicate the white box paradigm which introduced the ultimate commoditization of the computer hardware industry, by challenging the present industry model based in huge centralized upscaling in Asia.

During aluminium extraction and recycling, salt slag is generated in vast volume and is a growing environmental problem. In Europe there are >270 known aluminium processing plants and only nine salt slag recycling facilities, this number is restricted due to economic viability of operation; there are very high initial capital cost and high operating costs. These costs create a high entry barrier for any new company to enter into the salt recycling business. EU countries such as Scandinavia and Eastern Europe transport many thousands of tonnes of salt slag p.a. thousands of kilometres for processing at the few locations available at enormous financial and environmental cost.

This is a threat to the aluminium production industry as costs to process salt slag are becoming extremely high.  Due to the monopolisation of re-processing options, it is a financial security issue for the aluminium recyclers as they are in the hands of the nine salt slag recyclers in operation. This highlights an industry need for aluminium recycling companies to manage in house all of their by-products and waste materials economically.

A hybrid of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), H2AD is based on a patented bioreactor and electrode architecture.  H2AD enables a 10x reduction in the time required to reduce the organic content of waste, and recover the energy via conversion to a hydrogen/methane rich biogas. 
Effluent disposal has been identified by LIE as a key restriction on the productivity and profitability of the EU agri-food and drink processing industry (a-FDPI), which is the largest EU manufacturing industry but includes 271,000 micro and small enterprises (µSE). No viable micro-scale technology currently exists for disposal of effluents from µSE, or is able to recover energy from these waste volumes. However, currently at TRL6/7 through extensive testing on cattle slurry, H2AD can also directly address the challenge of waste management in the a-FDPI, recovering some of the 288TWh of potential energy lost in effluent from the EU a-FDPI annually.
The overall aim of the Phase 2 project is to undertake the experimental development and field trials required to confirm predicted H2AD performance/payback for new feedstocks, derived from the a-FDPI.

The core device is a thin-film III-V solar cell embedding quantum dots and photonic nanogratings to boost the efficiency beyond the thermodynamic limit of conventional single-junction devices. Combining the thin-film approach with the nanostructuring of semiconductor layers allows for a drastic improvement of power-to-weight ratio and mechanical flexibility with respect to currently available space solar cells.  The incorporation of quantum dots provides improved radiation and temperature hardness. The TFQD device targets efficiency higher than 30% (AM0), at least an eightfold increase of power-to-weight ratio vs. triple junction III-V solar cells and very low bending radius, allowing for the development of rollable or inflatable solar arrays.

During the project, Loritus will build a full-scale HTC installation to demonstrate its economic and technological performance across a range of commonly occurring waste streams sharing characteristics that make them costly to treat with established technologies. The demonstration will target at least three market applications (sewage sludge, food waste and animal by-products, and spent mushroom compost) on a commercial scale (10.000 tonnes/year).

Loritus will then operate the full-scale HTC system on a specific organic waste stream, spent mushroom compost, at a mushroom farm in Ireland to finalise the business case for HTC in a real life, industrial scale application. Such a success will induce a multiplication effect across the associated multi-national farming cooperative, and provide evidence that clients in other market segments can gain the same HTC cost and environmental advantages.

• Ultra-high reliability – to ensure close to 100% available supply for the public transport networks which will rely on hydrogen
• Short refuelling window – buses need to be refuelled in a short overnight window, leading to rapid H2 throughput
• Footprint – needs to be reduced to fit within busy urban bus depots
• Volume of hydrogen storage – which can exceed 10 tonnes per depot and leads to new regulatory and safety constraints

Light energy conversion into chemical energy by photosynthetic organisms is indeed the main conversion energy step, which originated high energy containing fossil deposits, now being depleted. By the way, plant or algae biomass may still be used to produce biofuels, as bio-ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-hydrogen. Microalgae exploitation for biofuels production have the considerable advantages of being sustainable and not in competition with food production, since not-arable lands, waste water and industrial gasses can be used for algae cultivation. Considering that only 45% of the sunlight covers the range of wavelengths that can be absorbed and used for photosynthesis, the maximum photosynthetic efficiency achievable in microalgae is 10%. On these bases, a photobioreactor carrying 600 l/m-2 would produce 294 Tons/ha/year of biomass of which 30% to 80%, depending on strain and growth conditions, being oil. However this potential has not been exploited yet, since biomass and biofuels yield on industrial scale obtained up to now were relatively low and with high costs of production. The main limitation encountered for sustained biomass production in microalgae by sunlight conversion is low light use efficiency, reduced from the theoretical value of 10% to 1-3%. This low light use efficiency is mainly due to a combined effect of reduced light penetration to deeper layers in highly pigmented cultures, where light available is almost completely absorbed by the outer layers, and an extremely high (up to 80%) thermal dissipation of the light absorbed.

The CREATE concept is to develop stabilized storage materials with high storage density, improved stability and low price, and package them in optimized heat exchangers, using optimized storage modules. Full scale demonstration will be done in a real building, with regulatory/normative, economic and market boundaries taken into account. To ensure successful exploitation, the full knowledge, value, and supply chain are mobilized in the present consortium. It will be the game changer in the transformation of our existing building stock towards near-zero energy buildings.

Nowadays, RES (solar, wind, etc.) and DERs (energy storage, EV, etc.) are connected to the grid via DC/AC converters (inverters). Now, these inverters do not provide ancillary services (power-frequency control, voltage control, etc.) like the synchronous generators (generators normally used in conventional power plants) do, which is required to avoid grid voltage and frequency fluctuations and faults. Since the amount of RES and DERs installations are drastically increasing in the world, there is an urgent need to implement smart inverters with these functionalities included. The Synchronverter facilitates the connection of RES and DERs to the grid causing a conventional inverter to mimic a synchronous generator, consequently, these power sources can actively participate in the grid stabilization in harmony with other generators. The Synchronverter has been developed by Synvertec an Israeli company seed-funded by Horizon Green Tech Ventures an investment alliance formed by Alstom S.A, Rotem Industries Ltd (Isralei company specialized in the commercialisation of advanced technologies) and Gefen Investmens ( a business incubator company). Synvertec is also participated by Israel Electric Corporation (IEC - Israeli Grid Operator) and the Office of the CHief Scientist (Israeli goverrmental R&D fostering office). Only the inverter’s market for renewable energy accounts for more than $11 billion in 2014. Synvertec aims to make a gradual approach by initially addressing inverters for PV and DES accounting for more than $7 billion in 2014 (out of which $3 billion in Europe).

It will utilise packages of interconnected energy systems that achieve a balance between energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. This is enabled by enhancing renewable technologies capacity factors by using advanced building management systems with machine learning algorithms that allow building system integration and auto-optimisation across building dimensions. 

Currently, deep energy renovations mainly focus on building-level solutions, where, cost-effectively, an energy demand reduction of 40-50% can be achieved. In district scale projects, technologies for energy generation, storage and management can be integrated cost-effectively, reducing up to an additional 25-35% of Net Energy Demand. Multi-owner complexities and need for tailored system integration make this approach location-specific and hard to replicate. A focus on multi-building, single owner situations seeks the appropriate balance for both high energy demand reduction and high market replication potential. Energy Load Management technologies (ICT based building systems management) and services that are successfully piloted in commercial buildings will be adapted to enable this approach.

Modern wind turbines are adjustable. The angels of rotors and blades can be changed. This is done by a control system optimizing production on a wind park level, or an even greater level. The wind park operator have several objectives to optimize for with the help of wind data. One is to reduce maintenance costs. Sudden wind bursts damage wind turbines, through identifying such wind bursts from a distance the wind park control system can adjust the angles of the blades to deflect the power of the wind. A second is to be able to predict energy output more accurately. This is important as wind park operators often have energy delivery contracts and are penalized if they deliver more or less than predictions. Predictions become more accurate when wind park operators have data on and understanding of the wind resources. A third objective is to harmonize all wind turbines in the park to get the highest possible stable output. This is also based on data on and understanding of the wind resources.

The benefit is that weak sections of pipes can be located and replaced before leakage and failures. Pipes can be replaced just-in-time, at their end-of-life. Due to lack of condition monitoring pipes are replaced long time before end-of-life – waste of capital.

We will incorporate photosensitizers to develop robust porous MOFs in which light-absorption initiates electron-transfer events that lead to the activation of a catalytic centre.

Microbial communities in extreme environments are characterized by low biodiversity and as a consequence serve as good models to study linkages between genomic potential and environmental parameters. Metagenome studies have shown that most of the microorganisms in extreme environments are only distantly related to cultivated bacteria. Therefore, state-of the-art enrichment techniques using chemostat and sequencing batch cultivation with inocula from geothermal sites and driven by physiological information from metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data have a high potential to result in novel isolates.

The permanent magnets in motors/generators of (H)EVs are either NdFeB or SmCo magnets, which contain large quantities of rare earths, which are critical metals with the highest supply risk for Europe. As highlighted by the European Rare Earths Competency Network, recycling of rare-earth magnets from (H)EVs should receive top priority. Reclaiming of rare-earth magnet motors/generators used in (H)EVs is a major challenge because the magnets are difficult to remove from the assemblies. The conventional hydrometallurgical routes for the recovery of rare earths from End-of-Life permanent magnets have a high environmental impact due to inefficient use of chemicals, whereas the conventional pyrometallurgical routes for the production of magnet master alloys are energy-inefficient. DEMETER, the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles, concurrently develops (1) innovative, environmentally-friendly direct and indirect recycling strategies for the permanent magnets in the motors and generators of (H)EVs that are currently already on the market and (2) design-for-reuse solutions for motors and generators in the (H)EVs of the future. An intersectoral and interdisciplinary consortium of leading EU universities, research institutes and manufacturers from the automotive and magnet sector trains 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs). The research challenges include the development of hydrogen-based grain-refinement technologies to produce nanograin magnets directly from scrap magnets, the recovery of rare earths from SmCo and NdFeB magnets of motors/generators by ionometallurgical methods, and the design of motors/generators with reusable magnets, where the designs are based on 2D and 3D flux paths as well as non-traditional materials.",3802512.24,3802512.24,H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015,MSCA-ITN-ETN,KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN,BE,INSTITUT POLYTECHNIQUE DE GRENOBLE;INSTITUT JOZEF STEFAN;THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM;MAGNETI LJUBLJANA PODJETJE ZA PROIZVODNJO MAGNETNIH MATERIALOV DD;AALBORG UNIVERSITET;VALEO EQUIPEMENTS ELECTRIQUES MOTEUR SAS,FR;SI;UK;DK,

CASCADE-X proposes an ultimate approach to directly convert CO2 to light olefins through cascade reactions over a bi-functional catalyst, obtained by molecular scale integration of an active metal alloy for the CO2-to-methanol reaction onto a zeotype catalyst for selective methanol-to-olefins conversion. Such a single-reactor cascade approach enables a simplified process scheme while overcoming the thermodynamic restrictions of the methanol synthesis by its sequential conversion. The action will generate fundamental knowledge on properties-performances relationships for the combined system, providing a rational for the optimization of catalyst and process conditions, as well as an improved understanding of key fundamental issues in both hydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins chemistry (restructuring, deactivation mechanisms, confinement effects). These goals will be pursued by an ‘all-X-ray’ approach, synergizing in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and diffraction/scattering at the laboratory and large-scale facility level in combination with complementary physico-chemical methods, to identify activity/selectivity/stability descriptors for the bifunctional catalyst. Multi-modal synchrotron nano-mapping of individual catalyst particles will elucidate the space-resolved dynamics of restructuring and deactivation phenomena.

The maintenance of optimal temperatures and optimal light incidence is critical for high crop yields. In summer, GHs are typically white washed or shaded by nets or by screens, in order to avoid excess temperature in the GH. Standing out, this sunlight surplus can be turned into electricity by adding PV panels, which can supply electricity to the national grid and/or supply the required energy for a heating/cooling system for the optimal control of the GH micro-climate. 
However, previous attempts of dual harvesting, which have been performed mainly in Italy and Spain, used conventional PV panels or semi transparent PV panels that were positioned to receive maximum sunlight on the south facing roof of GHs and significantly shaded crops all year around, resulting in a significant a negative effect, not only with regards to high crop yields loss, up to 25% but also to negative effects on edibles and fruit size, hardness and colour, which reduce sell prices of affected crops.
On the other hand, If PV panels would have been placed in other positioning then, PV harvesting would underperform and consequently PV yields would be reduced. SUN4GREEN new smart design directs light either into the greenhouse or to the PV panels depending on the season need.
What makes SUN4GREEN different and revolutionary is that its performance is season dependant and is adapted to GH characteristics. Its design allows growers having real dual sun and crop harvesting targeted to obtain benefits from both sources, which is not possible with simple, direct PV technology implementation, not adaptable to seasonal agriculture requirements and where thus, agriculture was compromised to make room for PV electricity production.

At the same time, CO2 emissions are captured and converted to hydrocarbons that are again used as fuel or as resource for fine chemical synthesis. At the heart of this vision is heterogeneous catalysis. Hence, for it to become reality, tailored highly efficient catalyst materials are of paramount importance. The goal of this research program is therefore to establish a new experimental paradigm, which allows the detailed scrutiny of individual catalyst nanoparticles and their reaction products under application conditions.
The catalytic performance of nanoparticles is directly controlled by their size, shape and chemical composition. Current studies are, however, conducted on ensembles of nanoparticles. Therefore, such studies are plagued by averaging effects, which deny access to the key details related to how size, shape and composition control catalyst performance. To eliminate this problem, we will nanofabricate a unique nanofluidic reactor device that will enable us to scrutinize catalytic processes and products at the individual catalyst nanoparticle level. In a second step, we will integrate plasmonic optical probes with the nanoreactor to be able to simultaneously monitor the dynamics of the catalyst particle state during reaction.
Finally, we will apply the nanoreactor to investigate the role of the catalyst oxidation state in Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. In parallel, we will explore novel plasmon-induced hot electron-mediated reaction pathways for catalytic CO2 reduction, as part of a carbon-neutral energy cycle.

LEILAC will develop, build and operate a 240 tonne per day pilot plant demonstrating Direct Separation calcining technology which will capture over 95% of the process CO2 emissions (which is 60 % of total CO2 emissions) from both industries without significant energy or capital penalty.

Direct Separation technology uses indirect heating in which the process CO2 and furnace combustion gases do not mix, resulting in the simple capture of high quality CO2. This innovation requires minimal changes to the conventional processes for cement, replacing the calciner in the Preheater-Calciner Tower. For lime there is no product contamination from the combustion gas. The technology can be used with alternative fuels and other capture technologies to achieve negative CO2 emissions. The project will also enable research into novel building materials with a reduced CO2 footprint, as well the upgrade of low value limestone fines and dust to high value lime applications.

The high potential of the project is complemented by high deliverability. The requested grant will secure €8.8m of in-kind funding and support from the LEILAC consortium members, which include world leading engineering, cement, lime and R&D organisations. 

To accelerate further development, LEILAC will deliver a techno-economic roadmap, and comprehensive knowledge sharing activities including a visitor centre at the pilot site near Brussels.

Transitioning to renewable energy requires policy reform, infrastructure investment, citizen mobilization, and smart financing mechanisms. The RE-DEV project will examine the conditions for the take-up of renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries and, by doing so, uncover its consequences in terms of global CO2 emissions. Drawing on a comparative study of four selected country-cases (China, India, South Africa, and Morocco), this project will offer an in-depth analysis of: (a) regulatory frameworks and existing financing mechanisms, (b) the limits and potential of multilateral climate cooperation, (c) the state of vertical/horizontal transfer of know-how. The country sample responds to a most-dissimilar-systems research design. To gather evidence, this project will employ the following methods: semi-structured interviews with policy makers, questionnaires and a participatory assessment with public/private stakeholders. As a result of this, the RE-DEV project will build knowledge on how to facilitate a sustained transition to renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries. I put a strong emphasis on three aspects: the interdisciplinary character of the project, its intersectoral nature, and the crucial issue of its timing – it needs to be carried out now, when domestic energy transitions and the post-Kyoto climate change deal (due at Paris COP 21) are at a crucial point of their development.",158121.6,158121.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2014,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN BARCELONA,ES,,,

Slag contains impurities and forms a protective crust of non-metallic & metallic oxides, and contains significant ‘free’ & alloyed metal (from 10 to 70% by weight). While slag can be used as aggregate, there are increasing concerns over ‘leaching’ of heavy metals into water courses from using these materials in civil engineering. While some metal can be recovered by re-melting slag (at very high temp), this is extremely expensive with very high energy burden which often makes recovery un-economic, but necessary. Landfill of slag is increasingly not an option. Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called ‘implosion’ to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles. This will be combined with ultrasonic vibration sieving for accelerated recovery of metal from the finest fraction. This novel technology was originally developed to recycle waste glass by reducing it to fine ‘sand’, with uniform size and no ‘sharps’ compared to normal crushing techniques. This technology has not been applied commercially to other materials. Benefits to partners, endusers & society could be: 
• Rapid recovery of more metal from slag at relatively low cost
• Strategic control of metal recovered rather than losing control thro’ export to ‘low cost’ economies 
• Enable smelters to recycle slag in-house, increasing their ‘Value Add’ while reducing ‘recycle-miles’
• 97% energy saving thro’ low cost mechanical separation rather than very high temp. melt recycling
• Huge cut in carbon emissions from thermal energy saved and ‘recycle-miles’ saved

controversial in many communities – they are noisy, visually distracting and they vibrate. An obvious disadvantage of wind
(eolic) technology is that power generation diminishes when there is no wind. State-of-the-art eolic technologies do not work
well in urban environments, which experience vertical and turbulent wind conditions. Solar PV systems’ main disadvantage
is that energy generation peaks during the day while consumption peaks at night, increasing the need for expensive
electricity storage (batteries).
The core innovation of Omniflow is our patented omnidirectional wind turbine. By integrating Omniflow with both new and
existing photovoltaic (PV) solar energy systems we can offset non-linear solar PV electricity generation and weak eolic
microgeneration throughout the day and throughout the year in different meteorological conditions (currently up to 8.8 kW,
with PV). Thanks to its design, Omniflow works well in urban environments. There is no visible motion, and it is fully
operational both on and off the electrical grid. The applications and target markets range from distributed energy to novel,
autonomous telecommunication base stations and intelligent lighting, in urban, rural and crisis-management environments in
the EU/worldwide, and has a TRL 6-7, depending on the application.
If we confirm that Omniflow represents a significant business opportunity through the feasibility study in SMEI phase 1, we
will proceed to apply for funding in phase 2: objectives include improving our turbine designs to optimize wind to electricity
conversion; adapting our technology to a range of meteorological conditions in different regions; and navigating the

The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) can reach this goal. The cylindrical reactor core contains actinide-fluorides mixed in lithium-fluoride. The liquid salt is at ambient pressure and can freely expand upon heating, giving a strong negative reactivity feedback. The core is in its most reactive state and any geometrical change lead to lower reactivity. In case of hypothetical accidents, the fuel salt will automatically be drained via freeze plugs into fail-safe tanks. The fuel salt is continuously cleaned and controlled in an integrated chemical plant. The MSFR can operate as a breeder reactor in the thorium fuel cycle or as a burner reactor fuelled with plutonium and minor actinides. In short: the MSFR excels in safety, sustainability and optimal waste management.
Within SAMOFAR we will perform advanced experiments to proof the key safety features:
• The freeze plug and draining of the fuel salt
• Measurement of safety-related data of the fuel salt
• New coatings to structural materials like Ni-based alloys
• The dynamics of natural circulation of (internally heated) fuel salts
• The reductive processes to extract lanthanides and actinides from the fuel salt

Furthermore, we will build a software simulator to demonstrate the operational transients, and we will show the mild responses of the MSFR to transients and accident scenarios, using new leading-edge multi-physics simulation tools including uncertainty quantification. All experimental and numerical results will be incorporated into the new reactor design, which will be subjected to a new integral safety assessment method.

In the award winning Tamturbo direct drive design the turbo wheels of a two stage compressor are directly coupled to a high speed electric motor.  The main benefits of the turbo design over state-of-the-art dry screw compressors are 15 % lower electricity consumption over the 10-15 year life cycle, decreased operating, maintenance, waste management and overhaul costs due to minimum wear, and the benefit over other turbo designs is better capacity control under variable loads. 
Fast business growth is attempted by offering the compressors and related service packages under Tamturbo brand in Scandinavia and under Private Label or OEM contracts in other markets.  Medium size compressor manufacturers which do not have access to oil free technology today are seen as the most promising commercialization partners.

We will derive new and fundamental insight in the relation between nano-scale structure and the performance of 3rd generation solar cells, and determine how to apply this in large-scale processing.
THE CHALLENGES
We currently have a superficial understanding of the correlations between structure and performance of photovoltaic heterojunctions, based on studies of small-scale devices and model systems with characterization techniques that indirectly probe their internal structure. The real structures of optimized devices have never been “seen”, and in devices manufactured by large-scale processing, almost nothing is known about the formation of structures and interfaces.
THE SCIENCE
We will take a ground-breaking new approach by combining imaging techniques where state of the art is moving in time spans on the order of months, with ultrafast scattering experiments and modelling. The techniques include high resolution X-ray phase contrast and X-ray dark-field tomography, in situ small and wide angle X-ray scattering, resonant scattering and imaging and time resolved studies of charge transport and transfer. To relate our findings to device performance, we will establish full 3D models of charge generation and transport in nano-structured solar cells.
THE FOCUS
Solution cast solar cells is the only technology that promises fast and cheap industrial scaling, and it is consequently the focus of our efforts. They require a tight control of processing conditions to ensure that the proper nano-structure is formed in the photoactive layers, with optimal contacts to charge transport layers and interfaces. The prime contenders are non-toxic polymer and kesterite solar cells.

Ferentis’ Biomimetic Tissue Matrix (BIOTIMA) project addresses the need for efficient toxicity testing/cell culture tools enabling more physiologically relevant, predictive and functional tissue mimicking models, that should become the EU standard in its effort to reduce expensive and inhumane animal testing. 
Ferentis scientists have developed an innovative patent-pending biosynthetic material –a bioplastic- that is cell-free, stable, biocompatible and optically clear and has demonstrated clinically to promote regeneration of cells. By employing advanced surface nanoengineering techniques, this biosynthetic hydrogel can be deposited, functionally modified and patterned on different substrates, for a variety of lab tissue experiment applications.  The unique advantages of our tissue matrix include unique biomimetic properties, most closely mimicking those of the real tissue, and advanced nano-fabrication methods, allowing a cost efficient, versatile and easy to use solution.

SRPs are usually harvested fully automatically with harvesting machines that directly chop the wood into chips which are then combusted in CHP plants. However, the chipping leads to losses of up to 30 % of the energy content due to microbial degradation of the wood during drying.
SalixEnergi Europa AB has developed an innovative new harvesting technology which enables a fast drying of the wood without any losses of the energy content. The rods are cut into pieces with a length between 12 and 24 cm (depending on the purpose), so-called billets. When stored in piles the good air circulation enables a fast drying while the bark protects the billets from microbial degradation. A first technical prototype has demonstrated the proper functioning and huge potentials of the technology. However, improvements and adaptations are required to achieve the market breakthrough. In this proposed project a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility of the envisaged improvements and the optimal way of implementation, while a business plan will show the optimal way of commercialisation.
The billet harvester will allow European energy farmers to use the full energetic potential of the wood and thus increase their income by up to 30 %, while the increased production of CO2 neutral energy per unit of area will help Europe to reach its goals of climate control. The improved profitability of SRPs will moreover lead to a further fast growth of the plantation area.

Lithium Ion batteries (LIBs) are currently dominating the energy storage market, as they are to date best performing devices in terms of energy storage capability (energy density). However, LIBs are still facing challenges because they lack of a high power density, meaning these devices have long charging/discharging cycles. This issue is especially important in view of efficiently exploiting renewable energies and especially for supplying the required energy to power electric vehicles (when high energy inputs are required in a very short time). As alternative, supercapacitors emerge as alternative to Lithium Ion batteries because these devices can provide high energy inputs in just a matter of seconds because of their high power density. Nevertheless, in contrast with LIBs, supercapacitors cannot accumulate enough energy to supply during a long time (they have a low energy density). For these reasons, supercapacitors and LIBs are being used as complements one of each other in those highly energy demanding applications. In view of the rapid market entrance of electric vehicles and the big pressure towards using alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, the energy sector is facing an increased need for solutions to enhance the power density of LIBs and to improve the energy density of supercapacitors.

The new blades will allow to produce wind energy in areas where to date it is not cost effective because of low wind, but also to increase the efficiency (20%) of existing wind farms through the re-blading programme. To date, it estimated around 10.000 turbines in Europe that could benefit from re-blading.

They also contain earth-abundant and nontoxic materials, so they are much environmentally friendly than today's batteries are. However, to take advantage of all opportunities that market offers, it is necessary that some technical capabilities of the SCs improve. While the currently available energy density is acceptable for applications such as emergency doors, memory backup and so on, limited energy density is widely perceived as the main impediment to growth of its sustainable energy applications. Therefore, much research and development has focussed on increasing SCs energy density at assumable price.

thermal power with 20% electrical and 90% overall efficiency based on wood pellets . We achieve these test bench proven
parameters by developing a steam engine technology with a new approach. The technology readiness level is TRL7. This
CHP technology has a potential energy costs saving rate of up to 84% for customers compared to natural gas heating and grid power. This high efficiency is achieved by applying steam inlet conditions in excess of 500°C and 100bar. This technology is developed with the focus on costs, reliability, efficiency and mass production. The basic patent process will be finished in 2014. By applying this technology throughout the EU, the carbon dioxide production could be lowered significantly as the fuel for this technology is wood or any other solid biomass or organic waste, which is burned highly efficient within the process. As this technology has base load capability, this would be a perfect supplement for the existing renewable energy systems like photovoltaics and wind.
Also, the dependency on fossil energy like oil and gas could be lowered. As the used fuel grows everywhere in the EU, the
price of energy produced by this technology will be lower. Moreover the price will be much more time stable as there are
thousands of wood suppliers who make this market much more competitive than the existing fossil fuel market with the

The overall objective of the MeRIT project is the commercialization of a new Hybrid Energy Storage System that ‘maximizes renewable energy integration’ through provision of fast-responding ancillary services, dramatically reduces the 60% - 70% capacity losses of wind and solar generation due to intermittency and no storage; it also reduces curtailment losses through synthetic inertia. 

MeRIT users will benefit from new ancillary services revenues, additional capacity revenues, reduction in curtailment losses and compliance with new grid code modifications. 

The Esave management team is highly entrepreneurial and has extensive experience and skills in design and manufacture of power electronics, development of computer systems, software, provision of electrical power quality services and consultancy. 

The objective of the Feasibility Study is to (1) Develop cost and payback financial models for the integration of MeRIT with wind and solar installations internationally. (2) Complete the planning process for the installation of a Demonstration System which will be installed on a windfarm in Ireland, controlled, monitored and validated by EirGrid, Ireland’s Transmission System Operator.

MeRIT is at the stage of TRL5 and an operational prototype system is ready for installation. Esave is partnering with Mainstream Renewable Power, a major wind and solar developer/operator, who will facilitate the installation on a windfarm that they operate. The Energy Research Centre, University College Dublin - Energy Institute, is also partnering and assist in renewable integration expertise and system modelling.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,ESAVE CORPORATION LIMITED,IE,,,

Based on the current market trends the total market volume and waste generation will increase more than 5-times by 2022, causing a huge environmental impact.

Despite the growing popularity and implementation of artificial grass fields, there are no unified regulations or procedures for its EOL management. Current recycling technologies enable only low-efficiency infill separation from the artificial grass that is also time consuming, expensive and unsustainable. Therefore, most field owners landfill the used turf without any recycling, creating a big environmental impact and increasing the need for raw materials in new installations.

ASIE, company with over 20-years of experience in installing artificial grass fields, has developed the first mobile and complete artificial grass recycling line that helps to lower the synthetic turf EOL management costs by up to 40-50% and increase the artificial grass sustainable management recycling rates. Compared to alternative solutions, we ensure:
• 2x better infill separation (100%)
• 4x faster old turf removal (1 day)
• 2x faster field renewal (7 days)
• 30-40% cheaper field renewal

Our goal is to achieve a zero-waste concept and improve the ecologic and economic sustainability of artificial grass installations. Our unique mobile technology enables to reuse about 95% of the used materials in new artificial grass application or as a raw material in other industries together with:
• 100% infill materials and polyethylene reclaim
• 4x better turf removal enabling re-installation
• 6x reduced transportation needs, leading to 95% less CO2 emissions

Our total addressable market in Europe is €350 million annually, with very high growth potential in the next years. As a result of the innovation project, ASIE will generate €25m annual revenue and create more than 50 new jobs by 2022.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2015,SME-1,ADVANCED SPORTS INSTALLATIONS EUROPE AS,EE,,,

European seas contain many tons of waste, mainly plastic (around 400 kg per km2). This plastic litter has a very negative impact in the marine environment even affecting the food chain (potentially triggering endocrine and/or carcinogenic processes).

To contribute to mitigate this problem ECOALF proposes to implement a collaborative scheme with fishermen’s organisations (agreements already signed) to collect plastic from seas; to implement an industrial process that includes waste management, pellets production and additivation, spinning and fabrics, and clothes manufacturing; and to distributions and marketing the new products in Europe.

To that end ECOALF proposes a feasibility study:
-To analyse the economic feasibility of the initiative (production cost, volume of sales, incomes; relevant economic indicators; sensitive analysis).
-To identify logistical needs to obtain the marine plastic litter and to establish a mechanism to provide the consumer with a reliable Guarantee of Origin (GoO) that reflects that the clothes are made 100% from plastic waste and which percentage is from marine origin.
-To ensure the technical feasibility to additivate properly the flakes to obtain pellets that fulfill with ECOALF fabrics requirements. To define the adequate terrestrial / marine mix to ensure stability during the sinning process.
-To carry out a survey among clients and distributors to assess the market reaction to these products and to select at least four countries to carry out a market test.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,ECOALF SL,ES,,,

Achieving this would represent an important step forward in the processing of 2D semiconducting materials and will provide the key parameters for fabricating the next generation of ultrathin electronic appliances.
The inherent high-risk of 2D-INK is countered by a strongly interdisciplinary research team composed of 9 partners (8 academics \ 1 SME) with demonstrated experience in their corresponding fields and with different yet highly complementary backgrounds. Therefore only together and in synergy they will be able to address the challenges of the multiple research and innovation aspects of 2D-INK that cover the entire value chain from materials design and synthesis, characterisation, formulation and processing to device implementation. 
In addition 2D-INK has the potential to revolutionise research on 2D semiconducting materials way beyond the current interests on synthesis (high impact), since the efficient dispersion and formulation of 2D semiconducting materials into inks enables the applications of 2D semiconducting materials over different scientific and technological disciplines, such as electronics, sensing, photonics, energy storage and conversion, spintronics, etc.

Currently it’s not, since the existing solutions do not provide energy at a competitive price level. PolarSol has developed the first solar heating system capable of operating around the year even in cold-climate conditions. Moreover, it provides energy that is cheaper than district heating! The innovation is based on the patented heat exchanger made from thin stainless steel sheet. This unique element serves as a core for all processes within a full-cycle hybrid system, including heating, cooling, waste heat recuperation, and energy storage. Using same element for multiple purposes allows customers significantly reduce investments, shorten payback time and increase ROI. For most of objects the payback time is 3-5 years, which is by far the industry record.
The system has already been piloted in Finland, Estonia, Czech Republiс, Poland, Malta, Ukraine and Russia for a variety of objects including private houses, industrial plants, spas and multi-story buildings. The system is easily scalable and can be supplied both to B2C and B2B markets. However, so far PolarSol has paid little attention on focusing marketing and sales effort in order to attract as diverse customer base as possible. The diversity has provided us better opportunity to test different system modifications. One of the main goals of the project is to identify customer segments with the highest market potential with special emphasis on B2B market. This goal will be pursued in Phase 1 by means of market surveys and thorough analysis of available options.
The whole delivery chain is so far mainly handled by PolarSol itself. The goal of Phase 2 is to develop the international network of partners and local representatives and build up effective sales and distribution channels.

This is because of two constraints: i. The energy PV generates at each conversion event is set by its bandgap, irrespective of the photon’s energy. Thus, energetic photons lose most of their energy to heat. ii. PV cannot harness photons at lower energy than its bandgap. Therefore, splitting energetic photons, and fusing two photons each below the Si bandgap to generate one higher-energy photon that match the PV, push the potential efficiency above the Shockley Queisser limit. Nonlinear optics (NLO) offers efficient frequency conversion, yet it is inefficient at the intensity and the coherence level of solar and thermal radiation. 
Here I propose new thermodynamic concepts for frequency conversion of partially incoherent light aiming to overcome the SQ limit for single junction PVs. Specifically, I propose entropy driven up-conversion of low energy photons such as in thermal radiation to emission that matches Si PV cell. This concept is based on coupling 'hot phonons' to Near-IR emitters, while the bulk remains at low temperature. As preliminary results we experimentally demonstrate entropy-driven ten-fold up-conversion of 10.6m excitation to 1m at internal efficiency of 27% and total efficiency of 10%. This is more efficient by orders of magnitude from any prior art, and opens the way for efficient up-conversion of thermal radiation. 
We continue by applying similar thermodynamic ideas for harvesting the otherwise lost thermalization in single junction PVs and present the concept of 'optical refrigeration for ultra-efficient PV' with theoretical efficiencies as high as 69%. We support the theory by experimental validation, showing enhancement in photon energy of 107% and orders of magnitude enhancement in the number of accessible photons for high-bandgap PV.

Since 2007 we have been working to develop a novel green heat recovery system for professional laundry systems (ReHeat) by applying the heat pump water condensed dryer principle.
Professional laundry equipment is energy intensive: 66 billion kWh/year or 78% of all laundry electricity consumption. Many inefficient products continue to be placed on the market, despite lower life cycle cost for products with higher efficiencies. If no specific measures are taken, the annual energy consumption of laundry equipment is predicted to increase 17% by 2030.

For commercialization purposes it was essential to integrate these new materials with existing high-throughput manufacturing methods such as injection moulding. Unfortunately, these processes result in un-organized CNT arrangements whose figures of merit typically drop by an order of magnitude compared to what is measured in individual nanoparticles. 

Some of the most promising future applications of CNTs and graphene, such as high density energy storage and water filtration however require engineering of order, morphology, and porosity at several length scales to create highly ordered 3D structures. In this project, we propose a new process which assembles CNTs and/or graphene into microstructures using microfluidic emulsification followed by large area self-assembly into colloidal crystals.

Using molten zinc has a number of advantages over traditional processes:

Economic process as:
Speed of tyre destruction is just 30 minutes rather than 2-4 hours as in traditional rotary kiln processes.  
No shredding / granulating; whole tyres, savings in capital and operational costs.  
No scale-up issues: doubling the surface area of the molten material doubles the throughput.  
Separation: the molten zinc is used to separate the steel and carbon black.  

Every year over 1.5 billion tyres are discarded worldwide.  Tyres are a composite plastic material and difficult to recycle, but they do contain value in their constituent raw materials such as oil, carbon black, copper and steel.  

Because the process utilises existing, proven technologies from low cost industries such as the hot dip galvanising and the carbon black manufacturing industry the technological and hence commercial risk is minimised.  

The tyre recycling process was proven to work as intended in collaboration with University College Cork.  The next step is to construct a demonstration plant and to proof the recycling of the tyres on this scale providing customers with the confidence of investing into full scale plants.  

For all the above waste streams the European and US legislators are increasing the pressure on industry to develop a solution, presenting an opportunity.  At the same time a US government report suggests that the US requires up to 200 tyre recycling plants with the European market of similar size as the car ownership is similar.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,COMPOSITE RECYCLING LIMITED,IE,,,

However, one of the main limitations of using solar power as an energy source is that the electricity must be used immediately or stored in a secondary device .   Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells combined in tandem with PV cells offer a solution to this problem by using solar radiation (light) to electrolyze water  and generate hydrogen which can then be converted to electricity using fuel cells or be used to synthesize and store hydrocarbon fuels by hydrogenation of CO2 .  The host’s (Prof. Avner Rothschild) research group at the Technion Institute of Technology in Israel has recently made a landmark advancement in the quest for efficient solar water splitting. The development of a resonant light trapping technique  in ultrathin absorbing films on reflective substrates opens the possibility to overcome the greatest challenge facing efficient water splitting in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, namely, the trade-off between optical absorption length and charge carrier collection length.  The Experienced Researcher proposes a novel research plan building upon the invention and involving heteroepitaxial deposition of ultrathin Fe2O3 films for solar water splitting.  The proposed research is highly innovative and will develop methods for precise control of thin microstructures and their compositions; these will allow for engineering of films that are nearly free of defects which will improve the efficiency of the photoanodes by suppressing bulk recombination and at the same time, cover novel fundamental research directions such as study of doping on α-Fe2O3 properties without entanglement from microstructural effects, heteroepitaxial multilayer structures with selective charge transport layers, and directional charge transport in α-Fe2O3.",170509.2,170509.2,H2020-MSCA-IF-2014,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,TECHNION - ISRAEL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,IL,,,

The CHARISMA architecture meets the goals of low-latency (<1ms) and security required for future converged wireless/wireline advanced 5G networking. This provides a cloud infrastructure platform with increased spectral and energy efficiency and enhanced performance targeting the identified needs for 1000-fold increased mobile data volume, 10-100 times higher data rates, 10-100 times more connected devices and 5x reduced latency.

Energy storage units for energy autonomous sensor systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) must possess high power and energy density to allow quick charge/recharge and long-time energy supply. Current energy storage devices cannot meet those demands: Batteries have large capacity but long charging/discharging times due to slow chemical reactions and ion diffusion. Ceramic dielectric capacitors – being based on ionic and electronic polarisation mechanisms – can deliver and take up power quickly, but store much less energy due to low dielectric breakdown strength (DBS), high losses, and leakage currents. 

RTF are ideal candidates: (i) Thin film processing allows obtaining low porosity and defects, thus enhancing the DBS; (ii) slim polarisation hysteresis loops, intrinsic to relaxors, allow reducing the losses. High energy density can be achieved in RTF by maximising the polarisation and minimising the leakage currents. Both aspects are controlled by the amount, type and local distribution of chemical substituents in the RTF lattice, whereas the latter depends also on the chemistry of the electrode metal. 
 
In CITRES, we will identify the influence of substituents on electric polarisation from atomic to macroscopic scale by combining multiscale atomistic modelling with advanced structural, chemical and electrical characterizations on several length scales both in the RTF bulk and at interfaces with various electrodes. This will allow for the first time the design of energy storage properties of RTF by chemical substitution and electrode selection.

The ground-breaking nature of CITRES resides in the design and realisation of RTF-based dielectric MLCCs with better energy storage performances than supercapacitors and batteries, thus enabling energy autonomy for IoT sensor systems.",1996519.0,1996519.0,ERC-2018-COG,ERC-COG,MATERIALS CENTER LEOBEN FORSCHUNG GMBH,AT,,,

They are very promising as an alternative for the existing ones, but still need to advance to reach higher efficiency and durability and require synthesis methods compatible with the industrial production of CMOS devices at wafer scale.

This project stems from the observation that no existing TES option can be coupled to such PCUs and/or work at these temperatures, and aims at filling this gap. Three interrelated research objectives are proposed, to prove the feasibility and assess the potential of
1. an innovative CSP concept whereby (i) the receiver is co-located with the TES vessel, (ii)
the solar radiation is directly absorbed by the liquid storage medium, and (iii) the thermal
power is withdrawn from the TES by bubbling a gas through it, which can thus be used as

It is also a key challenge for the
20-20-20 strategy of the EU.

Sustainable housing starts with 'near zero-energy' buildings, i.e. homes that are so well insulated that it becomes easy to
produce more renewable energy on site than what is consumed.

Today, house construction in Europe is mainly performed by craftsmen who are small local builders and who work with
traditional technics and who are not keen to invest on research and development of Modern Methods of Construction
(MMC). As a consequence, it remains very difficult for consumers and investors to buy 'plus energy' houses in Europe (costs
and lack of offer due to lack of know-how).

The objective of the project is to provide to local builders the products and the tools so that they can offer to their customers
'nearly zero-energy' buildings with guaranteed performance and cost controls.

To do so, ECOXIA has developed the concept of 'Smart Envelope'. Built in the ideal conditions of the factory, the envelope
is installed in a 'Plug & Play' way on site in one day. It includes both energy performance and the components to make it
smart.

ECOXIA developed a prototype in 2012 to check the performance of its building envelope. Installed in Yerres, France, it
proved the interest of the concept from a mechanical, thermal, comfort and cost standpoints. The recorded consumption
proves that the prototype is a 'plus energy' building with the production of only 20 sqm of photovoltaic solar panels.

To be able to commercialise the right solution and help Europe to develop a new industry, ECOXIA needs to go further into
its feasibility study by addressing the following questions:
- which is the best level of prefabrication?
- how can we improve the price of our solution for the European market ?
- who are the best potential partners for our project in Europe?
- what are the regulatory issues on the most relevant markets in Europe?'",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,ECOXIA SAS,FR,,,

Industry development
The composite industry is a fast growing and widely expanding industry. The majority of all commercial composite product are based on thermosets. Thermosets can not be separated in the original fiber and matrix materials. Hence reuse or recycling is hardly possible. Within a few years the lack of recyclability imposes an undesired situation. 
Problem
Mass production is required to server high volume commodity products and markets. Mass production require advanced automated production processes which requires thermoplastic tapes as semi-finished product. Current thermoplastic tapes are of limited quality, hampering the shift towards increased recyclability.
Intended Innovation
Years of involvement in the industry and the development of thermoplastic unidirectional tapes production processes resulted in an improved production method. The production method is based on an industry knowledge cross-over. The realization of a full scale mass production facility will be realized with an incumbent textile manufacturer, by means of a joint venture. 
Benefit
Once commercial available, the innovation contributes to a increased recyclability of new composite products. The use of high quality thermoplastic tapes will reduce weight in several products of high volume markets. The realized weight reduction of the products will result in a decrease of CO2 emission during the transportation and during the lifetime of products. 
Effect

Despites many efforts, there are remaining issues that need to be solved and this will provide final direction of LSB technological development. Some of technological aspects, like development of host matrices, interactions of host matrix with polysulphides and interactions between sulphur and electrolyte have been successfully developed within Eurolis project. Open porosity of the cathode, interactions between host matrices and polysulphides and proper solvatation of polysulphides turned to be important for complete utilisation of sulphur, however with this approach didn’t result long term cycling. Additionally we showed that effective separation between electrodes enables stable cycling with excellent coulombic efficiency. The remaining issues are mainly connected with a stability of lithium anode during cycling, with engineering of complete cell and with questions about LSB cells implementation into commercial products (ageing, safety, recycling, battery packs). Instability of lithium metal in most of conventional electrolytes and formation of dendrites due to uneven distribution of lithium upon the deposition cause several difficulties. Safety problems connected with dendrites and low coulombic efficiency with a constant increase of inner resistance due to electrolyte degradation represent main technological challenges. From this point of view, stabilisation of lithium metal will have an impact on safety issues. Stabilised interface layer is important from view of engineering of cathode composite and separator porosity since this is important parameter for electrolyte accommodation and volume expansion adjustment.

The next decade and beyond may average 1,000 offshore towers/year worldwide, with an overall investment volume around 15-20.000 M€/year. 

This growing sector faces technological challenges, as it is set to move into deeper waters further offshore while being able to reduce the costs in order to reach a competitive LCOE (levelised cost of energy). For water depths above 40m (70% of the future market) approximately 40-50% of investment corresponds to the substructure (foundation and tower). Therefore a significant cost reduction in foundation/tower would drastically improve the overall cost of offshore wind energy. 

This project intends to develop and demonstrate in operative environment a full scale prototype of a revolutionary substructure system for offshore wind turbines. The concept consists in a self-installing precast concrete telescopic tower which for the first time ever shall allow for crane-free offshore installation of foundations, towers and turbines, thus overcoming the constraints imposed by the dependence on offshore heavy-lift vessels. It will allow for a full in-shore preassembly of the complete system, which is key to generate a highly industrialized manufacturing process with high production rates and optimized risk control. The main benefits expected are:
• 30-40% cost reduction (both CAPEX and OPEX).
• Large water depth applicability range for deep offshore (>45m water depth). 
• Supports increased turbine size (5-8MW).
• Allows for large scale fast industrial deployment of foundations.
• Reduces dependence on costly and scarce installation vessels.
• Improved asset integrity (durability)

This project will involve organisations that are active in the safety, management and disposal of radioactive waste and research entities.
The first step of this project will be to engage in discussion with Member States representatives in order to clarify the organisation of their national R&D consistent with the implementation of the Council Directive. The second step will be to identify existing research programmes that could contribute to the identification of common scientific objectives and activities as well as specific aspects that the organisations would like to develop in the Joint Programme.

Lab and pilot tests have been and are being conducted and show promising results. A next step in the development is creating a sound business model for further commercialization, and the construction of a first plant at full-scale for further optimization and demonstration purposes to potential clients.

As renewable energy sources are gaining more ground in the electricity mix in Europe, imbalance problems on the electricity grid will increase in frequency. The proposed concept offers a solution to this imbalance problem by converting excess electricity via hydrolysis to H2 and using (waste) CO2 to CH4 that can be injected into the gas grid. The advantage of the proposed system is the small scale (< 10 MWe), so the conversion can be done near the production sites.

When there is an excess of renewable electricity, fees are paid to the operators of renewable electricity for not producing, thus avoiding grid imbalance. Although this approach is understandable from a balancing perspective, it is contradictory to a sustainable approach and in conflict with the existing renewable energy targets. Therefore, producers of renewable electricity are a first important target group for our technology.

CO2-intensive industries are a second important target group. By recycling their waste CO2, they become more sustainable, and it can generate extra revenues from buffering activities.

During the feasibility study, OWS wants to elaborate a sound business plan for further development of the technology. It should result in a clear vision on technical, economic and legal issues.

The share of household income spent on energy bills is growing and is impacting not only low-income households. Many of existing solutions for lowering energy bills for households are expensive and are targeted at home owners. They include new passive buildings, better insulation of existing buildings and/or generation of locally renewable energy (e.g. geo-thermic, solar, wind). 
Even though many already proven solutions exist that aim to increase energy efficiency and energy production in buildings via walls and roofs, windows are usually considered as a subject of energy loss and not taken into account for sustainable energy production. Could we optimize certain features of windows, such as blinds, and how should we do it? We believe that in the future, window blinds could add additional warmth in the winter and help to keep rooms cool in the summer; become a source of light; produce electricity; and when needed, block or let light in.

- Product development and production of a low-cost energy recovery system.  
- A Hybrid energy storage systems with ultracapacitors and batteries that enable autonomous operation of the microgrid system.  
- Connector elements to add versatility to the system (so that other sources of micro generated energy such as solar panels or micro wind generators could simply be installed in buildings).

up until the revolutionary change to LCD and plasma screens that has recently taken place. Consequently, the current CRT
population (1.9 billion screens; 500 million of them in Europe) is becoming obsolete and will require processing (not landfill)
according to WEEE regulations, since the high proportion of lead in the glass means that landfills have an unacceptable risk
of lead leaching into groundwater. The very low manufacturing rates for new CRT worldwide now mean that recycling the
glass back into CRTs is no longer an option, and the only alternatives to avoid landfill have been to use the glass as a
smelting flux (85% of it remains as a toxic slag), or using foundry temperatures (1000°C) melt extraction for the lead, which
is extremely energy and CO2 costly, and at best produces an 80% co-stream of low value glass.

The focus of the project is on building construction and process industries (from architects to raw material suppliers). 
The BAMB-project implements the principles of the waste hierarchy: the prevention of waste, its reuse and recycling. Key is to improve the value of materials used in buildings for recovery. This is achieved by developing and integrating two complementary value adding frameworks, (1) materials passports and (2) reversible building design. These frameworks will be able to change conventional (cradle-to-grave) building design, so that buildings can be transformed to new functions (extending their life span) or disassembled to building components or material feedstock that can be upcycled in new constructions (using materials passports). This way, continuous loops of materials are created while large amounts of waste will be prevented. 
Activities from research to market introduction are planned. Fundamental knowledge gaps should be bridged in order to introduce both frameworks on the market. Advanced ICT tools and management models will enable market uptake and the organization of circular value chains in building and process industries.

Graasten Brickworks aims to address this potential and gain access to a major market opportunity through the development of an innovative building material – CleanTechBlock - which will enable a paradigm shift within the construction process and recycling in Europe. 

CleanTechBlock is a patented multifunctional sandwich-block solution based on the combination of two clay brick shells and foamed recycled glass. The advantages of CleanTechBlock over bricks are compelling as the insulation, strength properties and construction price are similar to alternative solutions and it offers an overall increase in the inner space (3-5%) and a potential reduction in the overall house wall construction time (5x faster), while reducing maintenance requirements. In addition to the economic benefits, it can contribute to the mitigation of environmental problems – increase of waste recycling and decrease of raw material consumption, energy consumption and CO2 emissions (more than 50%). 

Our vision is to take the final steps of technological development and maturation towards industrial scale production of CleanTechBlock leveraging on the opportunity provided by the SME instrument. Besides giving the participating companies a technological leap with the consequent competitive advantage and export potential, the project will strengthen GB´s position in the clean-building materials field and assist Europe in achieving objectives for environmental and energy policy, both in terms of waste recycling and general reduction of CO2 emissions.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2015,SME-1,GRAASTEN TEGLVAERK A/S,DK,,,

With Climote, you can control your home heating from anywhere using our full suite of remote services. 

We want to create an advanced demand and management tool for domestic heating and cooling. This tool, based upon Climote’s home heating hub, will help delivers Europe’s goal of a low carbon economy by allowing advanced demand management of heating and cooling to help prevent curtailment of European wind farms. Using the hub we can collect information about the household’s energy usage and create a profile for that household. This profile shows what energy is used for and when. We can then schedule certain regular and predictable tasks to happen automatically. By removing the need for manual control, not only do we make people’s lives more convenient, but we also remove human error from the equation, resulting in less energy wastage, Furthermore these tasks can be scheduled to take place at certain times, such as during off peak hours when the cost of energy is lower and there is excess renewable energy on the grid. This has both the advantage of reducing energy waste, and of shifting consumption to renewable sources. 
Domestic homes account for about 27% of Europe’s total energy consumption. Of this the majority is made up of space and water heating and cooling which is responsible for over 80% of domestic household emissions. By networking the households together into a single central scheduling structure, we can significantly reduce the CO2 emissions across Europe.

The process is socially responsible, environmentally sustainable and economically viable. No chemical solvents are used, devulcanization takes 1 min, and there is a 99% crumb conservation. DEVULC TPV is a versatile material that can be engineered to provide a range of properties. It has a consistent quality and can be incorporated in up to 25% content for the production of new rubber products.

Unlike current separation methods, the process is capable of working in an uncontrolled density solution of water for all polymers and is significantly less than 50% of the Capital and Operational cost of existing technology, while exceeding the quality requirements of the industry.

This technology has the potential to revolutionize plastic recycling across Europe and funding will help us bring it to market
quicker.

Developed to meet the needs of the recyclers, the process involves a low capital and operational expenditure, which opens the equipment to small and medium sized recyclers across Europe, allowing them to separate plastics which are currently classed as too expensive to separate. This adds value to the recycler, and provides manufacturers a rich source of useable recycled material at a local level. Our technology has the potential to make a major change in the way plastics are recycled across Europe. Every unit will reduce plastic to landfill by 2000/tonnes a year, helping Europe meet the EU goals for plastic recycling by 2020. 

Just 50 units operating across Europe will reduce the plastic going to landfill by one percent and create thousands of jobs throughout Europe in recycling, supply chain and manufacturing. 

Phase 1 will see Impact Laboratories undertake a feasibility assessment for introducing the technology across the European market. We will look at the supply chains, the needs of recyclers from different European countries and the needs of manufacturers throughout Europe to ensure the technology addresses their needs.

Its major value-added lies in the unique combination of a total independence on fossil fuel, the solution requiring only solar energy, and very competitive water costs ranging between 0.80€ and 2€/m3 for applications above 100m3/day. 

The major innovation of Watergate lies in the fact that the whole system “desalination-energy source” has been redesigned, resulting in an integrated system that solves the critical issue of the low efficiency of renewable energy desalination. The value-added of Watergate relies on two pillars: 
- The reduction of the size of the required solar field by more than 20% through a minimization of the energy consumption and a maximization of the energy efficiency; 
- The absorption of the variations in energy intensity, making it possible to work without any complementary energy source. 

The market potential for Watergate is substantial. It will not only target the current low to middle scale market accounting for 500,000 m3/day of yearly installed capacity, it will also boost the development of desalination in energy importing countries: Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Greece and Israel; as well as extend the scope of the market to users with no access to fossil fuel.

Floating Power Plant A/S and linked third pary Floating Power Plant Ltd (FPP), aims to pursue a major opportunity by bringing its innovative hybrid concept – an offshore-proven, floating, wind and wave power plant – to commercial maturity. Specifically, with POSEIDON, FPP aims to go a step further in its business strategy by overcoming the key barriers that may hinder the successful market uptake of its commercial-scale device – the P80.The innovation project activities will be focused in the UK (primary target market).
P80 is based on a unique patented technology, which presents several advantages when compared with current offshore renewable concepts: facilitates deployment in deeper waters; enables higher energy yields; allows a reduction in capital costs due to shared foundations, grid infrastructure, and platform (between wind and wave); and allows a reduction in O&M costs due to its unique safe harbour. Overall this translates into a reduction of LCOE (up to € 0.13/kWh), which is the ultimate objective of the EU offshore renewables industry in order to become competitive.

Many projects stopped and investors have become sceptical of wave power. Currently the cost per watt of usable wave energy is high, due to a focus on energy conversion methods and efficiency, rather than on mooring and grid connection, accounting for more than 90% expenditure.
Wavepiston is a break through near-shore wave power technology producing energy from waves at a competitive price with respect to the most efficient renewable energy technologies. The system consists of identical modules mounted on a string pumping pressurized water to shore for successive energy conversion. Using Wavepiston’s patented “force cancellation” principle the system is able to reduce the amount of forces on the mooring and structure to 1:10, requiring a simpler structure and therefore reducing capital costs. The Wavepiston system can provide cost efficient, clean and reliable renewable energy to help meet Europe’s increasing demand and achieve emissions reduction targets. The offshore application ensures it is a suitable fit also for remote islands and isolated coastal communities.
The Wavepiston system was conceived in 2006 and in 2009 the concept of force cancellation was patented. In 2010 numerous tank tests were performed with a system 1:30 the size, that experimentally validated the system and proved each panel can harvest more than 5% of the energy contained in a wave. In 2013 a proof of concept was carried out offshore with a system 1:9 the size and it worked better than predicted.

Reliable and Bankable Wind Resource Assessment in offshore wind parks, presents a huge challenge as IEC compliant measuring devices are at the moment only provided by fixed met-masts. In addition, the areal expansion of the zones of potential development of offshore wind parks combined with the need for more measuring points within the candidate area, impose a need for redeployable, lower cost and reliable wind measuring devices. Furthermore, as offshore wind parks are getting into deeper waters, further from the shore and bigger in size, the costs are scaling up too and need better wind resource assessment to mitigate this and drive down the costs per kWh. Finally, financial competition between potential offshore wind parks raises up the question of reliability of the data measurements in order to lower the income risks for lenders. The solution to the above issues can be provided by the FloatMast innovative combination of three industries: Onshore Wind, Naval and Oil and Gas. On the deck of a small TLP which is a standard and proven technology in the Oil & Gas Industry, a met mast and a Lidar are fixed. This provides the ability to transfer the Onshore Wind Measurement methodology of short met mast and Lidar to produce IEC 61100 wind measurements. In addition, integration of environmental sensors (green and blue) on the platform will provide the environmental monitoring data that are useful for both the pre-construction consenting phase and the operational phase of the wind parks, thus fulfilling the environmental permit.

Solar adsorption systems are quiet, simple to operate, and can last for a long time. However, they have low cooling power density, and subsequently have to be bulky compared to similar solar thermal systems offering the same performance. This can increase their initial costs, especially for small and medium sized systems, thus reducing their uptake. Currently researchers have successfully tackled this issue by, for instance, using more than one adsorbent bed to adopt a continuous cycle, and using forced cooling for the adsorber bed and condenser. These have not resolved the bulk/cost issues, however.

We will develop a robust simulation model to help with the design process. The system will be partly built using a novel diffusion bonding process that enables dissimilar materials to be joined seamlessly. We will test the adsorption properties of the novel adsorbent materials and apply them to the refrigerator. We aim to deliver a solar adsorption refrigerator that employs nano-technology and novel manufacturing methods, meets the performance improvements currently achievable but not with the bulk and complexity.

To achieve this, a solar cell with an efficiency in excess of 50% is required and will require considerable development over the present state of the art.  In particular, a new semiconductor absorber layer with a 1eV band-gap will be required in addition to solar concentrations in excess of 1000X.  The proposed research addresses both of these areas.

Preliminary work has identified the use of bismide semiconductors to achieve the required 1eV semiconductor junction.    A 1eV GaAsBi0.062 layer can be grown that has only 0.6% mismatch to GaAs, as compared to conventional  In0.3GaAs that introduces >2% mismatch.

We will characterise the optical and electronic structure of these new materials using spectroscopic ellipsometry and photo/electroreflectance.  The nature and concentration of defects will be determined using time-resolved optical spectroscopy and correlated with solar cell performance data by extending existing computer models.

To achieve high efficiencies at high concentrations, it is necessary to reduce the resistive loss. Here, we propose to exploit lateral emission in tensile quantum well (QW) layers to provide a parallel radiative transport pathway that delivers photogenerated charges to the electrical contacts. A series of InGaP/InGaAsP QW test structures in compressive, tensile and unstrained configurations will be grown to control the directionality of emission, which will be confirmed using spectroscopic measurements.

- High-Class Concrete (HCC), encompassing materials with enhanced performance in strength,  durability;
- Fibre-reinforced Cementitious Composites (FCC), with special features on fibre/textile reinforcement and matrix improvement.

Developing synergetic through-life multi-scale models for these novel materials is the key objective of the SUPERCONCRETE project. Particularly, three transversal modelling issues (MIs) are considered:
- Rheology and Early age, dealing with the various physical and coupled thermo-hygro-chemical phenomena taking place in the first hours after mixing;
- Hardened state and service life, approached by constitutive modelling intended at predicting the instantaneous and long-term behaviour, for both service and ultimate conditions;
- Extreme conditions, based on constitutive theories capable of simulating the response under fire and high temperature exposure.

Each CC and MI is covered by one participant and the interactions among them is based on a matrix-like organisational approach aiming at achieving a true synergistic collaboration among those with specific CC knowledge and the ones bringing in transversal competences on MIs.

b) to make profound assessments of the substantial funding needs and available resources. 
c) to solicit strong actions by the partners involved (member states of the EU and other countries) with a three-step approach (Berlin model).

This will include 
- knowledge gathering, involving structured intelligence processes, 
- outline strategies, 
- assessment of lead times, 
- scenario building, 
- consideration of funding synchronization issues. 
- assessing the economic potential(s), timing, and organisation towards the deployment of CCS within Europe, and gradually increase the deployment so that it applies to Europe as a whole, thus providing a Pan-European infrastructure for CO2 transport, 
- the initiation of a strict planning of the infrastructure, including the handling of specific policy issues and regulatory requirements.

The primary objective of the SafeTrain Project is to pilot and test in real environment the autonomous system for the automatic train detection that will be integrated with our UOZ-2 animal deterring device. The new train location system will be based on an intelligent mechanism of listening for an approaching train commercially known as an “Indian ear”. 
Our goal is to incorporate it into the animal deterring system in order to make it independent from the currently used rail signalling system. This will not only reduce the complexity of the whole system but also will reduce the investment and maintenance costs down to 60% of the todays costs. 
The secondary, but not less important goal is the development of green powering system for UOZ-2 utilising renewable energy sources to make the system energetically self-sustained. This will be of particular importance in areas where the rail track has not been electrified and thus with limited access to grid power. 
Our acoustic method for train-animal collisions prevention is an excellent solution that allows preservation of ecological corridors and animal migration routes and significantly reduces the safety and business risk of rail carriers.  It overcomes all limitations of the state-of the-art solutions available on the market, and looking at Europe only, opens the way to the market worth of nearly 125m€.",1967500.0,1377250.0,H2020-SMEINST-2-2014,SME-2,Przedsiebiorstwo Wdrozeniowo-Produkcyjne NEEL Sp.

Drage&Mate International has a patented in-situ on-demand hydrogen generation process able to increase the total gravimetric energy density of the system. This improvement allows existing vehicles to multiply by 2 or even by 7 their existing range which means a very profitable new opportunity to market.

The current study will analyse how to progress to a commercial profitable product. To do that, GULWESS-PROP will validate the feasibility (technical, economic and operational) of the development and define a preliminary Business Plan.
The goal is to transform the prototype solution which is currently in a TRL6 development stage to TRL9 market commercial product by the end of phase 2.

Once GULWESS-PROP will be validated, a business chance will start-up to supply such technology to unmanned vehicles. In the close future similar system could be used in manned vehicles, and all kind of space vehicles. With this approach GULWESS-PROP will, at the end, lead a major impact within the decarbonised transportation goals in Europe. 

Although the lightweight hydrogen storage segment counts with several competitors, GULWESS-PROP has a competitive advantage over the rest of solutions related to the user experience: the final users consider that is easier to operate thanks to reactor cartridge refillable concept.

To do this, the use of fossil fuels in all sectors and particularly in power sector will be continuously reduced and replaced with renewable energy sources. Such transition depends on proper electrical energy storage (EES) technology for renewable energy management in order to handle the varying solar and wind generated electricity. So far only redox flow batteries (RFB) show potential for renewable energy management because of: i) scalability between storage capacity and power; ii) short response time; iii) good cycling capability, iv) long discharge time and v) low cost potential. The use of state-of-the-art metal based RFBs is limited by their relatively high costs that inherently are linked to the low current and energy density. Recently a breakthrough in RFB technology is reported, high current densities are achieved  in a RFB based on organic-halide electrolytes. Organic-halide RFB can store electricity at almost ten times lower life cycle cost compared to metal based RFB, due to increased current density and lower electrolyte costs. One of the objectives of the current proposal is to investigate feasibility and stability of organic-halide RFB. The main goal of the fellowship is to build All Organic RFB by replacing the halide part (Br2) with less hazardous and cheap organic electrolytes which have extremely fast electrokinetics: (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxy (TEMPO) and hydroxylated anthraquinone di-sulphonic acids.  Since latter are not commercially available, a new chemical synthesis routes will be developed. Nanoporous films and anion exchange membranes will be considered as an alternative to expensive proton conductive membrane-Nafion.

Within the scope of this fellowship, hosted by Dublin City University (Ireland) in collaboration with Arrows Biomedical GMBH (Germany), a highly sensitive platform to detect Human Papillomavirus (HPV), causative agent of about 99.7% of cervical cancer, will be developed. The proposed diagnostic platform will be based on a laser textured biopolymer as device substrate, functionalized with nanoparticles produced via the Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL) technique. This on-chip immunoassay will allow rapid detection of the HPV. The novelty of this project lies in the high-quality bio-nanostructures as nano-labels via PLAL designed for ultrasensitive detection of HPV. 
Two major aspects of this project are: (1) the development of complex nano-labels specifically targeting high risk HPV; and (2) improvement in the performance of the developed assay  increasing their sensitivity and specificity, relative to current start of the art. 
Ultrapure HPV-specific nano-labels will be prepared using pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a green synthesis route independent of any chemical processing. The proposed technique is advantageous due to the enhanced surface activity of laser-generated nanoparticles, which will reduce the amount of sample molecules needed for the successful detection by improving the limit of detection and overall detection time.

A large, unmet, and growing patient population will require treatment for Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and revenue in this market will continue to grow driven by the aging population and the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most widely used non-surgical treatment, however when used in areas of long calcified stenosis, PTA does not show satisfactory results at long term follow up. Stenting has become the most obvious choice to overcome the limitations of PTA. Unfortunately, long term performance of stents appears to be problematic as they do not prevent (and may to a certain extent even cause) a failure mode known as restenosis. Whilst covered stents have tackled the problem of restenosis within the stent the stent itself interrupts the bloods natural spiral laminar flow (SLF) and increases laterally directed forces and wall shear stress downstream of the implantation causing downstream disease progression. Re-institution of the bloods SLF reduces the forces and turbulence caused by stenting, and reduces neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) distal to the stent which can lead to occlusion distal to the stent.

The global objective of the project is to develop an innovative endovascular stent that will reintroduce the natural spiral laminar flow both through the stent and distal to the stent that can be manufactured to be deployed using standard delivery system profiles. With the long term post project target of increasing patency rates to greater than 80% and reduce restenosis of the stent by greater than 20% and distal stenosis by greater than 20% at 2 year follow up.

Inorganic glass-based electrolytes are very promising materials due to their higher ionic conductivity when compared to crystalline alternatives. Nevertheless, important concerns still have to be resolved and optimized. For instance, ionic conductivity in glass-based electrolytes continues to be poor compared to liquid electrolytes and their stability still lacks of long lifetime capability. In general, necessary innovative scenarios are needed as the next step forward in current thin film battery research. In order to improve performance and solve these issues in LIB's we propose, as the main purpose within HS-GLASS\ion, the addition of a new class of materials, the so called highly stable glasses (HSG). These glasses can achieve remarkable properties when prepared through vacuum deposition processes when tuning several parameters during film growth. This new discovery is well considered as an important development in glasses and supercooled liquids but still unknown in the area of energy storage. HSG’s have higher densities which can help to easily create large homogeneous areas without any performance threatening artefacts. They are more resistant to temperature and vapor uptake which will increase chemical and structural stability of electrolytes. The lack of grain boundaries but the coinciding existence of short-range order will modify Li\ ion mobility achieving properties that have not yet been explored in battery research.

A key question in this context is whether schemes to maintain or increase carbon stocks through forest management actually co-benefit biodiversity. Although frequently promoted, assumptions about such co-benefits have not been rigorously assessed. Forest and CO will test whether policies designed to protect either biodiversity or carbon in Europe’s temperate forests are synergistic or conflicting. Three work packages (WP) will focus on both unmanaged, old-growth forests, representing a baseline for key ecosystem functions, and managed forest, constituting the majority of Europe’s forests. WP1 will build a network of forest researchers to gather existing data on old-growth forests in Europe, and create the first map of their distribution. WP2 will use plot-level data to model the relationship between forest biodiversity and carbon storage, and assess whether this relationship differs between old-growth and managed forests. WP3 will test whether carbon/biodiversity co-benefits vary, when scaled up to broader extents, using satellite products and vegetation-plot databases. This action will provide new insight into the synergies and trade-offs between carbon and biodiversity in temperate forests and develop methods to map these trade-offs.

By 2030 the world will have to produce 50% more food and energy and 30% more water. Consequently, most countries are implementing programs to reduce carbon emissions and enhance renewable energy production. 
MAD is the most widespread technology for the treatment of sewage sludge, the by-product of sewage treatment. This natural process uses bacteria to break down biodegradable material and produces a biogas rich in methane. The current drive to maximise energy recovery means that biogas from MAD is increasingly harnessed by combined heat and power technology. Thus, there exists the need to optimise digester performance to maximize energy recovery.
The benefits of improved performance go beyond CO2 reductions, as they will facilitate environmental improvements, reduce operating costs and improve the financial performance of the European and global wastewater industry. The challenge is to improve digester control to minimize excessive mixing, so eliminating additional, unnecessary environmental and financial costs whilst maximising biogas output.
We will simulate for the first time the complex relationships between hydrodynamic and microbiological processes in a MAD environment, whilst also recognising the potential for grit sedimentation within digesters. We will extend significantly previous work and use coupled CFD/MAD modelling as an innovative and robust technique to monitor and control the hydraulic and biochemical performance of MAD.

Sluggish kinetics of the ORR remains a key barrier to efficient electricity generation in FC operating on renewable fuels such as hydrogen or alcohols. Poor understanding of the ORR mechanism has hindered development of cost-effective and improved FC catalysts. 
This project aims to bring about a step change in development and understanding of ORR catalysts by (i) synthesising metal nanoparticles with a strained surface structure, and (ii) developing and implementing new in situ and operando infrared (IR) spectroscopic techniques to understand how strain impacts the ORR mechanism. Novel strained core-shell Pt-based catalysts will be developed, featuring a core of inexpensive metals including Ni, Co or Cu. For the first time, insight into the ORR mechanism for supported electrocatalysts under realistic catalytic turnover will be gained by modifying an approach to combining IR spectroscopy and electrochemistry developed in the Vincent group.

Novel technologies play an enabling role in the realization of such solutions. Better devices for the detection of annihilation quanta resulting from positron annihilation are an example. In material science these detectors are needed for research on renewable energies and innovative energy storage using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). In medicine they are required for diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring of diseases using Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET).
In both fields time resolution is a key parameter. Sub-100 picosecond resolution is needed but not yet available. Improvement of time resolution, however, must not deteriorate other performance parameters. This project aims to overcome present physical limits. Monolithic scintillation crystals will be read out with digital photon counter (DPC) arrays coupled to each of its surfaces. Innovative data processing methods will be developed to eliminate the influence of scintillation photon propagation, currently the major bottleneck in large scintillation crystals that are nevertheless needed for high detection efficiency.

The detector will be incorporated in a PALS setup. After the performance has been characterized, it will be used for TU Delft’s materials research on renewable energy. The detector characterization will also serve as a proof-of-concept for application in clinical TOF-PET devices.

In order to do so, two different epitaxial techniques will be used to accomplish the epitaxial growth of the nanowires: standard MOVPE growth and the ground-breaking technology of Aerotaxy. Then, the nanowires will be embedded in a polymer and transferred to a Si substrate.

This project adds to this dynamic research with a focus on forests. Forested landscapes represent the ecological inheritance of centuries of forest management to supply, among other products, the fuel necessary for human activities. Thus, to meet their demands for firewood past societies gradually modified and transformed the landscapes they inhabited. We focus here on the evolution of historical forests in the Euganean Hills (Colli Euganei, Padua-Italy) through wood charcoal production. Charcoal production is extremely polymorphic and fully understanding it requires the use of different approaches and disciplines (including history, ethnography, archaeology, geography, archaeobotany etc.) The aim of this project is to develop an integrated approach combining all disciplines to reconstruct forest landscapes on the Euganean Hills at different temporal and spatial scales. 
The choice of the Euganean Hills has been guided by its interesting biodiversity, by the numerous diachronic archaeological surveys previously undertaken, by the wealth of written and cartographic documentation concerning the uncultivated lands and also by the willingness of local actors to promote their region thanks to the richness of the landscape and its history. The project THISTLE aims to reconstitue the history of cultural landscapes, and more precisely of forest landscape of the Euganean Hills (Colli Euganei, Padua-Italie) with a pluridisciplinary approch in order to protect and promote them at different geographical scales (from local to global).",180277.2,180277.2,H2020-MSCA-IF-2014,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA,IT,,,

In the SNIFFPHONE project, we aim to tackle these requirements by integrating heterogeneous micro- and nano-technologies into autonomous smart system that can be attached to a mobile phone and analyze disease markers from exhaled breath. In this approach, an interaction between breath sample and a miniaturized array of highly sensitive nanomaterial-based chemical sensors is recorded, stored and pre-processed by integrated miniature on-chip microfluidics and electronics, and then the relevant electrical signals are transferred wirelessly via the mobile phone’s internet to an external server. Statistical pattern recognition methods are then applied on the received data and a clinical report including the screening results is sent back to the designated receiver (e.g., specialist, family doctor) in case of positive result is revealed.

These so-called “cable bacteria” were first isolated from marine sediments, and laboratory experiments demonstrate that electrons are passed on from cell to cell along the longitudinal axis of the filaments. This long-distance electron transport radically extends the physiological capacities of prokaryotes, and profoundly changes our understanding of biogeochemical transformations in marine sediments. 
In my PhD research, I have documented that in addition to oxygen, these sulphur oxidizing bacteria can also use nitrate as an electron acceptor. This new form of “electrogenic” nitrate reduction could have important implications for the removal of bio-available N in marine ecosystems. However, the effect of this newly described nitrate reducing process on the global nitrogen cycle, as well as the factors that ultimately control the occurrence, remain unknown.
The goal of this project is to identify the end products of the electrogenic nitrate reduction and the environmental controls that regulate its occurrence. This project will hence provide new insights into the physiological abilities of micro-organisms and improve our understanding of N dynamics in marine sediments, strengthening European excellence in these fields of research.
The goals of the project will be attained by combining state-of-the-art biogeochemical techniques with a novel and interdisciplinary approach based on principles traditionally applied in microbiology, electrochemistry and geophysics.

En3, a young technology company, founded in 2009 in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, has developed an expansion device for small scale Waste Heat Recovery systems (WHR-systems). Small scale means a net AC power rating of the WHR-system from about 1 to 50 kW. 
EN3’s WHR-system is based on the Clausius Rankine Cycle (CRC) or alternatively on the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology and can substantially improve the efficiency of industrial processes, engines and facilities. They lower the primary energy consumption, improve the efficiency of engines and processes, reduce emissions and protect the environment and resources.
The great advantage of the technology is the flexibility in terms of the heat source. In principle WHR-systems can be adapted to different kinds of heat sources. Above-average market potential for the environmentally friendly and CO2 neutral electricity and heat production is identified for waste heat delivered from exhaust gas of combustion engines. Further applications are seen in the power generation through biomass combustion as well as in the geothermal and solar thermal energy generation.
The objective of the overall innovation project (phase one to three) is to develop and commercialise EN3’s small scale WHR-technology.

The general applicability will be guaranteed by the following measures:
- Applying self-learning control techniques instead of model-based control approaches, will make the controller easy to implement in different configuration and generations of DHC networks.
- Three control strategies are included in the controller (peak shaving, market interaction, cell balancing). Dependent of the network, one or more of these strategies can be activated.
- The controller will be an add-on to many existing DHC network controllers and SCADA systems.

To present this general applicability, the controller will be demonstrated in two existing grids: one highly innovative low-temperature DHC network In the Netherlands and a more common medium-temperature district heating grid in Sweden.

Since additional value is created by applying the control strategies in the controller, innovative business models should be developed to distribute this value amongst the different market players (producers, transporters, consumers of energy). This will also be addressed in the project.

Also a plan will be developed on how the developed controller can be replicated to other countries than the ones of the demonstrators, taking into account different market organizations and legal framework.

We have designed, built, deployed and are currently operating a grid-connected turbine in Scotland. In this project we will conduct a feasibility study into the market potential for our direct-drive tidal turbine design.

One way to reduce the cost and increase the reliability of tidal turbines is to find innovative ways to utilise the benefits of the subsea environment by using seawater to lubricate and cool the turbine drive train. Another is to reduce the number of offshore components by eliminating the gearbox to produce a direct-drive turbine. These steps reduce or eliminate the need for expensive and failure-prone equipment such as high pressure shaft seals, watertight bulkheads and cooling systems. This reduces operational costs and increases device reliability and yield. 

No company to date has developed a direct drive tidal turbine that is reliable and economically viable. Our design is innovative in the particular combination of drive train, blade and support structure design, which is optimised to minimise the lifetime cost of the integrated system.

Potential customers are tidal energy project developers seeking to generate predictable, reliable energy from the tides at minimum lifetime cost. The market for tidal power is global, but Europe is taking a lead with potential clients in the UK, France and Ireland. Once proven in Europe the technology can be exported worldwide, with a potential global market of 800 TWh per annum (IEA-OES), or annual electricity sales of over €40 billion.

─ Diminution of operating cost reducing up to 50% volume of digestate managed (current digestate management cost reaches average annual expenditure of EUR 90,000 for each biogas plant)
─ Increased revenues by commercialisation of high quality fertilizers (450.000 €/year)
─ An estimated return period of the investment of 1,5 years
BIOFERLUDAN success will come from the fact that THERE IS NOT any so competitive solution in the market and, what else, it will suppose an estimated annual turnover of 315 million € considering its implementation in at least 10% of the current 7000 EU biogas plants",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,Ludan Renewable Energy España S.L.,ES,,,

A significant aspect of this is the uncertainty inherent in the potential environmental impacts of novel technology. To ensure consents are compliant with EU and national legislation, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats Directive, costly and time consuming surveys are required even for required even for perceived lower risk technologies in sites which may not be of highest environmental sensitivity. It is therefore the aim of the RiCORE project to establish a risk-based approach to consenting where the level of survey requirement is based on the environmental sensitivity of the site, the risk profile of the technology and the scale of the proposed project. RiCORE will study the legal framework in place in the partner Member States to ensure the framework developed will be applicable for roll out across these Member States and further afield.
 
The next stage of the RiCORE project is to consider the practices, methodologies and implementation of pre-consent surveys, post-consent and post-deployment monitoring. This will allow a feedback loop to inform the development of the risk-based framework for the environmental aspects of consent and provide best practice. The project will achieve these aims by engaging with the relevant stakeholders including the regulators, industry and EIA practitioners, through a series of expert workshops and developing their outcomes into guidance.
 
The impact of the project will be to improve, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive specifically Article 13 (1), consenting processes to ensure cost efficient delivery of the necessary surveys, clear and transparent reasoning for work undertaken, improving knowledge sharing and reducing the non-technical barriers to the development of the Offshore Renewable Energy sector so it can deliver the clean, secure energy",1393532.5,1393532.5,H2020-LCE-2014-3,CSA,THE ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY,UK,"MARINE SCOTLAND;E-CUBE STRATEGY CONSULTANTS;WAVEC/OFFSHORE RENEWABLES - CENTRO DE ENERGIA OFFSHORE ASSOCIACAO;FUNDACION AZTI - AZTI FUNDAZIOA;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK -  NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, CORK",UK;FR;PT;ES;IE,

This is not without its challenges requiring more efficient ways to store electrical energy to balance demand with supply. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most desirable form of energy storage (high energy / power densities) but an increasing demand of Li commodity chemicals combined with geographically-constrained reserves will drive up prices in the future. Due to the high abundance, low costs and very suitable redox potential, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) should open new avenues of research and engineering as complementary alternatives to LIBs. This shift has to be accompanied with a deeper understanding of the chemical reactions involving the multiple cell components.
The proposed project focuses on a next step of in situ NMR spectroscopy, offering the unique possibility of non-invasive real-time studies of batteries under operating conditions – to track the formation of intermediate phases and investigate electrolyte decomposition during cycling of LIBs and NIBs. Significantly different shifts of the multi-component samples, resonance broadening as well as interferences of the NMR and external battery cycler (EBC) circuit impair the experiments. Hence, we will set up a novel NMR probe system allowing “on-the-fly” adjustment of the NMR circuit during the measurement and sample orientation changes via an automated goniometer. Moreover, an entirely new NMR-EBC-connection design will benefit the real-time experiments.

The aim is to develop an optimized combination of innovative Thermal Energy Storage-TES (specialized for CSP scale 1-5 MWe) and engineering solutions to improve the number of production hours of an existing small CSP plant, located in a desert area and coupled with an ORC system. With an optimized TES solution, it is possible to extend periods of energy production of a CSP plant (also during non-solar radiation), eliminating or minimizing the need to burn fossil or renewable fuels in hybrid or back-up systems. Nowadays, efforts are being devoted to R&D on TES for large-scale plants, though large potential for small/medium-scale CSP installations exists. 
ORC-PLUS is in the spectrum of “large scale prototype to pre-commercial scale demonstration”. The technology proposed is based on a solar field, using a thermal oil as Heat Transfer Fluid and ORC power unit coupled with an innovative TES. Experimental demonstration of two different industrial prototypes of TES systems will be performed in relevant  environment (TRL 6). For each prototype, a simulation model of the pilot processes will be developed, with prototypes of TES systems. The models will be optimized on the basis of the characteristics of the site and power load, to determine conditions and relevant parameters of the real scenarios for each application and to select the TES technology best fitting the needs of the targeted sector. Final result will be an industrial pilot plant used to validate the technology in a real operational environment and to demonstrate its feasibility (TLR7). Validation includes an analysis of the techno-economic viability and environmental impact, and of the replicability of the pilot plant final design.

After exocytosis, vesicular components are retrieved by endocytosis for maintaining efficient synaptic transmission. The mechanism of vesicle fusion and retrieval has been subjected to intense interest but also fierce debate for the last 40 years. Several modes of synaptic vesicle cycling have been described that rely on distinct kinetics, associated proteins and spatial organisation of the exo- and endocytosis sites. Yet, the mechanisms underlying endocytosis initiation and coupling to exocytosis are still largely unknown because the detailed dissection of single vesicle recycling remains a major challenge. Using live imaging techniques and protocols to detect fusion pore opening directly, the fate of vesicle proteins at the plasma membrane will be monitored during synaptic vesicle cycling in synapses and hemi-synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons. I will test the relative contribution of each mode of exo-endocytosis during synaptic activity. Additionally, the favourable geometry of the new hemi-synapse model will allow high resolution mapping of the presynaptic exo- and endocytosis sites. Correlating the organization of exocytosis and endocytosis sites with the location of key proteins such as calcium channels and scaffold proteins will reveal the functional microarchitecture of the presynaptic nerve terminal.

The project focuses on bio-inspired molecular circuits, where several light-absorbing molecules are linked together to form antenna systems displaying ultrafast electronic energy transfer (EET). We aim to identify and understand how coherent effects can direct, control, and optimize energy flow after photo-excitation. PHOEBUS will answer to the following questions: (i) does coherence radically change excitation transport compared to incoherent hopping of excitation? (ii) how can we design chemical structures that use coherence in light harvesting? Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is the ideal experimental tool to track EET and unveil coherent couplings in multi-chromophoric complexes. This optical technique is at the frontier of ultrafast spectroscopy. We will develop a 2DES apparatus using sub-10fs optical pulses and we will use it to determine the quantum-chemical rules guiding ultrafast EET in these innovative systems.

Hence, carbonate minerals, which are stable over geological timescales, will provide a safe long term CCS solution. Additives will also be tested in the nanomaterials in an attempt to increase their CO2-storage capacity. The proposal also involves applied research in the form of exploitation of the end-product carbonates in the building industry. The successful outcome of this project will be based on the researcher’s extensive experience in the study of mafic and ultramafic ophiolitic rocks and mineral carbonation, as well as on supervisor’s expertise in the fields of nanomaterials and CCS.",151648.8,151648.8,H2020-MSCA-IF-2014,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITY OF CYPRUS,CY,,,

Therefore, they find potential commercial applications in several sectors of economic activity. Some of them are already commercially viable, such as aquaculture, agriculture, human nutrition or cosmetics, while some others still need R&D to be further developed, such as bioenergy or feed. 

In addition, bearing in mind that microalgae are the most efficient natural CO2 capturing system, are very productive and do not compete with fertile lands, they have potential to simultaneously contribute to palliate the big crisis humankind is facing: environmental sustainability, energetic efficiency, and food security. 

AlgaEnergy, a solid Spanish biotechnology based SME, did identify this potential. Since its establishment, it has served as a vehicle to consolidate the existing knowledge within the scientific field of microalgae in Spain -a recognized international hub in the matter-, which was dispersed across universities. Using it as a stepping stone, it has been investing in generating further R&D in order to scale-up the processes and develop ready to market products, so that the achievements in the laboratory phase reach also the society. 

Within this task, AlgaEnergy has recently been able to reach a semi-industrial scale (TRL 7) with the start of the first phase operations of its semi-industrial plant in South of Spain, that captures real flue gas emissions directly from the second biggest combined cycle plant in Europe, being a worldwide premier. Therefore, AlgaEnergy is now ready to orientate its technology towards the commercialization of its already commercially viable products.

As an answer ELSA will implement and demonstrate an innovative solution integrating low-cost second-life Li-ion batteries and other direct and indirect storage options, including heat storage, demand-side management, as well as use of intermittent RES.

The core idea is to consider Storage as a Service towards building and district managers for local energy management optimization, and towards DSO for enhanced network operations. ELSA will adapt, build upon, and integrate close-to-mature (TRL>=5) storage technologies and related ICT-based energy management systems for the management and control of local loads, generation and single or aggregated real or virtual storage resources, including demand response, in buildings, districts and distribution grids. 

Data models ensuring interoperability among building, districts and DSOs and novel business models enabled by energy storage “as-a-service” will be developed.

Different configurations will be demonstrated along six test sites, where a set of different storage technologies will be integrated. Safety issues and social acceptance will be dealt with by communication and product reliability demonstration.

The objective for the current proposal is to prove the capability of the HIsarna ironmaking technology to achieve at least 35% reduction in CO2 emission intensity, compared to blast furnace operated site based on Best Available Technology Currently Installed. This will be achieved through:

-Change operation parameters in order to achieve at least 35% CO2 intensity reduction per tonne of hot rolled coil compared to the conventional blast furnace – BOF route through:
   >Combined iron ore and scrap operation with a scrap rate of 350kg/thm;
   >Partially replacing coal injection with sustainable biomass injection (at least 40%);
   >Minimising coal rate by maximising energy use in the reactor, through balancing the energy between the upper and lower part of the reactor (<700 kg coal per tonne hot metal in pilot reactor);
   >Using limestone instead of burnt lime as a fluxing agent;
   >Quantifying potential for energy recovery from hot off-gas by installing boiler test panels;
   >Making the process ‘CCS ready’ by having process gas suitable for CCS with little or no processing by replacing compressed air and N2 carrier gasses with CO2 and CH4 as carrier gas;

This forms part of the long-term Blue Growth (BG) strategy to support sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors as a whole; something which is at the heart of the Integrated Maritime Policy, the EU Innovation Union, and the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable growth.
Within the Blue Economy, there are new and emerging sectors comprising technologies that are early stage and novel. These are referred to as Blue Growth sectors and they have developed independently for the most part without pursuing cooperation opportunities with other sectors. MARIBE investigates cooperation opportunities (partnerships, joint ventures etc.) for companies within the four key BG sectors in order to develop these companies and their sectors and to promote the multi-use of space in the offshore economy. The sectors are Marine Renewable Energy, Aquaculture, Marine Biotechnology and Seabed Mining. MARIBE links and cross-cuts with the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance and the Galway Statement by reviewing the three European basins (Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Baltic) as well as the Caribbean Basin. 
The project begins with an assessment of the current Blue Growth economy. A socio-economic study of the various Blue Growth sectors will be undertaken.

The ink formulations will be tested on a case study through printing of a thin film battery. The general objective of the project is to scale-up the ink formulations to pilot line ensuring large volume fabrication of new products with improved properties for printing application. Especially, the particles definition at nanometer size will be one key parameter for the compatibility in ink jet printing. Moreover, knowledge will also be generated on electrochemical inks formulation and additives used in order to stabilize the ink products. 
The concept of nanomaterials for printing application will be applied to flexible printed electronics and more specifically to printed batteries. These printed batteries are needed as power source at the closest part and the development of printed electronics so as to as to design an all-in-one product allowing better process ability in ink jet process for 3D design and 2D screen printing process.
BASMATI will also provide a new source of nanomaterials for the formulation of conductive and electrochemical inks. These nanomaterials will be metallic particle (Ni, Cu, Al) that will be usable for numerous applications of printed electronic on flexible substrate. Another type of nanomaterials will be layered positive active material such as LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) and olivine LiFePO4 (LFP). 
The know-how level reached in BASMATI by research groups and transfer and up-scale to pilots (TRL 6) at SMEs and industry facilities will pave the way for future industrialization of inks formulations production for mass markets such as printed electronics.

By keeping components and their embodied material in use for longer, significant energy use and emissions to air and water can be avoided. In addition to environmental benefits, remanufacturing provides opportunities for the creation of highly skilled jobs and economic growth.  

Despite these accolades, remanufacturing is an undervalued part of the industrial landscape and an under-recognised sustainable industry. Activity to promote remanufacturing is currently undertaken at a sectoral level for some product sectors. In Europe, unlike in the recycling industry, cross-sectoral activities to facilitate knowledge transfer and promote the industry do not exist. Our major competitors, the US and China, already have a common vision and strategy for remanufacturing within their industrial landscape. An outcome may be that European remanufacturing could lose competitiveness against these more organised sectors. As a result, there is a real need for a European-level solution to encourage remanufacturing throughout Europe.

This proposal sets out the formation, coordination and support of a European Remanufacturing Network (ERN) over a project period of two years, which aims to:
• encourage new businesses to take up remanufacturing
• help existing remanufacturers improve their operations
• improve competitiveness of remanufacturers domestically and internationally
• create greater awareness of remanufacturing in the public and policy makers to increase demand and address barriers.

The aims of the ERN will be achieved through:
• mapping out the current remanufacturing landscape in Europe and estimating its future potential
• disseminating best practice in remanufacturing business models, processes and design
• providing industry with remanufacturing knowledge, tools and partnerships

This scenario has imposed urgent needs to develop fossil fuel alternatives like solar fuels. In order to produce solar fuels, the coupled reduction of CO2 and H2O is one of the most promising processes.  However, the generation of efficient, stable and low-cost material for CO2/H2O reduction remains a big challenge. Silicon carbide nanowires (SiC NW) exhibit the unique properties of large surface-to-volume ratio, tuneable transport properties and quantum size effects, which is very promising for the reduction of CO2/H2O to produce solar fuels.  To date, the studies on SiC NW for CO2/H2O reduction are limited due to the lack of (1) large-scale production techniques, (2) in situ characterization of the growth mode, and (3) there are no economical devices available for the evaluation of SiC NW. This project, SOLARFUELS, proposes the engineering of SiC NW for solar fuels production through the development of a carbon nanotube template method for large-scale synthesis of SiC NW combing with in situ characterization of SiC NW during growth and post-mortem. Design of an economically viable device is envisaged to exploit the in house generated SiC NWs. By introducing novel multiple sample holders for atmospheric gaseous reaction, the designed device can enable efficient catalyst/reactant contact along the vertically orientation of SiC NW and reduce the cost for the device by at least a half.The SOLARFUELS is built across research areas of materials science, chemistry, chemical and device engineering.

The low wave making hull will be optimized vs. power system and payload layout, manoeuvrability and safety requirements. The vessel will be an improvement also from the comfort point of view by the lower noise obtained and the integrated heat pump air conditioning. Another innovation, from a large fleet perspective, will be the lightweight Aluminium made hull, for better material recyclability and accommodation of the heavier energy generation and storage system.

Today CSP plants with molten salt storage only partly achieve these objectives. Key enabling technologies to be demonstrated and introduced in the market are 1) design and operation of molten salt once-through steam generator – This will allow  fully flexible plant operation; 2) design and implementation of integrated weather forecasting and dispatch optimization – This will allow optimal management of the energy storage to maximize revenues while respecting constraints/commitments (e.g. to the grid). Towards 1), an innovative design approach is proposed, integrating process and equipment design with dynamic simulation of the system. Proven technologies in separate fields (molten salt ; once-through steam generator ; optimum control) will be for the first time integrated and demonstrated. Towards 2), different approaches to DNI forecasting (direct; mesoscale models) will be integrated to extend geographical coverage and improve reliability. Dispatch optimization under conditions of uncertainty (weather forecast) and perturbations (e.g. grid support requests) will be developed. Furthermore, automatic plant performance characterization by machine learning will be implemented to ensure a real optimum is achieved. For succesfull market introduction, a down-scale pilot will be realized. Here, integrated operation of once-through steam generator, weather forecast and dispatch optimization will be demonstrated.

Printed electronics allows for the direct printing of a range of functional (conductive, resistive, capacitive and semi-conducting) nanomaterials formulations to enable a simpler, more cost-effective, high performance and high volume processing in comparison to traditional printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturing techniques. It has been reported by Frost and Sullivan  that the market for printed electronics will increase in revenues from $0.53Bn in 2010 to $5.04 Bn in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate of 32.5%. 
However, the migration towards low-cost, liquid-based, high resolution deposition and patterning using high throughput techniques, such as inkjet printing, requires that suitable functional nanomaterials formulations (e.g. inks) are available for end users in industrially relevant quantities. Presently, there are issues with industrial supply of nanomaterials which are low cost, high performance, environmentally friendly and tailored for high throughput systems. Therefore better collaboration is warranted between supply chain partners to ensure nanomaterial production and nanomaterial formulations are tailored for end use applications to meet this need. 
The INSPIRED project will address these fundamental issues within the printed electronics industry: Ensuring that suitable functional nanomaterials formulations (inks) are available for end users in industrial scale quantities.

Current commercial micro-turbines operate on average only 20% of the time being unable to work at wind speeds less than 4m/s. This result has given micro-wind turbines an inefficient and undesirable reputation, and they are now scarcely recommended by suppliers as they cannot guarantee their payback time.

The patented Briareo polymeric blade has been designed by applying high quality aerodynamic principles to operate in both lift and drag modes according to the specific wind, being especially performing in winds lower than 4m/s. The SME proponents have eventually developed their own turbine which in tests has exhibited a rotational capacity 4x that of current turbines. The Briareo micro-wind turbine is based on the “Ikea” concept: it can be purchased of the shelf, easily self-assembled and installed without needs for certification, not imposing greatly on its residency (smaller than 100cmx150cm) or producing much noise. The high manufacturability of Briareo allows the use of the low cost rotational moulding industrial process. 

The technology has reached a TRL of 6 and Phase 1 project aims at establishing a robust industrialization and operational plan, at identifying all stakeholders in the value chain securing appropriate suppliers, sale channels and strategic partnerships, at contacting potential early adopters’ communities that can ensure a quick market test and at strengthening the business model with an in-depth market analysis, sound marketing strategy and reliable financial projections.

In 2009, the European Union adopted a ‘climate and energy package’ including that at least 20% of EU gross final energy consumption have to come from renewable energy sources until 2020. The challenge of RICAS2020 is given by intermittent renewable energy sources which require increased energy storage to time shift this energy to meet daily demand. As a consequence, the demand for technologies for providing and storing energy is consequently increasing. 
The RICAS2020 Design Study for the European Underground Research Infrastructure related to Advanced Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage (AA-CAES) will provide concepts to set-up a research infrastructure dedicated to underground storage of very high amounts of green energy. The big advantage of the new concepts will be that the underground energy storage can be performed independently from the encountered geological conditions and also at all places where high energy demand exists. 
AA-CAES collects the heat produced by compression and returns it to the air when the air is expanded to generate power and thus delivers higher efficiencies via a zero-carbon process. The Design Study RICAS2020 will provide concepts on the key criteria and focus on technical, legal, institutional and financial requirements of such a research facility and will be open for the whole European Research Area, especially for all research fields close to Energy Providers and Suppliers.

Regularly, huge data centers are opened for storage or calculation of numerical data. Needs, including calculation power, are becoming increasingly important, which explains the creation and implementation of more and more of these data centers. However, the past few years have shown that these clusters are particularly energy-consuming not only because of the calculations but also because of the cooling systems.

The idea is to sale processing power on the cloud. The calculations are smartly distributed to a remote computing grid. The grid is composed of calculation units that are actually electric heaters. The heat is produced by the processors that perform the computing.

Qarnot computing sales cloud HPC on one end, and refunds  the electricity used by electric heaters on the other end. This solution allows Qarnot to build progressively a scalable computing grid avoiding the massive investments of a data center. Furthermore, there is no need to cool the infrastructure as the heat is directly used for heating purposes. Seasonality has already been taken into account by using CPU low power mode, install calculation units in strategic hosts such as schools that are closed during summer. In addition, computing power demand is seasonal, there is less jobs to perform during summer. Qarnot computing grid will be able to guarantee all year long a certain capacity, the extra power will be offered for free to universities and will be used as an adjustment variable (to meet the needs for calculation and the needs for heat).

Qarnot can therefore propose a very energy efficient cloud HPC for reasonable prices. This is one key to address the HPC market which already represents billions of euros.

On the one hand, strategies will be assessed that assure a thermal balance among diffused heat generation, storage and utilization. On the other, policies will be elaborated to decide when energy is to be gathered locally or exchanged (both purchased and sold) with the electricity and gas networks.
The optimal management of such new generation networks will lead to a synergic effect on primary energy savings (hence on the reduction of the CO2 emissions), assuring at the same time investment and operation profitability.

However, the quantification of paper devices signals by colorimetry, electrochemistry or fluorescence entails the use of sensors and electronic components that require energy to function. Up to now, this has been solved by the use of battery-powered bulky readers, but this is only cost-effective when the reader is meant to be used thousands of times (hospital, care rooms, etc). It is becoming clear that the proliferation of paper-based sensors and their enormous potential impact when applied to personalized healthcare ask for innovative solutions that provide affordable readout. Despite dedicated on-chip solutions that integrate all the required components within a disposable test seem to be the most promising approach, available examples of realization are still scarce.

The novel and tunable optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials are a very promising but still challenging route to achieve this goal. In this project, we propose to combine the advantages of two important nanoscale materials, semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and two-dimensional atomic layered (2-D) materials, to realize high-efficiency hybrid solar cells. Quantum dots are one of the best absorbing and carrier photogenerators due to multiple exciton generation and their size-tunable and direct band gap, however, their poor dot-to-dot conductivity has been a major limitation for photovoltaic devices. We propose to overcome this limitation by intercalating 2-D materials that have shown high charge mobility and strong optoelectronic properties. We propose a tandem configuration based on a stack of QD layers for strong carrier photogeneration, with intercalated 2-D atomic layers for efficient charge and photocurrent extraction. We will study the charge transfer and separation at the interface of QDs and 2-D layers, both of which are strongly affected by quantum confinement. The co-supervisors of this project, Prof. Konstantatos and Prof. Koppens at ICFO, have demonstrated a QD/2-D(graphene) phototransistor with a photoresponse up to 5 orders of magnitude higher than phototransistors based on single graphene or MoS2 atomic layers without QDs, showing the potential of QD/2-D hybrid devices for photovoltaics. In addition to QDs, we will also use small band gap materials, such as phosphorene and other 2-D semiconductors that can harvest energy from infrared hot sources in dark conditions. The proposed hybrid QD/2-D solar cell architecture can have a strong technological impact since both materials can be produced in large scale by chemical synthesis and surpass the performance of current photovoltaic technologies.",158121.6,158121.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2014,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,FUNDACIO INSTITUT DE CIENCIES FOTONIQUES,ES,,,

A first step in this direction is the development and installation of a flexible smart metering architecture for multiple energy vectors. Up to now the smart meters that in some countries are being installed at the users are nearly only devoted to billing improvements. The new metering systems must go much further to provide their contribution to various objectives such as end-user affordability of electricity, energy and market efficiency improvement, CO2 emissions and pollutants reduction. In the FLEXMETER project a flexible, multi-utility, multi-service metering architecture will be designed and deployed in two demonstrators. Simple off-the-shelf meters will be placed at the users for electric, thermal and gas metering; they will communicate with a building concentrator, where the “smartness” of the metering system will reside. A central cloud system will collect data from the building concentrators and from MV/LV substation meters. Data collection, fusion and mining algorithms will be adopted. The proposed architecture will allow for innovative services for the prosumers (e.g. analysis of the energy consumption), for the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) (e.g. fault detection, network balancing and storage integration) and for the retail market. Also demand side management devices could be plugged into the system. In the FLEXMETER project two pilot applications in two different countries (Italy and Sweden), on real systems, with the involvement of the local DSOs and volunteer prosumers will be demonstrated. The results on the demonstrators will then be scaled up to the size of the cities in order to evaluate the advantages on a real scale.",3869607.25,3197791.38,H2020-LCE-2014-3,IA,POLITECNICO DI TORINO,IT,E.ON SVERIGE AB;IREN ENERGIA SPA;INSTITUT POLYTECHNIQUE DE GRENOBLE;RHEINISCH-WESTFAELISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE AACHEN;SIVECO ROMANIA SA;UNIVERSITATEA POLITEHNICA DIN BUCURESTI;ALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITA DI BOLOGNA;IREN SPA;STMICROELECTRONICS SRL;TELECOM ITALIA SPA;JRC -JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE- EUROPEAN COMMISSION,SE;IT;FR;DE;RO;BE,

This enables retrofitting in houses with old, high temperature radiators, while achieving a Seasonal COP (SCOP) of over 130%. The solution can easily be combined with solar thermal collectors to achieve a SCOP of up to 170%.

Working already with major OEMs like GE and Alfa Laval in other applications, ClimateWell is targeting the European gas boiler OEMs such as Vaillant, BDR and Ariston to develop a Gas Heat Pump (GHP) product in which ClimateWell’s HeatBoost component is integrated.

It potentially saves more than 33% of the natural gas consumption (500 EUR per year) for a typical European household using a condensing gas boiler today. The cost premium can be paid off in less than 4 years, making it an attractive investment for the end-user.

While the target market for domestic space heating in Europe is huge with an installed base of 90 million boilers and over 8 million sold every year, the potential environmental impact is even bigger with a total reduction of CO2 footprint of 61.5 million tonnes/year.

In this 6-month Feasibility Study, ClimateWell will verify the technical and commercial feasibility of integrating ClimateWell’s new sorption component into a gas boiler system. The goal is to establish collaboration with leading European boiler manufacturers for the continued development of a GHP product and apply for funding of a Phase 2 project.
A successful outcome of the project means that once the GHP product has been commercialised in 3-5 years, ClimateWell’s potential revenue for providing some 2 million HeatBoost components per year to boiler manufacturers is 1 billion EUR.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,SALTX TECHNOLOGY AB,SE,,,

This culminates in reduced aerodynamic efficiency and increased structural vibrations, which are noisy and reduce the operating life of aerodynamic devices. To delay flow separations and dynamic stalling, flow control is engaged either actively (artificial means) or passively (natural means). This project describes a novel passive flow control method (Aeropaft) to be applied primarily in the wind turbine (WT) industry, then to aircraft and ground and marine vehicles.
Wind energy is the fastest growing Renewable Energy source (RES) at 24.4% per year. To keep pace with growing demand, there is need for advanced technologies to increase the aerodynamic efficiency. Aeropaft is a simple technology exploiting high velocity currents from near the leading edge (via internal ducts) to re-energise the free-stream flow at the top of an aerofoil. This results in a 5% increase in electrical power yield for a 1MW WT, increase in lift (~16%), reduction of profile drag force (~7%) at higher aerofoil angles of incidences (>12o), and the reduction of wear caused by vibrations. We will penetrate 1% of the global WT market and 10% of the European market. Licensed Manufacturers stand to gain a 0.33% increase in market value and revenue of €1.72bn, while utility companies gain €101,013 per annum through savings and increased energy output per WT. Our revenue will come through licensing at 0.2% of the whole turbine cost translating to revenue of €10.3m and profits of €7.72m, five years post commercialization.
Phase 1 will entail a market study, partner search, assessing structural integrity issues and developing an IP and commercialisation strategy.
Phase 2 will be to modify blades of existing WTs with our technology and test demonstrate in the operational environment.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEINST-1-2014,SME-1,JARILO LIMITED,UK,,,

This topic is one of the keys for enhancing both the performance of TOLAE components and addresses some of the main technology barriers of TOLAE: lifetime and cost-performance-ratio.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules have been chosen as test objects for a scalable and general approach suitable also for other TOLAE devices. Monolithical integration of barrier foils means in this case that the full device is made immediately on top of ultra-barrier coated plastic foil, which further is coated with a transparent electrode. This leads to significant cost reduction, which is one of the key needs for wider use of TOLAE devices.
The project ALABO develops direct laser scribing processes on flexible substrates, coated with ultra-barrier systems. The project results will be applicable to a number of TOLAE technologies, such as OPV, OLED, OTFT and thin-film inorganic PV on polymer foil substrates. The consortium will investigate and develop new manufacturing processes, which will increase the performance and functionality of TOLAE devices suitable for smart systems. OPV can be part of such smart TOLAE systems. By developing direct laser structuring on top of such ultra-barrier foil, the consortium develops advanced materials, as well as new production technologies supported by dedicated monitoring and material testing technologies for well-scalable manufacturing processes.

DARWIN will improve response to expected and unexpected crises affecting critical infrastructures and social structures. It addresses the management of both man-made events (e.g. cyber-attacks) and natural events (e.g. earthquakes).  

The main objective is the development of European resilience management guidelines. These will improve the ability of stakeholders to anticipate, monitor, respond, adapt, learn and evolve, to operate efficiently in the face of crises. Guidelines will be presented in formats for easy usage and maintenance to avoid them being dust-collectors on a shelf. To enable dynamic, user-friendly guidelines the project will adapt innovative tools (e.g. serious gaming, training packages), test and validate the guidelines, and establish knowledge about how organisations can implement guidelines to improve resilience. 

A multidisciplinary approach is applied, involving experts in the field of resilience, crisis and risk management, social media and service providers in the Air Traffic Management and health care domains. To ensure transnational, cross-sector applicability, long-term relevance and uptake of project results, a Community of Crisis and Resilience Practitioners (CoCRP) will be established, including stakeholders and end-users from other domains and critical infrastructures and resilience experts. The CoCRP will be involved in an iterative evaluation process to provide feedback on the guidelines.

The target beneficiaries of DARWIN are crisis management actors and stakeholders responsible for public safety, such as critical infrastructures and service providers, which might be affected by a crisis, as well as the public and media.

Energy demand and energy generation by prosumers are volatile and can impact the grid infrastructure and stakeholders, but they can be flexibly adapted to thwart those impacts.
Flex4Grid aims at creating an open data and service framework that enables a novel concept of managing flexibility of prosumer demand and generation, utilising cloud computing for power grid management and, opening DSO infrastructure for aggregator services. The system will be built up from existing ICT components developed by the consortium partners over many years in research projects on IoT and Cloud computing. This high maturity allows Flex4Grid to aim for a system prototype of TRL 7 which guarantees a maximum impact and competitiveness in the area of the smart grid challenge.
The Flex4Grid system will include a) a data cloud service with anonymised interface and advanced security and privacy mechanisms for data exchange and service management, b) prosumer generation and demand flexibility, and c) a more viable business model to accelerate the deployment. The major innovations are a) opening the market for new entrants by secure and privacy enabling third party cloud data and energy management services, b) actionable common and multilevel data management and analytics services for Smart Grids, and c) the use of co-creation to bring end users into the value creation process.

This is partly attributed to the challenges for financing renewable energy projects. Reduced access to conventional financing options over the past few years has triggered innovative financing schemes to emerge, with crowdfunding attracting a lot of attention.

CrowdFundRES recognises the vast potential of crowdfunding for financing renewable energy projects. The project has been developed for and in cooperation with the three target groups:
1) Renewable energy project developers whose access to financing is getting more challenging
2) The part of the public that has an interest in investing even very small amounts of their savings in renewable energy projects
3) Crowdfunding platforms who act as intermediaries facilitating the financial transaction between the public and the project developers.

The overall objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the acceleration of the renewable energy growth in Europe by unleashing the potential of crowdfunding for financing renewable energy projects. In order to achieve this, the work has been structured for achieving the following objectives:
1. Gain a deep understanding of the public’s perception of crowdfunding
2. Analyse the challenges faced by the application of crowdfunding for renewable energy projects in Europe
3. Develop guidelines that support easier, more effective and wider accepted practices in crowdfunding renewable energy projects
4. Apply the guidelines and review them based on practical experience

The HEAT proposal brings together Europe's leading researchers on homomorphic cryptography (KU LEUVEN, UNIVBRIS and UL), with the leading expertise on lattice based cryptanalysis (UPMC), and three industrial partners with existing interests in the field (CRX, NXP and Thales UK). The goal of HEAT is to produce a step change in the efficiency and applicability of this technology. The proposal leverages existing ground breaking research in Europe, and links this with three industrially contributed case studies as a way of grounding the research in practical issues. 

The case studies proposed by the industrial partners consist of smart grid, statistical analysis to automate the detection of organized crime and shared satellite infrastructure applications.

The project will focus on Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE). Not only is this a stepping stone on the way to Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the partners also believe that SHE is a useful cryptographic tool in its own right. We aim to demonstrate this applicability via our three case studies.

Motivated by the three case studies the project will examine new design and implementation techniques for homomorphic cryptography, as well as a thorough security analysis. The security analysis is likely to have wider applicability due to the linkage with post-quantum cryptographic systems based on lattices. The proposed outputs of HEAT are an open source software library to support applications that wish to use homomorphic cryptography.

Thanks to pioneering coupling systems, up to 8 ESPRIT vehicles can be nested together in a road train, 7 being towed for an efficient redistribution of fleets and a smartly-balanced and cost efficient transport system. Within the project, 2 user scenarios are foreseen: a one-way carsharing system within city centres and a last-kilometre personal mobility system to existing public transport infrastructures in peri-urban areas.

To prove the ESPRIT concept, the project will also work on modelling and simulation tools to predict, once ESPRIT vehicles are deployed, the economic, social and environmental benefits as well as key operating strategies.
This concept will incite citizens to use public transport and carsharing solutions rather than their private vehicles leading to seamless intermodal transport, decongestion, significant reduction of noise and air pollution.

It aims to help accelerating the R&D efforts into silicon solar cells, the dominating PV technology with a persistent market share of around 90%. Basis for this forms “Quokka”, a multidimensional silicon solar cell simulation tool recently developed by the applicant. Quokka is specifically designed for silicon solar cell conditions, which allows for valid simplifications to the general semiconductor modelling approaches, and sets it apart from generally more powerful commercial software and other free tools in terms of computational speed and ease of setup. Since its release for free early 2013, Quokka sees a rapid increase of usage amongst all major PV research institutes and manufacturers.
Within this project, the applicant will grow Quokka from its (capable) childhood to a mature simulation tool, being supported by the world-leading expertise in solar cells of the host institution, Fraunhofer ISE. One measure consists in coding optimized numeric routines to efficiently handle much larger mesh sizes, e.g. enabling the unprecedented and very useful capability of simulating a full size silicon solar cell. Furthermore, several physical models of highest future relevance will be identified, experimentally validated and added to Quokka’s capabilities. Accessibility to PV scientists, engineers and students in Europe and worldwide forms a key point of this project, and will be achieved by publishing underlying algorithms and validation cases, and by continued free hosting, integration and documentation on the leading web-portal for solar cell modeling.

In bioenergy production the solid fuel quality and especially moisture content and share of foreign matter are the key parameters. The water content of the fuel is a parameter used in the regulations of some manufacturers to manage the settings of a biomass boiler. But it is also essential for verifying energy content of the fuel delivered to the power plant which is base for fuel pricing. Solid biofuels often contains foreign matter such as stones, sand, soil and also metals that lowers energy content and increases operation and maintenance costs in the power plant. High moisture content and amount of foreign matter in biofuels increases operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for the whole production chain.

Despite their enormous potential for RES, in practice many farmers are not capable of accessing the financial, technical and administrative resources required for installing RES capacity on their farms. This is caused by RES investments generally being restricted to project finance for large installations while RES types that can be installed on farms require bank loans. This limitation greatly restricts capital supply while raising overall cost. Most farms in the targeted countries have a low credit profile that disqualifies them for loans. To overcome this limitation and fully take advantage of the last few years´ cost reductions and performance advancements in RES, a tailored investment instrument is needed that can attract capital from capital markets and especially from institutional investors to on-farm RES. The recent appearance of innovative investment schemes, addressed to overcome similar challenges in other sectors, demonstrates that, by creating pools of RES, access to capital market resources can be realized. The proposed action is designed to initiate a structured dialogue among farmers, financiers and other relevant experts and stakeholders in order to develop and promote such an investment instrument, tailored for on-farm RES.

Specific application needs, such as latency or protection requirements, are seldom guaranteed, because they are usually implicit and even when they are not, the need of the grooming layer to map large numbers of small flows into the small numbers of very large and static lightpaths is an obstacle to effective service fulfillment.

ACINO proposes a novel application-centric network concept, which differentiates the service offered to each application all the way down to the optical layer, thereby overcoming the disconnect that the grooming layer causes between service requirements and their fulfillment in the optical layer. This allows catering to the needs of emerging medium-large applications, such as database migration in data centers. To realize this vision, ACINO aims to develop an open source, vendor-agnostic modular orchestrator, which will expose to applications a set of high level primitives for specifying service requirements, and then perform multi-layer (IP and optical) planning and optimization processes to map these requirements into a set of lightpaths. The orchestrator will also be able to perform re-optimization, by means of a novel online in-operation planning module. The ACINO consortium has strong industrial foundations, and plans to demonstrate the advantages of its approach in a testbed with commercial equipment in a carrier environment.

ACINO’s approach directly addresses the lack of dynamic control of optical networks, by automating planning and configuration tasks, and tackles the limitations in inter data center connectivity by allowing applications to request detailed and complex custom services to be provisioned in a timely manner.

Plants are sessile organisms that have developed very flexible strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions as heat, cold, drought and salt stress. These stresses cause protein misfolding and aggregation resulting in plant damage/death and productivity losses. Recycling of damaged proteins is achieved by the action of molecular chaperones. But when recycling is not possible, toxic aggregated proteins have to be degraded by the action of proteases to avoid cellular damage. Chaperones and proteases act coordinately and constitute the protein quality control system that is essential for plant survival. In plant chloroplasts, the chaperone Hsp70 is known to posttranslationally regulate important processes like photosynthesis. It is known that the specificity of Hsp70 is determined by its J-protein partners, adaptors that recognize unfolded substrates and transfer them to the chaperone for refolding. However, little is known about the target proteins of Hsp70, such that there is a large lack of information about how chloroplastic enzymes are regulated at protein levels. This knowledge is crucial for rational engineering of specific molecular pathways and plant fitness improvement. The ability to specifically alter plant metabolism without undesirable effects is a fundamental demand of European society and addresses current concerns about transgenic plants. This proposal aims to cover this gap by discovering and validating interactors of chloroplastic J-proteins.

This plant configuration is based on a multi-tower decoupled advanced solar combined cycle approach that not only increases cycle efficiencies but also avoids frequent transients and inefficient partial loads, thus maximizing overall efficiency, reliability as well as dispatchability, all of which are important factors directly related to cost competitiveness on the power market. The core topic of the project, the innovative solar receiver, will be an open volumetric receiver allowing operating temperatures beyond 1200 ºC, providing the absorbed solar heat to the pressurized air circuit of the Brayton cycle via a network of fixed bed regenerative heat exchangers working in alternating modes (non-pressurized heating period, pressurized cooling period).",6461970.43,6104032.93,H2020-LCE-2014-1,RIA,FUNDACION CENER,ES,"FCT INGENIEURKERAMIK GMBH;FUNDACION TEKNIKER;ELECTRICITE DE FRANCE;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES;FCT HARTBEARBEITUNGS GMBH;EUREC EESV;CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIONES ENERGETICAS, MEDIOAMBIENTALES Y TECNOLOGICAS-CIEMAT;QUERDENKFABRIK AG;HAVER & BOECKER OHG;BLUEBOX ENERGY LTD;TSK FLAGSOL ENGINEERING GMBH;K CONTROLS LTD;SOCIETE INDUSTRIELLE DE SONCEBOZ SA;CERA SYSTEM VERSCHLEIßSCHUTZ GMBH",DE;ES;FR;BE;CH;UK,

However the potential of wave energy is vast, and also positive conclusions have been drawn, in particular that wave energy is generally technically feasible. 
Having substantial insight into successes and drawbacks in past developments and existing concepts, the promoters have identified ‘breakthrough features’ that address the above mentioned obstacles, i.e. components, systems and processes, as well as the respective IP. These breakthroughs are applied to two wave concepts, the OWC and the Symphony, under development by members of the consortium. The following main avenues have been identified:

 1. Survivability breakthrough via device submergence under storm conditions;
 2. O&M (operation and maintenance) breakthrough via continuous submergence and adaption of components and strategies;
 3. PTO breakthrough via dielectric membrane alternatives to the “classical” electro-mechanical power take-off equipment;
 4. Array breakthrough via sharing of mooring and electrical connections between nearby devices, as well as integral approach to device interaction and compact aggregates;

WETFEET addressees Low-carbon Energies specific challenges by targeting a set of breakthroughs for wave energy technology, an infant clean energy technology with vast potential.

All hydrogen fuel cells use precious (rare and expensive) metal catalysts to oxidise H2, and reduce O2, such as Pt. These “precious” metals currently prevent the widespread use of fuel cells. The US Department of Energy has set a target of 0.125g of Pt / kW energy produced from fuel cells, and a total cost of $30 /kW. The current record stands at 0.2 g Pt/kW and a cost of $36/kW. The automotive industry requires the current Pt content of fuel cells to be reduced by 1/3 to become economically viable. Pt is a major cost component and is clearly a problem. This project develops a way to reduce Pt content of fuel cells by half – falling well below DoE targets and those of the automotive industry. We do this by replacing rare and expensive Pt metal used to oxidize H2 on 1 side of the fuel cell with molecular catalysts made of B, C, Cl, and F elements – cheap and abundant materials!
The molecular catalysts that we have developed form “frustrated Lewis pairs” (FLP). A suitable Lewis acid and a Lewis base when combined form an FLP which can be used to heterolytically split H2. The resulting Lewis acid hydride is then oxidized at a carbon electrode, and the energetic driving force required to oxidise H2 into 2 H\ and 2e– is greatly reduced by as much as 610 mV (equivalent to catalyzing the reaction by 118 kJ mol-1) without using any Pt. This proposal seeks to build on this pioneering work. We have found that FLP reactions can occur at very electron deficient Lewis acids without needing a Lewis base! Instead we can use a common organic solvent, tetrahydrofuran, as the Lewis base, and form water tolerant Lewis acid catalysts, that cleave hydrogen in seconds on the same timescale as electrooxidation. This fund will allow us to develop aqueous FLP arylborane electrocatalysts and build prototype “frustrated fuel cells” as clean, cheap, energy  devices.",149533.75,149533.75,ERC-2014-PoC,ERC-POC,UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA,UK,,,

However, the present state of the art does not ensure neither a good return of investment nor a sustainable and efficient power system. The work so far in the EU involves mainly larger stakeholders, namely power utilities and manufacturers more focused on production and grid resources. A closer attention to the demand side of the system is required, and especially in the interaction with the new methods for SG management.
Efficient power systems require the optimal use of the available resources to cope with demand requirements and Demand Response (DR) programs with adequate business models can leverage demand flexibility both on centralized and distributed models, as renewable energygeneration is highly dependable of uncontrolled factors (as wind and solar radiation) for which anticipated forecasts are hardly trustful.

The primary research aim is to develop a sustainable WES for a variety of EU needs. There are a number of detailed scientific and technical issues that will be addressed by the project starting from identifying the wind energy potential (off-shore and on-shore, including the built environment) to the design of a sustainable and highly efficient WES. Also the new challenging load conditions imposed on wind farms located on places where existing type of wind turbine towers are not suitable require the development of new type of support structures for wind energy converters. This fosters new structural concepts taking advantage of high performance materials e.g. high strength steel and novel maintenance free fasteners. In addition, while most research efforts and practical applications of wind energy have focused on large-scale wind installations in remote offshore or onshore areas, much less attention has been given to wind energy installations near buildings. The project has a major training aim to create technical experts who will be able to lead the necessary industrial developments in the WES, and have a broad overview of a new and emerging multi-disciplinary field.

Nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvesters, also known as nanogenerators (NGs), can directly convert small scale ambient vibrations into electrical energy. Scavenging power from ubiquitous vibrations in this way offers an attractive route to supersede fixed power sources such as batteries that need replacing/recharging, and that do not scale with the diminishing size of modern electronics. This proposal aims to develop NGs for future self-powered smart devices. Ceramics such as lead zirconium titanate and semiconductors such as zinc oxide are the most widely used piezoelectric EH materials. This proposal however focuses on a different class of piezoelectric materials, namely ferroelectric polymers, such as polyvinlyidene fluoride (PVDF), its copolymers, and nylon. These are potentially superior EH materials as they are flexible, robust, lightweight, easy and cheap to fabricate, as well as being lead-free and bio-compatible. The key strategy of this proposal is in combining i) materials engineering to create novel piezoelectric polymer-ceramic nanocomposite materials with enhanced EH functionalities, ii) state-of-the art nanoscale characterization to explore and exploit these novel materials, and iii) fabrication of high performance NGs for implementation into commercial devices, using insight gained from modelling of materials and device parameters.

Improvements are therefore urgently needed to combat related health issues, alleviate poverty and develop the local recycling sector.
EWIT project’s aim is to address these challenges, assisting African municipalities in the implementation of effective e-waste management systems for their communities.
The project will develop a comprehensive mapping of the baseline data of African metropolitan areas related to e-waste management, analyzing the most relevant experiences, processes and legal tools available. It will then deliver a dynamic and easy to use information and service portal to offer guidance and practical support for the design and development of e-waste collection and recycling systems.
EWIT will generate the expected impacts through 5 coordinated work packages. The working model is based on two different set of workshops, one led by “Cities” and the other by “Experts”. Tools, implementation models, policies and procedures will feed a dedicated information and service platform called “E-waste implementation toolkit”. This dynamic and easy to use internet portal will be a strategic source of knowledge for decision makers at industry and local government level. Dissemination will play a key role to assure that the project’s deliverables are well understood and ready to be applied.

The INREP philosophy is to meet this challenge by addressing the whole value chain via an application focused research programme aiming at developing tailor made solutions for each targeted application.
This programme will produce a complete evaluation of the relevant properties of the proposed TCOs, including the impact of deposition technique, and by doing so, devise optimum processes for their application in selected, high value application areas.

However, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.

In COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management.

However, the inherent volatility of most of these energy sources requires both the installation of fast fossil backup power and large amounts of storage capacity. In the ERC funded project GREENEST the fundamentals of an ultra-wet gas turbine cycle are developed. In the proposed project BlueStep :  Blue Combustion for the Storage of Green Electrical Power, the idea of ultra-wet combustion is extended towards the demonstration of a very effective and clean energy storage and conversion technology. Excess renewable electrical energy is utilized in a high pressure electrolysis process to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Both gases are stored at high pressure and their combustion, referred to as blue combustion, can be directly incorporated in existing base load steam power plants, resulting in the BlueStep cycle. Combustion takes place in the steam cycle of the plant and the exhaust gases consist solely of steam that can further expand in the remaining stages of the closed steam cycle. Depending on the mode of application, the power output of the plant and the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced significantly. The proposed BlueStep cycle outclasses competing technologies in terms of efficiency, flexibility, space requirements, and investment costs. In a highly conservative market sector the proposed technology offers an economical and efficient method to realize extensive energy storage. The proposal comprises two key aspects: (1) the demonstration of diluted hydrogen-oxygen combustion under engine conditions to prove the technical feasibility of the technique to future customers; and (2) the development of a thorough business plan for the construction and operation of a full scale BlueStep energy storage plant to show the high economic potential of the concept to future investors.",150000.0,150000.0,ERC-2014-PoC,ERC-POC,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN,DE,,,

However, these materials are too expensive for the use in flat-plat modules. Nanowires allow to significantly reduce material needs without compromising absorption or performance. The consortium has already shown InP single-junction nanowire solar cells on InP substrate, reaching world-record efficiencies of 13.8 % and using only 12 % of the volume of a conventional bulk solar cell.

Each material/sub solar cell converts a specific part of the sun´s spectrum and thus manages the photons properly. However, large area multi-junction cells are too expensive if applied in standard PV modules. A viable solution to solve the cost issue is to use tiny solar cells in combination with optical concentrating technology, in particular, high concentrating photovoltaics (HCPV), in which the light is concentrated over the solar cells more than 500 times. The combination of ultra-high efficient cells and optical concentration lead to low cost on system level and eventually to low levelised electricity costs, today well below 8 €cent/kWh and at the end of this project below 5 €cent/kWh. Therefore, to achieve an optimised PV system (high efficiency, low cost and low environmental impact), world-wide well-known partners in the field of CPV technology propose this project to run and progress together the development of highly-efficient MJ solar cells and the improvement of the concentrator (CPV module) technique.

The central objective of the project is to realise HCPV solar cells and modules working at a concentration level ≥800x with world record efficiency of 48 % and 40 %, respectively, hence bringing practical performances closer to theoretical limits. This should be achieved through novel MJ solar cell architectures using advanced materials and processes for better spectral matching as well as through innovative HCPV module concepts with improved optical and interconnection designs, thus including novel light management approaches.

MNP will be used, where the plasmonic resonance will be tailored to the luminescent species to downshift UV.

As key components of the Earth’s carbon cycle and marine food webs we need to understand the eco-evolutionary underpinnings of their ecological success to forecast their fate in a future ocean impacted by anthropogenic change. Genomes and epigenomes from model diatoms, as well as hundreds of transcriptomes from multiple species, have revealed genetic and epigenetic processes regulating gene expression in response to changing environments. The Tara Oceans survey has in parallel generated resources to explore diatom abundance, diversity and gene expression in the world’s ocean in widely contrasting conditions. DIATOMIC will build on these resources to understand how evolutionary and ecological processes combine to influence diatom adaptations to their environment at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. To examine these processes over timescales relevant to current climate change, DIATOMIC includes the pioneering exploration of ancient diatom DNA from the sub-seafloor to reveal the genetic and epigenetic bases of speciation and adaptation that have impacted their ecological success during the last 100,000 years, when Earth experienced major climatological events and an increase in anthropogenic impacts. As a model for exploring eco-evolutionary processes in the past and contemporary ocean we will focus primarily on Chaetoceros because this diatom genus is ancient, ubiquitous, abundant and contributes significantly to carbon export. Key findings will be additionally supported by lab-based studies using the diatom Phaeodactylum for which exemplar molecular tools exist. Specifically, the project will address:

A holistic approach is proposed to produce cost-competitive biobutanol from 3 types of lignocellulosic biomass and waste in a sustainable way being flexible to accommodate regionally specific feedstocks.
Project exploitable outputs include:
(1)novel low CAPEX two-step pretreatment process that releases hemicellulose and cellulose from recalcitrant feedstocks for further enzymatic and/or fermentation processing,
(2)new tailored enzyme cocktail yielding highly fermentable sugars at low enzyme dosages and lower cost,
(3)superior clostridial strains with enhanced production characteristics i.e. butanol and inhibitor tolerance,
(4)high productivity fermentation process including a novel in-situ product recovery step. 
Technology advances allow sustainable feedstock diversification, improve conversion yields and efficiency, reduce energy requirements, and water usage.

As such, it supplies our food and dominates land and water usage by humanity. In agriculture, where water and nutrients are abundant, the rate of carbon fixation often limits growth rate. Therefore increasing the rate of carbon fixation is of global importance towards agricultural and energetic sustainability.
What are the limits on the possible rate of carbon fixation? Attempts to improve RuBisCO, the key enzyme in the Calvin-Benson cycle, have achieved only limited results. My lab focuses on trying to overcome this global challenge by building synthetic pathways for carbon fixation. We create a computational framework that designs and scores pathways and creates step-wise selection strategies for in-vivo experimental implementation. Our most promising synthetic carbon fixation pathways are found to utilize the highly effective carboxylating enzyme, PEP carboxylase. We experimentally test these pathways in the most genetically tractable context by constructing an E.coli strain that depends on atmospheric CO2 fixation. We will gradually incorporate the pathways, initially as essential reaction steps for biomass production, and finally with CO2 as sole carbon input of the cell.
As a stepping-stone towards this challenging goal, we will construct an autotrophic E.coli strain that uses the Calvin-Benson cycle. We systematically convert this synthetic biology grand challenge into a gradual evolutionary ladder with independently selectable steps. We recently achieved key steps in the ladder, such as semi-autotrophic growth, serving as powerful proofs of concept.
The proposed research will advance our basic-science understanding of evolutionary plasticity of metabolic pathways.

The EU priority of increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources in the power system has led to the wide acceptance of the smart grid paradigm as the solution for several emerging challenges. Another EU priority is the creation of a Pan-European Energy Market. A relevant step was taken in 2015 with the coupling of several regional European markets. Despite the significant investments in the fields of smart grids and electricity markets, the two fronts are evolving quite independently from each other, evidencing the sector difficulties in profiting from the strong relationships among them. A relevant drawback is the lack of decision support solutions to enable involved players improving their outcomes from energy transactions. ADAPT tackles this gap by proposing a multi-agent decision support system to assist the negotiation process of smart grid and electricity market players. ADAPT is composed by: (i) a portfolio optimization that identifies the most gainful negotiation opportunities, considering the available markets, including negotiations at a smart grid level; and (ii) a decision support method for actual negotiations using novel machine learning approaches to choose the most suitable strategies for each context, considering opponents’ negotiation profiles. ADAPT’s quality and industry-driven nature is assured by the experience and complementary expertise of the candidate and host in the targeted fields, and is further enhanced by the participation of experts in the fields of artificial intelligence and power systems. Besides advancing in the multidisciplinary research fields, ADAPT is expected to impact the EU power sector, the industry and society as a whole, by contributing to the effective integration of smart grids in a market environment, and to the decrease of electricity prices through competitiveness.",170121.6,170121.6,H2020-MSCA-IF-2015,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSIDAD DE SALAMANCA,ES,,,

The research of various solar cell concepts for diversified applications (building integrated PVs, powering mobile devices) has recently resulted in many innovations. However, designs and concepts of solar cells fulfilling stringent criteria of efficiency, stability, low prize, flexibility, transparency, tunable cell size, esthetics, are still lacking.  
Herein, the research focus is given to a new physical concept of a solar cell that explores extremely promising materials, yet unseen and unexplored in a joint device, whose combination may solve traditional solar cells drawbacks (carrier recombination, narrow light absorption). 
It features a high surface area interface (higher than any other known PVs concept) based on ordered anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays, homogenously infilled with nanolayers of high absorption coefficient crystalline chalcogenide or organic chromophores using different techniques, yet unexplored for this purpose. After addition of supporting constituents, a solid-state solar cell with an extremely large incident area for the solar light absorption and optimized electron pathways will be created. The CHROMTISOL solar cell concept bears a large potential to outperform existing thin film photovoltaic technologies and concepts due to unique combination of materials and their complementary properties. 

The project aims towards important scientific findings in highly interdisciplinary fields. Being extremely challenging and in the same time risky, it is based on feasible ideas and steps, that will result in exciting achievements.

However, the technological advances and urgent environmental and sustainable energy issues such as CO2 capture and separation, energy storage and conversion (photovoltatic system, supercapacitor etc) call for advanced materials with not only properties of individual layers but also new functionalities. Particularly, researches on superstructures with unique properties such as amphiphilicity still remain blank. Physically, it is now possible to create such hybrid superstructures by placing different 2D crystals on top of each other in a designed sequence; while engineering the 2D units through a chemical way endows a high flexibility in surface chemistry tailoring and increase the mechanical stability due to the strongly bonded interface. Taking these into consideration, here we propose a combined chemical-physical pathway to engineer task-specific, mechanically freestanding superstructures based on 2D atomic planes in a simple and scalable manner. Three new material concepts are proposed including amphiphilic superstructure (hydrophilic outer layer and hydrophobic inner layer), gas selective superstructure (CO2-phililc outer layer and gas shape selective inner layer) and flexible superstructure with outer layer functionalized with metal oxide nanoparticles confined in ordered mesopores and inner conductive graphene.

All kinds of conversion strategies including photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar to fuel and others would benefit from efficiently collecting solar power on large areas. For this reason luminescent solar concentrators have been developed for over thirty years, but due to waveguide losses their maximum size is still limited to a few centimeters.

The proposed project suggests the exploitation of a new type of electromagnetic waveguide in order to realize passive planar concentrators of unsurpassed collection efficiency, size, concentration, lifetime and costs.
 
A dielectric TE1-mode shows a node, a position in the waveguide where no intensity is found. A thin film placed in this node remains largely “invisible” for the propagating mode. Such dielectric node modes (DNMs) have been investigated by the applicant in previous work, but only recently a silver island film (SIF) was for the first time placed in such a node. The resulting extremely low waveguide losses cannot be explained by our current understanding of waveguide modes and hint to a hybridization between the SIF-bound long-range surface plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) and the DNMs into what we call hybrid node modes (HNMs).
 
The SIFs strongly interact with incident light. An appropriate nanopatterning of SIFs enables efficient excitation of low-loss HNMs modes collecting solar power over square meters and concentrating it. To achieve this goal new technological methods are used that enable patterning on the nanometer scale and low cost roll-to-roll processing at the same time. New measurement techniques and numerical simulation tools will be developed to investigate the HNMs – a novel kind of electromagnetic modes – and their exploitation in the passive solar concentrators.",1485000.0,1485000.0,ERC-2014-STG,ERC-STG,BERGISCHE UNIVERSITAET  WUPPERTAL,DE,,,

However, single junction photovoltaic (PV) cells fail to achieve their theoretical efficiency due to an inability to harness all wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Spectral losses may be overcome through the addition of a spectral converter coating to the surface of a finished PV cell, which, through a photoluminescence process, converts solar photons into wavelengths suitable for use. Nonetheless, spectral converters currently fail to deliver their promise to significantly boost PV cell performance due to the difficulties of translating luminescent molecules (lumophores) from solution into efficient solid-state materials.

By considering the lumophore-host material as an integrated unit, rather than discrete components, in SPECTRACON, I take a radically new approach to the design of spectral converters. Organic-inorganic hybrid polymer hosts incorporating covalently-grafted lumophores will be rationally engineered to deliver spectral converters with the tailored optical, structural, viscoelastic and mechanical properties needed for high performance solid-state conversion, which has so far been unattainable. Using cheap materials and a solution-based process suitable for scalable manufacturing, these spectral converters will be integrated with PV cells to realise next generation luminescent solar devices which display record levels of efficiency and reduced costs.

A scientific breakthrough that demonstrates efficient solar spectral conversion in the solid-state would enable immediate deployment of luminescent solar devices to the commercial market, thus accelerating progress to an all-renewables society and delivering unprecedented impact on the quality of life of future generations. Moreover, the fundamental knowledge gleaned on the design of efficient solid-state emitters will open up new frontiers for application in light-emitting displays, optical storage and sensing.",2124593.0,2124593.0,ERC-2018-COG,ERC-COG,THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARSOF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,UK,,,

While behavioral science research has advanced our understanding of such intergroup conflict, it has exclusively focused on micro-level processes within and between groups at conflict. Disciplines that employ a more historical perspective like climate studies or political geography report that macro-level pressures due to changes in climate or economic scarcity can go along with social unrest and wars. How do these macro-level pressures relate to micro-level processes? Do they both occur independently, or do macro-level pressures trigger micro-level processes that cause intergroup conflict? And if so, which micro-level processes are triggered, and how?

With unavoidable signs of climate change and increasing resource scarcities, answers to these questions are urgently needed. Here I propose carrying-capacity stress (CCS) as the missing link between macro-level pressures and micro-level processes. A group experiences CCS when its resources do not suffice to maintain its functionality. CCS is a function of macro-level pressures and creates intergroup conflict because it impacts micro-level motivation to contribute to one’s group’s fighting capacity and shapes the coordination of individual contributions to out-group aggression through emergent norms, communication and leadership.

To test these propositions I develop a parametric model of CCS that is amenable to measurement and experimentation, and use techniques used in my work on conflict and cooperation: Meta-analyses and time-series analysis of macro-level historical data; experiments on intergroup conflict; and measurement of neuro-hormonal correlates of cooperation and conflict. In combination, this project provides novel multi-level conflict theory that integrates macro-level discoveries in climate research and political geography with micro-level processes uncovered in the biobehavioral sciences",2490382.5,2490382.5,ERC-2017-ADG,ERC-ADG,UNIVERSITEIT LEIDEN,NL,,,

Freshly produced flows and stocks of landfilled industrial residues such as mine tailings, non-ferrous slag and bauxite residue (BR) can provide major amounts of critical metals and, concurrently, minerals for low-carbon building materials. The European Training Network for Zero-Waste Valorisation of Bauxite Residue (REDMUD) therefore targets the vast streams of new and stockpiled BR in the EU-28. BR contains several critical metals, is associated with a substantial management cost, whereas spills have led to major environmental incidents, including the Ajka disaster in Hungary.

Decision-making plays a vital role in these services. But the computational complexity of decision-makings could grow explosively with the size of smart grid infrastructure, the number of devices/users, or the amount of data; If this scalability issue was underestimated, smart grid services can end up with poor performance or limited function, making these services impractical to meet the needs of real-life or industrial-scale deployment.

In June 2018 the EU institutions agreed on a new Renewable Energy Directive for the next decade, including a legally-binding EU-wide target of 32% for renewable energy by 2030 and indicating a biogas production of 50 billion m3 per year as a crucial milestone in achieving this goal. But, yearly biogas production growth rate is on a steady decline, due to the stringent regulations imposed by EU that fix thresholds in the use of energy crops and food-derived biomasses as feedstock for biogas generation plants (mainly Anaerobic Digestion - AD). On the other side, lignocellulosic materials are still not properly exploited since woody wastes are largely unaffected by digestion, as most anaerobic microorganisms are unable to break down lignin. As a consequence, biogas operators cannot use the most available no-food derived raw material in their plants.

THE TECHNOLOGY. 
Finrenes has developed BioFuel Fab, an energy self-sustainable and versatile solution able to make biogas production from lignocellulosic wastes economically profitable and environmentally sustainable. This is achieved thanks to a proprietary high-temperature and high-pressure pretreatment process that makes woody waste suitable for anaerobic digestion. Performances are disruptive: the digestion process speed is increased up to 75%, empowering the AD plant capacity by 3 times. The innovation allows to reach a profitability of biogas production from lignocellulosic waste material to be comparable with energy crops and makes convenient to convert the existing biogas plants using energy crops as feedstock to a BioFuel Fab fed by woody wastes, with a payback for the investment of 2.5 years.",71429.0,50000.0,H2020-SMEInst-2018-2020-1,SME-1,FINRENES OY,FI,,,

The overall research questions of the project are: How do planetary strategies to decarbonize transport act upon the landscapes and societies where a) lithium is extracted, b) turned into technology and c) used and potentially reused and recycled? How can the different ways in which these strategies take place inform non-destructive approaches to collaborative responsible actions to phase out fossil fuels—or decrease their utilization?

Worlds of Lithium will innovatively answer these questions through a transnational documentation of the knowledges and practices through which scientists, grassroots communities, policy makers, and lithium-ion battery producers are differently responding to ecological transformations and disruptions at stake in transitions to sustainable societies. The project will explore such knowledges and practices with a special focus on the effects strategies to respond to global warming have on existing socio-economic and eco-political planetary inequalities. By studying how planetary efforts for decarbonizing transport trigger different processes in resource-making, the project will not only enrich the anthropology of natural resources, but it will also create ground-breaking conceptual tools to support, think, and document emerging collaborations for sustainability capable of powering planetary eco-responsibility. Thus, the project will innovatively theorize new imaginaries to think about what counts as sustainable transitions in times of enhanced ecological sensitivity.",1500000.0,1500000.0,ERC-2019-STG,ERC-STG,UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM,NL,,,

Also in Europe, the number of plastic street containers for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) exceeds twenty million. The average lifetime of these articles ranges from five to ten years. When they break, these items are discarded and replaced with new ones. Discarded items have three destinations: recycling, incineration or as landfill. The owners of these plastic elements barely consider the possibility of their repair.
At Plastic Repair System, we have developed and patented an industrial technology for the repair of reusable plastic articles, which allows their use with total confidence and guarantees, while the cost of repair is less than one third of the new value of the same article. Repairs undertaken with PRS technology have been analysed by independent laboratories that have certified that PRS recovers 100% of the object's functionality and at least 98% of its original strength.

Thanks to advances in technology, Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics (BIPV) have emerged, enabling all buildings to become electricity producers and strive towards self-sustainability. 
Due to stringent energy efficiency norms in the EU, demand for BIPV products is soaring: PV incorporated in shells of multi-story buildings is required for supplying these high rise structures with energy. But also other artificial structures, e.g. sound barriers along highways, shall be used for energy provision, without further impact on the environment. Yet, truly integrated and aesthetic BIPV modules are currently neither available in commercial volumes nor at sustainable costs. Prices of products with still limited adaptability hinder the actual market growth. 
crystalsol addresses these shortcomings with a patented and entirely new type of cost-efficient, flexible and transparent PV technology where advantages of an efficient and stable monocrystalline absorber and low cost roll-to-roll (R2R) module production are combined. Due to the reason that crystalsol is able to produce semi-finished modules that allow full integration into building elements without any expensive and complex integration steps, BIPV products can pricewise finally compete with standard building shell elements (like facades without PV). This offers a huge competitive advantage, resulting in an enormous potential in the BIPV market. 
This Feasibility Study (cs-BIPV-FS) will bring crystalsol closer to the market entry stage. It will be a first step towards full commercialisation before upscaling the company’s operations and production processes.

The reduction of energy consumption in buildings is the focus of the European 2020 strategy. EU’s essential policy instruments that encourage energy efficiency, retrofit measures and renewable production are: the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD and EPBD recast) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). One of the major initiatives promoted by the EPBD recast is the implementation of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs) as the building objective from 2018 onwards. In the US, as well, several states’ strategic plans stipulate that all new residential buildings must be zero-net-energy (ZNE) by 2020, all new commercial buildings - by 2030, and 50% of existing commercial buildings must be retrofitted to ZNE by 2030. However currently available technologies pose challenges to reaching these objectives in cost-effective way. As an example, photovoltaic devices which bring high hopes and expectations to NZEBs, can currently only cover roofs, not allowing to optimally use the majority of building surface. They only generate energy from direct natural light and cannot be used on existing buildings without the need of severe structure modifications.

To split an exciton, these cells use a mixture of electron donor and acceptor materials. At present, most of the electron acceptors are made up of fullerenes or their derivatives. However, fullerenes exhibit only weak light absorption in the visible spectrum. Hence, practically half of the active material in the solar cell does not collect light and thus does not contribute to exciton and charge generation, thereby limiting the maximum efficiency of organic solar cells to 12%. 
Recent experimental and theoretical works show that it is possible to improve this low efficiency by replacing fullerene acceptors with small molecules (strong dyes). These strong dyes can change the energy profile of the donor-acceptor interface in a way that improves the solar cell behavior by causing it to favor more efficient charge-transferred state splitting. The mechanism by which the efficiency is improved is complex and not well-understood and is mediated by the strong dye’s ability to alter the electrostatic forces felt by generated excitons. However, a rational approach to design such non-fullerene acceptors on a molecular level, accounting for the complex electrostatic interactions, has not been developed.
In-depth molecular level understanding of donor-(non-fullerene) acceptor interfaces, including long-range electrostatic effects, is the first goal of this proposal. It will include simulations of morphologies and evaluation of electrostatic forces at donor-non-fullerene acceptor interfaces for several experimentally well-characterized systems. The second step will include the design of a pre-screening workflow for new acceptors, focusing on the optimization of the efficiency of the charge-transferred state splitting and minimization of the open circuit voltage losses.",174806.4,174806.4,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV,DE,,,

The network will be run as part of the Open Data Project giving maximum research impact through open access publications, data, software and public engagement. The research carried out through this network will go beyond the now ubiquitous process of creating computer based simulation models of structural dynamics.

The challenges are perhaps most obvious in the renewable energy sector, where technology is developing at a very rapid pace, and more reliable models are required to cope with structures subjected to extreme loadings which lead to a high degree of nonlinearity, and uncertainties. Applying our research to such problems will be accelerated by close interaction with the industrial partners in the network, with whom we intend to maintain and enhance an innovation focused relationship.

In particular, tower systems are appealing for the great environmental compatibility and offer tremendous potential for efficient (electrical and thermal) power generation. Yet, their industrial exploitation has been so far hindered by limitations in the materials used both for the central receiver - the core component - and for thermal storage. Such limitations dictate maximum working temperature and in-service overall durability (mainly driven by failure from thermal cycling and thermal shocks).  Improving the efficiency of a tower system entails necessarily improving the central receiver upstream and possibly re-engineering the whole systems downstream to work longer and at much higher temperature, especially in the thermal storage compartment.

These scientific discoveries can help address many of the grand challenges our society is facing, but unfortunately, too few of these new materials are implemented in real commercial devices. This is not because of a lack of interest or commercial potential, but often because there are no manufacturing methods available that allow for controlled processing of these materials at scale. 

This project aims to address this challenge by developing advanced nano and microstructures directly on a scalable Roll-to-Roll manufacturing platform, rather than considering manufacturing as an after-thought. This will be achieved by following a methodical approach, where material organisation is optimised from the bottom-up, starting with the nanoscale chemical material composition, followed by the microscale particle morphology, and finally their large area coating using Roll-to-Roll manufacturing. This hierarchical material build-up will be achieved by taking advantage of emerging scientific insights in robust self-assembly processes, combined with novel coating processes to allow for precise control over the particle flow and assembly on Roll-to-Roll. 

Our Roll-to-Roll process will be optimised to manufacture Li-Ion batteries with new form factors that allow the enhancement of their volumetric performance.

The objective of this project is to develop and test an innovative electricity market design that can meet society’s needs in a (near) 100% renewable power system. Such a long-term sustainable market design needs to provide efficient operational and investment incentives for an electricity system that is characterized by a high share of variable renewable energy sources, that is highly integrated with sectors such as home heating and cooling and transport, and needs to provide efficient incentives for the participation of all demand, from households to industrial consumers. It needs to provide security of supply by ensuring sufficient controllable electricity generation capacity without becoming too costly. And despite the variability of solar and wind energy the price risk must be limited: for investors, so the cost of capital does not become too high, and for consumers so they are not exposed to unmanageable swings in their energy expenses.

In this project, a market design will be developed that meets these objectives. It will be tested in a sophisticated simulation environment in which real-world characteristics such as actors’ limited foresight into the future and risk aversion are included. The performance of the market design - with respect to quantitative indicators such as security of supply, average costs to consumers and investment cost recovery - will be compared to a benchmark calculation of an optimal power system, which will also be developed in this project. We will involve representatives of all key stakeholder groups - consumers, large and small power generators, network operators and government in all phases of the process, in the market design as well as the development of the optimization and simulation models, in order to ensure the social acceptability of the research process and outcomes.",3988713.75,3988712.5,H2020-LC-SC3-2019-ES-SCC,RIA,Laboratorio Nacional de Energia e Geologia I.P.,PT,IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO;Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT Oy;ENBW ENERGIE BADEN-WURTTEMBERG AG;INSTITUTO SUPERIOR DE ENGENHARIA DO PORTO;SMARTWATT - ENERGY SERVICES SA;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;BITYOGA AS;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT,UK;NL;FI;DE;PT;NO,

Within this context, the capture of sunlight and its direct conversion to chemical fuels in artificial photosystems provides a promising route for sustainably meeting future energy demands. However, a central challenge is the lack of systems that can efficiently direct light excitations towards desired chemical products with high efficiency and stability under harsh reaction conditions. In recent years, advances in using thin films to protect chemically sensitive light absorbers have relaxed the requirement for intrinsically stable semiconductors and motivate an entirely new perspective for rational design of materials and interfaces. Within this context, SECANS aims to create the scientific basis for solar-to-chemical devices that achieve unprecedented combinations of efficiency and stability, enabled by targeted exploration and rational optimization of an underexplored class of materials – transition metal nitride semiconductors. The electronic structures of these materials can enable a favourable balance between large charge carrier mobility and high defect tolerance. However, due to the high stability of molecular nitrogen, the expansive range of possible nitrides is largely unexplored and their basic properties poorly understood. SECANS overcomes these challenges through an interdisciplinary approach that couples non-equilibrium semiconductor deposition and newly developed interface engineering methods, supported by advanced operando spectroscopies, to enable high efficiency light harvesting systems with self-healing interfaces. This project will develop novel nitride semiconductors optimized for solar-to-chemical energy conversion, elucidate the roles of defects and disorder on competitive kinetics within photochemical reaction cycles, and provide new insights into the science of photochemical stability.",1933750.0,1933750.0,ERC-2019-COG,ERC-COG,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET MUENCHEN,DE,,,

Key research activities are the development and optimization of top wide band gap perovskite and bottom low band gap CuInSe2 devices, suitable transparent conductive oxides, and integration into tandem configurations.

However, these structures also increase installation and maintenance costs, as well as structural risks. Wind damage is the main source of structural risk for trackers. It significantly shortens the lifespan of tracker arrays. Since PV plants need to resist over 20 years of service to be viable, the risk of systemic failures represents a considerable barrier for the growth of the tracker industry.

Over the last years, we have been developing a line of solar trackers, with great commercial success. We have introduced advanced features, positioning ourselves as a technological reference. These features include self-powered motors, a computerized backtracking system, an innovative installation procedure and a bifacial system to catch both direct and reflected sunlight, thus improving efficiency by 5%. We will now upgrade our latest prototype with a unique system, called SecureTracker, that will stabilize trackers to avoid wind-induced structural damage. 

SecureTracker will provide an outstanding solution against structural risks in large scale arrays, extending average lifetime in 10 years. It will reduce overall Levelized Cost of Energy by 30% for utility-scale solar arrays. At a lower cost than alternatives, SecureTracker will give us a decisive competitive advantage, allowing us to increase yearly installations by 300% by 2026, resulting in over €25 million of additional revenues and a ROI of 8.52.

In this context big investments are being done in the installation of charging points. These only use power from the grid, which presents three key drawbacks: capacity expansions in the power grid operator are needed, expected increasing power prices will make driving expensive and electric mobility will not be carbon free.  Meanwhile, solar photovoltaic has seen a great evolution in the past years where the price of panels has drastically decreased. This offers an opportunity to use solar energy for direct electric vehicle charging at low energy costs. However, solar carports have not been developed at industrial scale because it remains expensive due to engineering efforts to integrate the solar modules in the carport structure, labor to assemble and install the systems and the use of heavy materials like steel to support the structure. We have created e-port, the integrated EV solar carport made as a modular system that can be installed anywhere hence eliminating engineering efforts and allowing to industrialize its production, decreasing assembly cost (by 80%). Furthermore, we offer a plug and play system that drastically reduce installation time (from 10 days down to 1), reduces energy cost by 25% and at last, it is produced with carbon fibre and aluminium instead of heavy materials such as steal.

The most active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts to date are platinum group metals (PGM), mainly Pt and its alloys, deposited onto a carbon support. Pt is however costly and the catalysts degrade over time, due to aggregation of metal nanoparticles over the support. Also, no valuable contenders to Pt group metals have been identified for the alkaline HER. To address these issues, we propose to focus again on PGM based catalysts, but with solutions that reduce the amount of noble metal and that ensure catalyst stability by preventing aggregation. In our recently completed ERC project TRANS-NANO, we have prepared a highly active and stable HER catalyst, composed of a nanostructured Cu-Pt porous layer, directly grown onto a Ti current collector by in-situ slow electrodeposition of Pt. This catalyst delivers high hydrogen evolution current and outperforms the benchmark Pt/C in terms of activity at high overpotentials, and solves the most critical issue of Pt/C: its low long-term stability under operational conditions. Our catalyst can achieve the same performances of the Pt/C catalyst, but with a much lower Pt loading. For Ru, the process delivers a Cu-Ru/Ti catalyst with even better performance than the Cu-Pt/Ti system. In this POC project, we will upscale the production of Cu-Pt and Cu-Ru catalysts, starting from large area Ti substrates. Their HER activity will be tested under industrially relevant conditions. Such electrode architecture will enable the fabrication of high-performance alkaline water electrolysers for large-scale applications.

massively deployed, and particularly in time critical mission, the handling and charging of many battery packs becomes a
logistical problem. Thus, manned aerial platforms (helicopters and planes) or large (>25 kg) fixed-wing UAV systems,
powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) have been the preferred option for long endurance missions such as
monitoring and surveying. However, these large systems present high CAPEX and OPEX, mostly due to the oversized

What is the actual trigger for the dynamic response of a rock when precipitation occurs, and can we ultimately control this trigger? The answer lies at the meso-scale, i.e. the scale of the pore network, where precipitation-dissolution reactions, geometry changes and flow and transport properties changes meet. These reactions and changes are strongly coupled, but their respective importance for the resulting rock dynamics is unclear.

The proposal puts forward an utterly original idea that leads to a novel paradigm for vehicular traffic in the era of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and is based on two combined principles.

The first principle is lane-free traffic, which renders the driving task for CAVs smoother and safer, as risky lane-changing manoeuvres become obsolete; increases the static and dynamic capacity of the roadway due to increased road occupancy; and mitigates congestion-triggering manoeuvres. The second principle is the nudge effect, whereby vehicles may be 'pushing' (from a distance, using sensors or communication) other vehicles in front of them; this allows for traffic flow to be freed from the anisotropy restriction, which stems from the fact that human driving is influenced only by downstream vehicles. The nudge effect may be implemented in various possible ways, so as to maximize the traffic flow efficiency, subject to safety and convenience constraints.

TrafficFluid combines lane-free traffic with vehicle nudging to provide, for the first time since the automobile invention, the possibility to design (rather than merely describe or model) the traffic flow characteristics in an optimal way, i.e. to engineer the future CAV traffic flow as an efficient artificial fluid. To this end, the project will develop and deliver the necessary vehicle movement strategies for various motorway and urban road infrastructures, along with microscopic and macroscopic simulators and traffic management actions.

TrafficFluid risk stems from the immense challenge of designing a new traffic system from scratch; however, we expect that the project will trigger a whole new path of international innovative research developments and testbeds that would pave the way towards a new efficient traffic system in the era of CAVs.

This Calcium-looping process (CaL) is the basis of a proven pilot-scale technology for CO2 capture, which is accomplished by carbonation of CaO and its regeneration in a calciner reactor operated under high CO2 partial pressure and high temperature. The wide availability of limestone (<10€/ton) is a key factor for the feasibility of the CaL process. However, the huge potential for lime also to store energy has been inhibited by its propensity to sinter at the high temperatures of the standard CaL cycle for CO2 capture, which reduces dramatically its multicycle conversion. SOCRATCES will be built on previous R&D results of the partners indicating that the CaL process can be integrated into CSP plants for thermochemical energy storage and power generation by means of a simple closed CO2 loop.

This is largely because a future of rapidly decarbonized electricity supply is imagined, in which using electricity via heat pumps is one of the lowest carbon emission heating options
To address the problem ECOinstal, a company with 16 years of consolidated know-how on the Romanian market and provider of solutions for the Swiss, German, Austrian and Hungarian market takes a different approach in comparison with the existing solutions and developed the new type of the Heat Pump - ECOPUMP. ECOPUMP is a first solution on the market which operates on the Propane R290 refrigerant and which provides up to 5.4 CoP (Coefficient of Performance). Moreover, the heat pump is a ready to use solution, which can be installed in up two working days and do not require any intervention at home level or some specific changes in spatial planning of the court.
ECOPUMP is now in stage TRL 7 and it needs to take a few more steps in order to finalize the solution so that it could be put on the EU and global market. The ECOPUMP direct expansion Heat Pump will undergo further development in order to obtain European wide certification for Energy Label and Home Appliances Safety standards without restrictions for market readiness. ECOPUMP now is working on the documentation for patent application for ground to water direct expansion Heat Pump with 'eco-friendly' propane R 290 refrigerant, which will be submitted after they obtain the energy label certification. 
For the initial introduction, only building administrators within the EU will be targeted, Germany, France and Italy being most relevant European markets for ECOPUMP, with further entry to the US and Canadian market.

responds to the end-users´ demands (reduce amortisation period of the investment to acquire EV/HEV and cut down on
maintenance costs while increasing their lifespan). Current solutions in the market either replace the whole battery when
only a few cells are not operating or repair the battery with limited energy storage capacity cells. BATT3RY ground-breaking
proposition consists of extending the life of the batteries of EV/HEV by repairing them with our own designed method and
cells support modules; reusing those cells that are not suitable for automotive use any longer by giving them a second life as
part of batteries for domestic use; recycling the elements and materials of those which are unusable with our fully efficient
separation method.
BATT3RY will disrupt in the market allowing EV/HEV owners to save up to 18,000€ in maintenance of their vehicles life while
extending their operative life. BATT3RY will directly contribute to the development of a greater sustainable mobility by

When the policies are fully implemented, they will lead to a great reduction on emissions for the whole EU, around 45% by 2030 (relative to 1990 GHG emission). The EU framework towards GHG emissions reduction is based in six key areas of action, including the deployment of renewable energy production, decarbonising heating and cooling applications (which vastly relies on fossil fuels), and reducing the emissions on the transport sector. Therefore, the integrated energy markets in the EU shall allow important transformations to provide more flexibility and be better placed to integrate a greater share of renewable energies, allowing also a more independent energy system. 
In this context, Hydrogen can play a pivotal role as energy vector allowing coupling the energy sectors (produced by electrolysis) , and as an alternative fuel in hard to electrify sectors. To facilitate that a high amount of hydrogen is produced by RE, existent gas infrastructure could be a way of transporting hydrogen between production point and final use. Therefore, hydrogen injection into the gas grid could support gas-electricity sector coupling and opening the role of hydrogen as a way of decarbonising the gas usages.
HIGGS project aims to pave the way to decarbonisation of the gas grid and its usage, by covering the gaps of knowledge of the impact that high levels of hydrogen could have on the gas infrastructure, its components and its management. 
To reach this goal, several activities, including mapping of technical, legal and regulatory barriers and enablers, testing and validation of systems and innovation, techno-economic modelling and the preparation of a set of conclusions as a pathway towards enabling the injection of hydrogen in high-pressure gas grids, are developed in the project.",2107672.5,2107672.5,H2020-JTI-FCH-2019-1,FCH2-RIA,FUNDACION PARA EL DESARROLLO DE LAS NUEVAS TECNOLOGIAS DEL HIDROGENO EN ARAGON,ES,REDEXIS GAS SA;HSR HOCHSCHULE FUR TECHNIK RAPPERSWIL;FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION;EUROPEAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GAS AND ENERGY INNOVATION;DVGW DEUTSCHER VEREIN DES GAS- UND WASSERFACHES - TECHNISCH-WISSENSCHAFTLICHER VEREIN EV,ES;CH;BE;DE,

For example, countries including China, the UK, Germany, India and France intend to ban new internal combustion vehicles within ~20 years. Battery powered electric vehicles have an important role to play, but they continue to be limited by range and charging time, so there is increasing interest in alternatives such as hydrogen fuel cells. It is predicted that by 2032, over 22 million fuel cells will be in operation. 

Fuel cells consume stored hydrogen and oxygen (from air) to produce electricity. Heat and water are the only by-products, so the technology is non-polluting at the point of use. However, fuel cells are still relatively expensive and a key way to reduce their cost is to supply air at higher pressure, using a compressor. This increases power output, allowing them to be made smaller and cheaper, but compressors can consume up to 40% of the energy produced by the fuel cell, so their efficiency is critical. 

Aeristech’s compressors operate much more efficiently, requiring 10-20% less power than competitive products. They are also up to 20% smaller and will operate continuously at high power for 4,000 hours without servicing.  These unique advantages are creating enormous commercial interest.

Our solution, FC-eCompressor, has been developed to prototype stage (TRL6) and we now need to optimise the technology for production and gain approvals for commercial supply. To achieve this, we must produce sample units that are manufactured using high-volume production techniques, but this is expensive and time-consuming.

The system efficiency over 50% (DC, LHV) is achieved with novel ideas of thermal integration with a two-stage reformer setup and by using thermoelectric generators (TEG), utilising the high temperature heat of HTPEMFC stack.

An aqueous phase reformer (APR) for methanol pre-reforming is applied for the first time in a commercial scale HTPEMFC system. The use of APR and its thermal integration in the FC system enables efficient utilisation of the stack waste heat and enables reformer efficiency approaching 95%. The best available catalysts will be screened and adapted for the reformer, both for the APR and for the 2nd stage reformer, which employs commercialised reformer technology from project partner Catator and recently developed methanol-reforming catalyst from partner University of Porto.

The system efficiency is further improved by increasing the fuel utilization to above 95% in the HTPEMFC stack. This is enabled by improving anode gas flow distribution in the cells as well as improving the stack end plates. The new end plate design will also enable stack pressurising and improving stack efficiency over 55 %. 

The improvements in the HTPEM system design for mini-CHP use are validated in relevant environment, coupled to the heating and power system of a detached house, so that reliable data of the operation and stability can be generated.

It is at the heart of many physical phenomena, such as the creation of electron-hole pairs in the photovoltaic effect or the fast migration of electronic charge within a molecule. In order to study coherent electron dynamics, extremely high spatial and temporal resolving power is required, which is highly challenging. Well-established imaging methods like scanning tunneling microscopy achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution, while lacking ultrafast time resolution. At the temporal frontier, I recently bridged the gap between attosecond spectroscopy (1as = 10-18 s) and the nano-scale. The goal of my research program is to unlock the full potential of attosecond spectroscopy by achieving simultaneous spatial and temporal probing of ultrafast coherent phenomena.

The proposed approach relies on the introduction of attosecond spectroscopy into scanning tunneling microscopy and electron holography. The spatial resolution of these methods is based on nano-scale needle tips, serving as local probes or as point-like electron sources. My team and I will develop attosecond temporal gates at the tips, enabling pump-probe spectroscopy. The resulting “pump” – triggering the coherent dynamics – and the “probe” – measuring its evolution – are localized in space and time, with attosecond and sub-nanometer precision.

Batteries will be key enablers but require major progress. Battery materials that promise a step-change in energy density compared with current Li-ion batteries rely on fundamentally different reactions to store charge, e.g. Si alloying or O2 reduction instead of intercalation. They have in common high volume changes on cycling and poor conductivity. For the active component of a battery electrode to function it must be simultaneously in contact with ionic and electronic pathways to electrolyte and current collector. State-of-the-art conducting additives and binders in the composite electrodes cannot ensure ideal contact for such materials and fail to exploit their full potential.

In this project I directly target these fundamental challenges of high-energy batteries by replacing now used conducting additives and binders with flexible organic mixed ion and electron conductors that follow volume changes to ensure at any stage intimate contact with ions and electrons. This requires progress with the fundamental science of such conductors, for which to achieve we develop and combine synthetic, electroanalytic and spectroscopic methods, aided by theory. Mixed conducting polymer gels, designed for the particular storage material, shall be elaborated for two ultra-high capacity electrodes, the O2 cathode and the Si anode.

The significant advantage, next to intimate contact, is that the packing density of active material can be maximized. This boosts energy stored by total electrode mass and volume by rigorously cutting the amount of non-active materials compared with current approaches. The expected overriding scientific impact includes improved understanding of mixed conductors concerning synthesis, structure, conductivity and their behaviour in the complex battery environment. This opens up new perspectives for the realm of high-capacity battery materials that demand such a breakthrough to succeed.",1494253.75,1494253.75,ERC-2014-STG,ERC-STG,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET GRAZ,AT,,,

It will analyse planning and construction processes to identify possible cost reductions. An investigation of end-users' experiences and expectations together with a guide on co-benefits of NZEBs will promote living in these buildings and enhance the energy performance by conducive user behaviour. 
The technology solution sets will include approaches that can reduce costs for installations or generation systems, pre-fabrication and construction acceleration, local low temperature district heating including RES, and many more. Examples are pure electrical heating in combination with PV, PV/T in conjunction with a heat pump so that no earth coupling is required, ventilation supply through the walls to reduce the costs for ducts, larger bricks including insulation, decentral domestic hot water generation (fresh-water stations), etc. All solution sets will be assessed regarding cost savings, energy performance and applicability in multi-family houses. A life cycle assessment of different building levels and NZEBs using the solution sets will provide a longer term perspective.

It also has a pathogenic role as a generator of reactive oxygen species and possibly through chemiexcitation, and its polydopamine synthetic analogue has raised great interest in the materials community. In spite of these multiple points of interest, the details of melanin structure and its main photoprotecting function are still largely unknown, mostly due to the heterogeneous polymer structure. Closing this gap is an urgent challenge, and our proposal aims at doing that with the methods of computational chemistry. Based on the widely accepted hierarchical structure model for melanin, in WP1 we will generate a library of aggregates made of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) oligomers with different connectivity and redox state (diol, semiquinone and quinone forms). In WP2 we will simulate the absorption spectra of the aggregates and compare them with the experimental melanin spectrum, which starts at the near IR and increases monotonically into the UV. In WP3 we will simulate the excited-state decay mechanisms for the different aggregates in order to explain melanin's lack of fluorescence, which is indicative of fast decay responsible for its photoprotecting function. The results of our project will provide a new view on the photoprotecting function of melanin based on a systematic consideration of its heterogeneous structure, and they will allow us to assess what specific aggregates are responsible for the different functional characteristics. They will help us to assess the possible pathogenic role of melanin chemiexcitation, and provide new principles for design of PDA-based functional materials.",172932.48,172932.48,H2020-MSCA-IF-2018,MSCA-IF-EF-ST,UNIVERSITAT DE GIRONA,ES,,,

My vision is that this connection will eventually evolve into the organizing principle of computational complexity and will lead to solutions of fundamental problems such as the Unique Games Conjecture or even the P-versus-NP problem.  In order to break through the current limits of this algebraic approach, I will concentrate on specific goals designed to

(A) discover suitable objects capturing symmetry that reflect the complexity in problem classes, where such an object is not known yet;

(B) make the natural ordering of symmetries coarser so that it reflects the complexity more faithfully;

(C) delineate the borderline between computationally hard and easy problems;

(D) strengthen characterizations of existing borderlines to increase their usefulness as tools for proving hardness and designing efficient algorithm; and

(E) design efficient algorithms based on direct and indirect uses of symmetries.

The specific goals concern the fixed-language CSP over finite relational structures and its generalizations to infinite domains (iCSP) and weighted relations (vCSP), in which the algebraic theory is highly developed and the limitations are clearly visible. 

The approach is based on joining the forces of the universal algebraic methods in finite domains, model-theoretical and topological methods in the iCSP, and analytical and probabilistic methods in the vCSP.

The system has been conceived in a holistic approach to the overall substructure, tower and turbine, generating ground breaking synergies between the integrated elements to specifically address the particular requirements of offshore wind, focusing in the capacity for low-cost industrialization in the inshore construction and offshore installation processes. 

The Telwind concept integrates a novel floating substructure and a pioneer self-erecting telescopic tower. The former provides all the performance advantages of a spar-buoy substructure while allowing for qualitatively lower material usage, the latter enables a full onshore preassembly of the overall system and a highly beneficial reduction of offshore works and auxiliary means.

Hacking is the primary causes of data breaches, and today’s existing solutions are simply not sufficient to meet the threat.

The objective of Dyadic Security is to provide high security to organizations, and to protect digital assets, even in the event of a network breach. Dyadic’s Distributed Security Module (DSM) is a unique software-only offering that provides the highest level of security while being affordable and easy to deploy. At the core of the DSM lies cutting-edge technology based on decades of cryptographic research on secure multiparty computation (MPC). Dyadic’s DSM solves the inherent single point of failure in all of today’s security systems. Strong cryptographic solutions exist for protecting data, securing web traffic, authenticating users, and so on. However, they all rely on the secret key and authentication credentials (e.g., passwords) remaining secret. In today’s reality where hackers get past firewalls and penetrate deep into networks, these keys and credentials are stolen thereby rendering all cryptographic protection useless. Dyadic’s DSM randomly splits keys and credentials across servers so that they are never in any single place to be stolen. The advanced protocols used in the DSM ensure that even if some of the servers are breached and completely controlled by an attacker, the secrets and credentials cannot be stolen. The result is that digital assets remain safe, even when all else has failed and attackers are inside the network.

Access to such a Test Bed will help establish the industrial eco-systems, R&D investments and new supply chains to support market entry as well as providing a global competitive advantage, leading to growth and job creation.  
For Europe to be more competitive compared to the US and Asia, digitalisation of both the development and manufacturing of functional nanomaterials and printed components needs to be established, as well as addressing cost, productivity and capacity. The digitalisation of the European production industry (industry 4.0) through digital based production technologies, such as ink-jet printing, additive manufacturing, robotically assisted in-mould labelling, laser processing, stereo lithography, etc., requires functional nanomaterials and formulations and is a major bottleneck due to high prices and limited volume production. 
LEE-BED will address these challenges by building European infrastructure for rapid development and pilot production of nanomaterial, inks, adhesives and composites as well as digital based pilot production lines. LEE-BED will unify the entire value chain from raw materials to embedded electrical components, providing tailored solutions for European entrepreneurs, start-ups, SMEs and large enterprises, with the main objective of going from concept to prototype within six months. Unique to LEE-BED will be the development of tailored services, including technical, business, patent mapping, safety and life-cycle analysis modelling. LEE-BED will also provide funding services for LEE-BED access to SMEs and post-project capital. LEE-BED will guide European industry towards sustainable implementation of innovative technologies, making them stronger and more globally competitive.",11463716.25,10696766.25,H2020-NMBP-HUBS-2018,IA,TEKNOLOGISK INSTITUT,DK,"INSTITUTO TECNOLOGICO DEL EMBALAJE, TRANSPORTE Y LOGISTICA;GRAFIETIC SL;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO;CENTRE FOR PROCESS INNOVATION LIMITED LBG;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES;D.
