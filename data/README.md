## Conditions 

Following the FAIR principles of research data management, the following datasets in this enclosed folder ("the Datasets") are described and classified by their provenance nature.

**1) Raw Data:** Datasets that are precisely in their original state which were downloaded  

- `cordis-h2020projects.xlsx`  

**2) Complementary Data:** These datasets are catalogues or lookup tables. Complementary data does not come from the source and does not form part of the results of the articles. Rather aid the results  

- `mitigation-technology-catalogue.xls`
- `sample_tagged.xls`
- `table_priorities.xlsx`
- `tech_example.xls`

**3) Derived Data:** These datasets are the table results after data processing methodologies. Datasets are outputs of the modelling process

- `cordis-h2020projects-filtered-by-CleanTechTag-Final.xls`
- `not_invested_technologies.xlsx`
- `cleantechtag_deterministic_results.csv`
- `cleantechtag_joint_results.csv`
- `cleantechtag_probabilistic_results.csv`
- `not_invested_technologies.csv`
- `sample_to_tag.csv`

The Datasets are in machine-readable formats. Their Open Access nature makes them free of charge, subject to the terms of this agreement (these “Dataset Terms”), and subject to the general Terms and Conditions for using the original [Copyright notice
of the Publications Office of the European Union (OP Portal)](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/about-us/legal-notices/publications-office-of-the-european-union-copyright). Where these Dataset Terms conflict with the General Terms and Conditions, these Dataset Terms shall prevail. The use of data derived from the Datasets, which may appear in formats such as tables and charts, is also subject to these Dataset Terms.
