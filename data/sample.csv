16,MOnitoring VEgetation status and functioning at high spatio-temporal resolution from Sentinel-2,"Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of green Vegetation Cover (FCOVER) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) are key biophysical variables representing the status and functioning of vegetation. High spatiotemporal resolution LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER products are urgently needed in many terrestrial applications including crop and forest management. However, the trade-off in traditional remote sensing sensors between temporal and spatial resolutions hinders the generation of such products. The launch of Sentinel-2 satellites, with spatial resolution of 10-20 m and 5-day temporal sampling (in tandem), opens a new paradigm in satellite vegetation monitoring. The proposed project â€œMOVESâ€ will develop an operational algorithm for retrieving LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER from Sentinel-2 data. An easily-invertible radiative transfer model (RTM) will be firstly developed, which will apply a universal model framework for all vegetation types (continuous vs discrete) and terrains (horizontal vs sloping). In this project, the hybrid training and domain adaption paradigms will be introduced into the retrieval of LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER, to enhance the transferability of the retrieval algorithm and achieve spatiotemporally consistent retrieval. The Copernicus ground-based observations (GBOC) and FLUXNET sites will be used to validate the proposed algorithm and assess its potential in the monitoring of vegetation status and functioning. The project is conceived to combine the prominent expertise of the hosting institute in biophysical variable retrieval and remote sensing ecological application, with my well-demonstrated RTM development skills. Overall, MOVES will facilitate the delivery of Sentinel-2 LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER products of physical consistence and high accuracy, and underpin new avenues for the development of high spatiotemporal frequency vegetation monitoring systems.",CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION ECOLOGICA Y APLICACIONES FORESTALES
33,The first non-fermentative production process for low cost synthesis of biodegradable PHAs bioplastic from vegetal oils and fats,"POLÃ¬PO S.r.l. has developed the first chemical route (not based on bacterial fermentation) to produce PHA from vegetal oils and fats. PHA is the only bioplastic which is 100% degradable in natural environment but is presently only applied in niche applications due the high costs of production. POLÃ¬PO's chemical route to PHA represents a game changing technology in the field of bioplastic, making it possible to produce a biodegradable bioplastic with key advantages with respect to current fermentative route: reduction of production cost > 35 %; reduction of investment for production plant of around 70-80%; reduction of plant size of around 50%; use of non-food raw materials.
The unique selling point is then to enable production of 100% biodegradable PHAs from different non-food oil sources in a competitive manner for large scale applications (e.g. food packaging) which are presently not allowed by the high price of PHAs. This will allow as first step to substitute bio-based PET in this segment, worth 800 kt/year in 2016, and successively targeting substitution of fossil based plastics. 
After validation at pre-industrial scale, POLÃ¬POâ€™s process will be licensed to existing and new industrial players in the bioplastic manufacturing sector, in the form of License Agreement or Joint Venture. In the feasibility study POLÃ¬PO needs to 1) carry out Customer Validation for the technology, 2) Define the industrial upstream and downstream value chain and profiling industrial partners and investors 3) Refine the Business Plan the Business Model and the Investment strategy.",POLIPO SRL
43,"Final development, clinical validation and launch preparation of NL01, an innovative health ingredient for supplements, food products and foods for special medical purposes","People want to live a long and healthy life and there is a huge demand for food products to enable this. Among consumers, the most desired health benefits in food products and supplements are â€˜supports immune functionâ€™ and â€˜increases resistance to infectionsâ€™.

NutriLeads is a dynamic Health Ingredients company developing crop-derived food ingredients with clinically proven health benefits. With its proprietary lead ingredient NL01, having completed preclinical data and proven safety in humans, NutriLeads is on track to become the first company to launch an ingredient with an approved health claim for supporting immune function and increasing infection resistance.

446,"A hydraulic collection tower, with a novel energy storage device for wave energy arrays","Wave energy convertors (WEC) capture the energy contained in ocean waves and use it to generate electricity. The use of wave energy provides the opportunity to generate energy at a wide range of locations throughout Europe, which will strengthen the stability of Europeâ€™s energy networks. WEC developers have still not achieved a lower cost of energy through a viable and competitive technology.  Ocean Harvesting Technologies AB (OHT) was founded in 2007 and develops an innovative and patented hydraulic collection system and storage technology for wave energy arrays. The power captured by wave energy converters (WEC) is pumped in the form of pressurized fluid through a piping system to a central tower, where the collected power is first smoothed by the novel OH energy storage device and then converted into electricity. OHTs vision is that their technology will solve the problems with current centralized hydraulic collection systems through a more efficient solution and ultimately lead to lower cost of energy. Besides generating efficient and even power, the simplicity of the OH design will allow better protection in rough conditions, and make its manufacture impressively cost-efficient. OHTs energy storage technology will not only remove the intermittent nature of wave energy but turn wave farms into flexible power plants.

598,"Carbon 2 Butanol, a breakthrough technology in eco-innovation that cuts GHG emissions by converting industrial waste gases into chemicals and biofuel.","C2B is a novel microbially-mediated process that captures large amounts of CO2 from industrial plants and converts it into biofuels and chemicals. C2B process is based on Oakbioâ€™s proprietary microbial strain, which uses CO2 from any flue gas and hydrogen (H2) as a feedstock to produce n-butanol, a valuable drop-in biofuel. In fact, n-butanol is primarily used to make durable acrylic plastics, but is also a superior biofuel, which addresses a massive market as a potential gasoline replacement. Oakbioâ€™s microbial strain grows in a standard fermenter that can be located next to the flue stack of the factories (cement plants, power plants and refineries). It can capture flue gas directly at the point source with minimal retrofitting. This will allow such factories to cut 70% of their direct GHG emissions, while the n-butanol production adds a significant revenue stream to their bottom line: Oakbio estimates a return of more than â‚¬25 per t/CO2 captured.",OAKBIO LTD
604,Second Life Batteries for Domestic Electricity Storage,"Powervault aims to be the EUâ€™s specialist provider of cost-effective distributed electricity storage for domestic homes, lowering electricity bills and allowing residents to seize the opportunities of the smart power revolution. 

The EU's electricity networks face considerable challenges from decarbonisation - with microgeneration, electric vehicle penetration and renewable heat stressing local distribution networks which were not designed to take this load. New technologies offering flexibility,such as energy storage, offer a potential solution. However, despite benefits for consumers, electricity network operators and wider society, small scale electricity storage remains prohibitively expensive with high upfront unit costs inhibiting mass market uptake. 

With SLB-DES Powervault has devised a multi-faceted solution that explicitly tackles the high upfront cost of domestic electricity storage. Here Powervault has instigated technical innovation and commercial sophistication, recycling second life electric vehicle batteries on a storage as a service basis.  SLB-DES is explicitly designed to be the most affordable and resource efficient electricity storage solution globally. 
 
Powervault believes the cost-effective SLB-DES proposition can radically accelerate domestic electricity storage uptake, allowing more customers to benefit from increased usage of renewables and seize the opportunities of the smart power revolution, thereby supporting EU ambitions of an efficient and clean energy system. 

Powervault will use this feasibility study to evaluate the European market opportunity for SLB-DES, identify the steps necessary for mass market commercialisation and prepare for a Phase 2 pilot trial.",POWERVAULT LTD
969,Improving the productivity of Biodiesel plants through their adaptation for the production of polyols,"B-Ecolyol is BETA's innovative solution to overcome periods of inactivity in biodiesel plants due to market fluctiations in raw materials' pricing, which make production unprofitable.
Our experience in the bio-refinery sector, and in the development of engineering processes for the valorization of used oil enabled us to see that our biodiesel plants could also be used for the production of polyols .These are products with a great market potential as they are used for the production of polyurethane for a vast variety of applications- from coatings and adhesives, to automotive seats or fibres.
Thus, our solution consists on a simple processing technology that can be adapted within biodiesel plants, for the production of eco-polyols from used oil or biodiesel, increasing their productivity while valorizing a product usually considered as residue (used oil). In this way, we eliminate the issue of limited availability of resources and their associated pricing fluctuations. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity and mild operating conditions of our process, we will reduce global warming emissions and use of non-renewable energy by 36% and 61%, respectively compared to petroleum derived polyols.
Our business model at BETA Group has a double approach, 1) as producers of biodiesel and derived added value products such as eco-polyols and 2) as providers of engineering services. The exploitation of the B-Ecolyol project will follow this double strategy, on one hand increasing our bio-polyol production for its commercialization, and on the other, providing our engineering services for the implementation of the licensed technology in other companies with the same productivity issues. In this way, the B-Ecolyols project will not only have a remarkable economic impact on our company (increasing our revenues by 49% by 2023, with a ROI of 3.33), but will also contribute to increase our competitiveness , by targeting new markets and increasing our international presence",BETA RENOWABLE GROUP SA
1082,Titanium Oxide Nanocomposites for Scalable Optimized Perovskite Solar cells,"The European commission recognizes the importance of nanotechnology, semiconductors and advanced materials as key enabling technologies. The application of functional nanostructured materials in industrial processes and advanced science is of capital and strategic importance for the European economy and society. Their inclusion as reliable, standard and affordable components will boost the competitiveness of European industry, specifically in the fabrication of 4th generation solar cells. Sensitized Perovskites Solar cells (PSC) represent advantages in terms of cost manufacturing, energy generation and integration in flexible and semitransparent devices. However, the viability of their mass scale fabrication is hindered by economic and technical difficulties. Some of these technical issues arise from inefficient infiltration of the perovskite absorber into a fragile mesoporous (mp) TiO2 layer. My project addresses these problems applying a recently developed straightforward method for secure TiO2 nanotube layers (TNL) to commodity thermoplastic polymers. This novel method combined with optimized solution synthesized perovskites will result in the production of flexible and pliable PSC. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the standardization and fabrication of functional nanostructured materials, and its implementation in optimized PSCs. Lastly, the study on the life cycle management and viability of the industrial production of these PSC will be evaluated in an innovative photovoltaic manufacture company, ONYX SOLAR. Hence, the project is designed to generate disruptive, but easily scalable technology that may be rapidly adopted by European industry to boost its competitiveness in functional nanostructured composites and 4th generation solar cells.",AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DEINVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS

1458,Sustainable production of next generation biofuels from waste streams,"WASTE2FUELS aims to develop next generation biofuel technologies capable of converting agrofood waste (AFW) streams into high quality biobutanol.

Butanol is one of the most promising biofuels due to its superior fuel properties compared to current main biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel. In addition to its ability to reduce carbon emissions, its higher energy content (almost 30% more than ethanol), its ability to blend with both gasoline and diesel, its lower risk of separation and corrosion, its resistance to water absorption, allowing it to be transported in pipes and carriers used by gasoline, it offers a very exciting advantage for adoption as engines require almost no modifications to use it.  

The main WASTE2FUELS innovations include:

â€¢    Development of novel pretreatment methods for converting AFW to an appropriate feedstock for biobutanol production thus dramatically enlarging current available biomass for biofuels production
â€¢    Genetically modified microorganisms for enhancing conversion efficiencies of the biobutanol fermentation process
â€¢    Coupled recovery and biofilm reactor systems for enhancing conversion efficiencies of Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation
â€¢    Development of new routes for biobutanol production via ethanol catalytic conversion
â€¢    Biobutanol engine tests and ecotoxicological assessment of the produced biobutanol
â€¢    Valorisation of the process by-products 
â€¢    Development of an integrated model to optimise the waste-to-biofuel conversion and facilitate the industrial scale-up
â€¢    Process fingerprint analysis by environmental and techno-economic assessment
â€¢    Biomass supply chain study and design of a waste management strategy for rural development

By valorising 50% of the unavoidable and undervalorised AFW as feedstock for biobutanol production, WASTE2FUELS could divert up to 45 M tonnes of food waste from EU landfills, preventing 18 M tonnes of GHG and saving almost 0.5 billion litres of fossil fuels.","IRIS TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, SOCIEDAD LIMITADA"

1940,Rapid tree-planting through the use of remote sensing and unmanned vehicle planting technologies for large scale reforestation,"Currently used methods for reforestation and tree-planting such as hand planting and direct seeding  are time-consuming and expensive. As a result tree-planting has been unable to keep up with number of trees lost each year. Right now we are facing a net global loss of 6.6 billion trees each year. 
The EU is currently seeking out solutions to facilitate the sustainable supply of materials for the future and BioCarbon Engineering have developed a planting system to enable industrial scale reforestation protecting and regenerating forest resources. The planting system developed by BioCarbon Engineering consists of a mapping unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a planting UAV and machine learning software. It is a massive improvement on current reforesting techniques being a fully automated process and it will simultaneously enable cheaper and faster tree planting (10 seeds planted per UAV per minute). Given that the planting is being carried out by an aerial vehicle, it is possible to plant in terrain that is inaccessible by land-based approaches. It therefore offers a higher return on investment since it can carry out the same activity at a lower cost while also having a greater reach for tree planting.
The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with the automated planting solution being demonstrated out in different ecosystems throughout Europe, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.",BIOCARBON ENGINEERING LTD

In the last years non-conventional gas sources have been developed. It is necessary to bet for new sources which are sustainable, as those based in biomass. The announcement made by the G7 Group at the Summit of June 2015 of phasing out fossil fuels by the end of the century is aligned with the European frameworks for 2020, 2030 and 2050. 
Also, waste management is an important issue, since around 485 kgs of waste are generated yearly per person in the EU, and Landfill and Waste Framework Directives have defined the reduction of landfilled waste. 
OSPRE Ltd is an SME from UK, composed of staff highly qualified in finance, chemistry and engineering. OSPRE is building a pilot plant in the UK based in a new EnergyFromWaste technology to transform municipal and commercial&industrial waste into a gas rich in methane (50-60%), which will be partly used for electricity generation. With this project OSPRE will complement the capabilities by developing Upgrade and Compression stages in order to generate Compressed Biomethane for vehicles engines. The technology, based in pyrolysis, processes 2.5 tonnes of waste per hour into 430 Nm3 of methane at a single 24 m2 module, (up to 4 times faster than Gasification and Anaerobic Digestion, which need thousands of m2). The Compressed Biomethane will be used as a fuel for the transport sector. Using waste as feedstock and generating gas at such a high rate make viable to propose Circular Economy business models, processing municipal waste of a given town and powering its public services vehicles with gas. 
OSPRE will commercialize this innovation. P-DRIVE will add a high value by allowing plants to be used for gas generation or mixed use, in addition to electricity.

2569,Sewage sludge reuse  Phosphate recovery with an innovative HTC technology (HTCycle),"Efficient municipal wastewater treatment produces vast amounts of sewage sludge. The latest data show a yearly production of 9.637 thousands of tons in Europe. Sludge treatment issues are often neglected in comparison with water-related parameters which results in serious technical difficulties and highly expensive disposal methods. An energy efficient, environmentally sound and economically viable process for sludge disposal and reuse of valuable resources e.g. phosphorus hardly exists.
The most common disposal methods for sludge are spreading on agricultural soil, composting and incineration. Landfilling has been long banned, the use as fertilizer, although very moderate in costs, is being banned in many regions due to concerns about contamination of soils with heavy metals and endocrine disruptive compounds. Incineration entails the highest costs (80-110 â‚¬ /ton), but is also considered the safest disposal method and is fast growing and widely adopted. It presents also technical difficulties, such as the low overall efficiency of the process, the huge logistic efforts required to transport the sludge to the incineration plants, or the disposal of the ashes after the sludge has been incinerated.
In this situation, the proposing company, AVA-CO2 has the objective to demonstrate and commercialize their proprietary technology for hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to the conditions of sewage sludge, showing clearly technical and economic advantages against the current sludge incineration method. AVA-CO2 aims to increase the amount of sludge converted into high value products such as fuel, activated carbons for water treatment, recovered phosphorus, soil remediation material, carbon sequestration schemes and other applications. The HTCycle process turns the present sewage sludge disposal (incineration) from a costly process into an income-generating activity",HTCycle GMBH

2907,Transparent Solar Panel Technology for Energy Autonomous Greenhouses and Glass Buildings,"According to United Nations estimations, the world population will reach to 9,7 billion by 2050.  Food, energy and water are the three critical resources that must be managed if mankind is going to thrive. With these figures, we will need a 70-100% increase of food supply to maintain the current nutrition levels. Greenhouse farming is a solution to the food worldwide demands as it can increase the food production per acre up to 100% compared to open field agriculture. Although the energy consumption by agriculture made up only 2.8 % of final energy consumption in the EU-281, the global leader in greenhouse production of horticultural products, The Netherlands, has the highest energy consumption in Europe (7.2 %), clearly showing the impact of Greenhouse farming on energy sources. 
On top of that, the world to which we are currently heading also deserves energetic sustainable solutions to satisfy the growing rate of electrification in the extended populated areas. The global primary energy demand could increase by 50% by the middle of the century. Nowadays, buildings account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption globally but it is estimated that potential energy savings in buildings could reach between 20% and 40% with new solutions. Solar panels enable energy savings; typically installed on the roof, they do not offer versatility for other type of application, such as windows to allow the entrance of the light inside buildings or greenhouses.
Our solution, PanePowerSW is the unique transparent (up to 70%) solar panel glass that generates clean energy through PV technology and more importantly allows the light to shine through greenhouses and commercial buildings windows. Completely aligned with the EU 2020 Energy Strategy, PanePowerSW not only contributes to the energy savings in buildings up to 30%, but also in greenhouses, enabling the growing of the crop while reducing energy costs, quantified in 25% of the total operational costs.",BRITE HELLAS SA
2955,"Green Energy Tracker. The international tracking system for guarantees of origin,  green energy certificates and green labels","The overall objective of the project is to provide to the green energy certificate market with a new traceability and secure system that will allow producers, traders, consumers, administrations and/or NGOs to verify and approve the real green energy origin. 

This project innovative approach is based on the application for the first time of the blockchain technology to the green certificate generation process, to create a distributed system where each transaction is encrypted and stored locally in many individual computers. Any transaction needs to be approved by a great number of members before it is exported and verify by the whole system, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries, and therefore, the fraud cases.

Green certificates are created each time one megawatt-hour of renewable energy is generated and put on the grid. Unfortunately, no matter where the electricity is generated, once the electricity enters the grid it is impossible to distinguish where it came from or how was generated. Currently this system is facing the following challenges: Lack of credibility and traceability, and fraud issues. 

With our Green Energy Tracker (GET) we are contributing to maintain a trustable renewable energy market by providing a system that Increases the credibility by substituting trust for security and traceability, eliminate fraud, increases the market efficiency and opens the possibility for new certification markets.

Our feasibility assessment under Phase I work expect to validate that the business idea is achievable by the analysis of the technical and economic related aspects with the proposal and, at the same time, identifying those key issues to face in Phase II, jointly to the clinic validation and regulatory process necessary of being developed.",MEGAVATIO CONTROL SL
3132,High quality cellulose recovery from AHP: From used diaper to coatings additive,"Every year 7.5Mton of Absorbent Hygiene Product (AHP) waste is produced in Europe. This is disposed either by landfilling or incineration. AHP waste consists of disposable child nappies, adult incontinence products, feminine hygiene and similar products. Thereof, 30% corresponding to 2.25 Mton/year can be collected as mono-stream AHP waste. However, current state of the art does not offer an economically viable solution for the recovery of raw materials from this stream. The underlying reason is that existing technology strongly depends on waste disposal gate fees and produces cellulose with a purity of typically 70-75%, which is only suitable for low grade application, e.g.as cardboard.

The main objective of the innovation project is to provide a technical solution for the recycling of high grade cellulose from AHP waste. The patented process is based on dissolving lignin with mild acids, thus upgrading the overall cellulose purity. Based on this solution a total of 360 kton of cellulose per year with a high degree of purity (> 92%) can be produced from the AHP waste. This high quality cellulose that can be used as paint additive or as chemical building block, could result in an economically viable operation without depending on gate fees. The proposed valorisation of Psiconâ€™s process represents a potential total value increase for the European economy of up to 360 Mâ‚¬/year and 2,000 new jobs. The European environment strongly benefits as CO2 emission is reduced up to 700 kton/year and reducing resources consumption by reusing them.

The long term ambition of Psicon is to create enough production sites, at strategic locations close to the feedstock, in order to be able to convert 70-80% of the mono-stream AHP waste. This is a significant step towards near-zero AHP waste in Europe. In this feasibility assessment the final hurdles will be taken towards an EU wide market introduction supported by demonstrating the process of Psicon in an operational environment.",PSICON B.V.
3291,European Research Area on Sustainable Animal Production Systems,"This proposal seeks funding under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-2015 to establish an ERA-NET for joint European research coordination on Sustainable Animal Production (SusAn). The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Sustainable Animal Production (CWG-SAP). 
Funding organisations from 22 European countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the development of a Common Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Sustainable Animal Production. 
The animal production sector forms an important part of Europeâ€™s (agricultural) economy and plays an essential role in the provision of Europe`s citizens with high quality animal products. Like other agriculture sectors, animal production faces many challenges from projected increases in global demand for food, climate change, competition for natural resources and economic volatility. The European animal production landscape is very complex, consisting of different species farmed within a wide range of different extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems using multiple resources to produce a diverse range of animal products and other services. Partners in this ERA-NET believe, however, that these challenges and complexities can be effectively addressed through joint European research within a framework which supports the three pillars of sustainability - economy, environment and society - and targets opportunities for innovative research spanning all areas of animal production such as health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, breeding and genetics, housing, nutrient management and economics.

3506,Innovative Manufacturing Routes for Next Generation Batteries in Europe,"As of today, Europe remains not competitive in terms of Lithium battery cell development and especially manufacturing. This lack of competence and competitiveness could quickly spiral down into a complete loss of this key technology for electrification in the EU. 
Thus IMAGE will significantly contribute to sustainably develop the European Li-battery cell manufacturing competence and capability by creating a competitive, production-oriented research & development framework within Europe. A realistic and well-documented roadmap towards the manufacturing of cost-effective and competitive battery cells within Europe will emerge. This will be enforced by establishing a distributed battery cell production base that will be able, after careful upscaling of production, to supply the now burgeoning electric vehicle industry. From this context, the main goal of IMAGE is to push Europeanâ€™s Li-battery industry and academia to take over a leading role in the development and manufacturing of Next Generation Li-Ion cells. IMAGE has the following major objectives: 
1) Develop generic production techniques for next generation battery cells based on high specific energy Li-metal battery cells. This will include a modular development approach that will be easy to up-scale while remaining flexible and safer to replace in case of any contingencies and market/ manufacturer configuration changes.
2) Identify energy and resource efficient cell manufacturing technologies and assets tailored to the existent European industrial infrastructure. This will include the identification of bottleneck factors and challenges that could be addressed in the present European industrial context.
3) Develop a progressive, multiple-tier technological and production framework that is able to cope with the inherent technological changes and advancements characteristic to this dynamic field. Thus, there will be several technologies covered by IMAGE, each having different technological maturity level.",AVL LIST GMBH
3913,SOlar Calcium-looping integRAtion for Thermo-Chemical  Energy Storage,"Lime (CaO) has been long proposed as an energy intensive material for the storage of energy in a chemical form by means of carbonation/calcination cycles. This Calcium-looping process (CaL) is the basis of a proven pilot-scale technology for CO2 capture, which is accomplished by carbonation of CaO and its regeneration in a calciner reactor operated under high CO2 partial pressure and high temperature. The wide availability of limestone (<10â‚¬/ton) is a key factor for the feasibility of the CaL process. However, the huge potential for lime also to store energy has been inhibited by its propensity to sinter at the high temperatures of the standard CaL cycle for CO2 capture, which reduces dramatically its multicycle conversion. SOCRATCES will be built on previous R&D results of the partners indicating that the CaL process can be integrated into CSP plants for thermochemical energy storage and power generation by means of a simple closed CO2 loop. High global efficiencies (>45%) are achieved under new CaL conditions implying carbonation under high temperature (>850ÂºC) at high CO2 partial pressure  compatible with high efficiency power blocks. Moreover, fast calcination is carried out at temperatures < 700ÂºC by the Flash Calcination technology, which allows using mature and inexpensive solar receiver technology. Circulating Fluidized Bed reactors of proven efficiency. The new CSP-CaL integration yields high storage energy density (3.2 GJ/m3) with possible long time gaps between load and discharge.  SOCRATCES is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of this integration by erecting a pilot-scale plant that uses cheap, abundant and non-toxic materials as well as mature solar and fluidized bed reactor technologies.  SOCRATCES will confer the EU a leading role on the development of efficient and non-toxic CSP with low cost storage (<12â‚¬/kWh) and LCOE <7câ‚¬/kWh.

4172,Testing and Evaluating Sophisticated information and communication Technologies for enaBling a smartEr griD,"Smart grid represents a significant new technology of improving the efficiency, reliability, and economics of the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity. It is crucial to exchange and use information for performing smart grid applications. However, in reality the exchange of information over multiple networks is unreliable, leading to unpredictable network Quality-of-Service and thus unreliable smart grid applications. Whatâ€™s worse, there are massive data, including metering data and measurement data,  structured or unstructured, making it challenging to exploit useful information. Hence, there is an urgent need to solve the research problem: how to coordinate multiple networks to reliably transmit data, and then manage ICT system resources to efficiently extract useful information for supporting smart grid applications?
TESTBED is a major interdisciplinary project that combines wisdoms in three academic disciplines - Electronics Engineering, Power Engineering and Computing Sciences, to address the aforesaid problem. The main focus is on improving the communication layer interoperability and the efficiency of data analytic. Regarding the communication layer interoperability, this project intends to develop and evaluate function-driven communication frameworks. Moreover, this project will develop and verify new data integration and analytic techniques for enhancing power grid operations. These developed frameworks and methods will be extensively tested and evaluated in 4 well-equipped Laboratories at HWU, EPRI, ICCS, and CAS. They will not only support the SGAM Framework, but also complement and enhance International Standards. 
Overall, the main objective of this project is to coordinate the action of 5 Universities and 3 enterprises, working in the field of ICT and smart grid from both EU and China, to build and test sophisticated ICT, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of smart grid applications.",UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM
4761,Integrated aquaculture based on sustainable water recirculating system for the Victoria Lake Basin (VicInAqua),"VicInAqua will follow an integrated approach in order to develop a sustainable combined sanitation and  recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for wastewater treatment and reuse in agriculture in the Victoria Lake Basin area. In this decentralized integrated treatment system wastewater from households and fish processing industry as well as RAS production water will radically reduce stress on the sensitive ecosystems of the Lake Victoria and will contribute to food and health security. It will be operated fully autonomous powered by renewable energies (PV, biogas). The RAS will particularly produce high quality fingerlings of the local fish species to supply the pond aquaculture of the area with stocking material. The innovative core idea of the project is to develop and test new technologies which enable the integration of sanitation with the aquaculture in a sustainable manner. The core of the project concept is to develop and test a novel self-cleaning water filters which consist of a highly efficient particle filter as well as a membrane bioreactor (MBR) as principal treatment unit within a combined treatment system where the nutrient rich effluent water will be used for agricultural irrigation. the surplus sludge from both filter systems will be co-digested with agricultural waste and local water hyacinth to produce biogas. The overall concept will promote sound approaches to water management for agriculture, taking into consideration broader socio-economic factors and also fomenting job creation and greater gender balance in decision-making.

4957,Positron Annihilation Detection Beyond the Limits,"Given the growth and aging of the world population, innovative solutions for sustainable energy and health are needed. Novel technologies play an enabling role in the realization of such solutions. Better devices for the detection of annihilation quanta resulting from positron annihilation are an example. In material science these detectors are needed for research on renewable energies and innovative energy storage using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). In medicine they are required for diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring of diseases using Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET).
In both fields time resolution is a key parameter. Sub-100 picosecond resolution is needed but not yet available. Improvement of time resolution, however, must not deteriorate other performance parameters. This project aims to overcome present physical limits. Monolithic scintillation crystals will be read out with digital photon counter (DPC) arrays coupled to each of its surfaces. Innovative data processing methods will be developed to eliminate the influence of scintillation photon propagation, currently the major bottleneck in large scintillation crystals that are nevertheless needed for high detection efficiency. We aim at coincidence resolving times (CRT) < 100ps FWHM, 10% energy resolution, 1 mm isotropic spatial resolution, and 90% detection efficiency.
The detector will be incorporated in a PALS setup. After the performance has been characterized, it will be used for TU Delftâ€™s materials research on renewable energy. The detector characterization will also serve as a proof-of-concept for application in clinical TOF-PET devices. The results are furthermore expected to be of relevance to fields such as high-energy physics.
To investigate options for further improvement of the already unprecedented time resolution, studies will be done towards exploiting the Cherenkov-effect in a detector based on a hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation material.",TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT

5038,"Smart TSO-DSO interaction schemes, market architectures and ICT Solutions for the integration of ancillary services from demand side management and distributed generation","The project SmartNet aims at providing architectures for optimized interaction between TSOs and DSOs in managing the exchange of information for monitoring and for the acquisition of ancillary services (reserve and balancing, voltage regulation, congestion management) both at national level and in a cross-border context. Local needs for ancillary services in distribution systems are supposed to co-exist with system needs for balancing and congestion management. Resources located in distribution systems, like demand side management and distributed generation, are supposed to participate to the provision of ancillary services both locally and for the system in the context of competitive ancillary services markets.
Through an in-depth and a simulation in a lab-environment, answers are sought for to the following questions:
â€¢	which ancillary services could be provided from distribution to the whole system (via transmission), 
â€¢	which optimized modalities could be adopted for managing the network at the TSO-DSO interface and what monitoring and control signals could be exchanged to carry out a coordinated action,
â€¢	how the architectures of the real time markets (in particular the balancing markets) could be consequently revised,
â€¢	what information has to be exchanged and how (ICT) for the coordination on the distribution-transmission border, starting from monitoring aspects, to guarantee observability and control of distributed generation, flexible demand and storage systems,
â€¢	which implications could the above issues have on the on-going market coupling process, that is going to be extended to real time markets in the next years, according to the draft Network Code on Electricity Balancing by ENTSO-E.
Different TSO-DSO interaction modalities are compared with reference to three selected national cases (Italian, Danish, Spanish) also supposing the possibility of a cross-border exchange of balancing services.

5883,Quantifying urban mines in Europe and related implications for the metal-energy-climate change nexus,"Securing access to raw materials is of particular concern for countries highly dependent on imports. This is the case of many EU States. Because of issues related to decreasing ore grades and scarcity of supply of primary metal forms, recycling of above-ground deposits of metal-bearing waste (or â€œin-use stockâ€) will become an increasingly important means of securing resources to provide essential building blocks to the European industry. Recycling of metal in-use stock has the further potential of avoiding consuming the large amounts of energy required in primary metal production, and of reducing related greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, however, because of metal losses during and after use, end-of-life recycling rates for many metals are often very low, so the potential for improving those recycling efficiencies is an important consideration for the achievement of a more resource efficient economy and sustainable development in Europe. 
This project proposes a comprehensive, exemplary research line that merges complementary drivers in the assessment of the metal-energy-climate change nexus for (i) estimating the size of current urban mines for selected, critical metals; (ii) assessing future opportunities and barriers to their recycling, and (iii) related potentials for carbon emissions reduction. The results of this project are expected to reach a wide impact in the research community and will timely inform an evidence base for future decision-making, and for enhancing the growth of European economy improving resource efficiency and recycling.

5896,Energy Efficient FPGA Accelerators for Graph Analytics Applications,"It is reported that data centers today consume up to 3 percent of the global electricity usage. This is expected to increase in the upcoming years as the amount of data processed in the cloud increases substantially. An effective way for data centers to achieve better performance and energy efficiency is to perform computation on specialized processing elements. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enable customization of logic after manufacturing to achieve better energy efficiency compared to general purpose processors. Today, prominent hardware and software companies are investing in data center solutions that integrate FPGAs with CPUs, and significant energy consumption and performance improvements have been demonstrated for several data center applications. However, the main barrier for wide spread adoption of FGPAs in data centers is the cost of programming, which typically requires months of development time by hardware designers. This makes it unaffordable for small-to-medium software companies to effectively utilize the available FPGAs. The purpose of this project is to lower this barrier for emerging graph analytics applications for knowledge discovery and machine learning. The basic idea is to use an abstract interface that allows a domain expert to describe an application as a set of serial functions defined per vertex and/or edge. We propose a customizable implementation template that automatically maps the abstract user functions to massively parallel FPGA implementations. The proposed template will hide from users many low level implementation details such as parallelization, pipelining, synchronization, memory access optimization, race and deadlock avoidance, etc. This will help bridge the gap between high level application descriptions and costly hardware implementations. Our preliminary architecture simulations have shown that the proposed graph processors can achieve significantly better energy efficiency than general purpose processors.",BILKENT UNIVERSITESI VAKIF

6796,Technology to turn waste from rapeseed oil production into valuable food protein.,"The continuing growth of world population is pushing demand for food. Climate changes and limited resources for farming lead to increased interest in new sources of nutrients alternative to meat. Additionally, human diet undergoes a significant shift towards proteins. Therefore, the growth of plant protein market is predicted to be drastically driven up in the coming years. Oilseeds, known for their high content of nutritious proteins, are expected to take center stage as main source of plant proteins aimed for human consumption. Nowadays, the main product of rapeseed processing is oil. A by-product â€“ rapeseed cake â€“ is used as animal feed. There is no commercial technology capable of extracting fully functional protein from rapeseed cake. At NapiFeryn BioTech (NFB) we came up with a new technology which allows more efficient use of this by-product. Our technology is protected with three patent applications. It enables full recovery of high-quality rapeseed cake proteins, ready to be used in food industry. Our business model is based on licensing of the technology to rapeseed processors. Licensing fee will be calculated individually for each oilseed processor or integrated formulator, based on the annual scale of the processed rapeseed. We have validated the pricing strategy with rapeseed processors. The first license agreement has been signed already in 2016. In the Ph2 project we aim primarily at delivering full-scale demonstrator (TRL9) of the rapeseed protein isolation technology at the commercial level (market launch), collect and prove all the data needed to quantify the cost-effectiveness of our technology. These activities will provide the input required for the main deliverables of the project: The Basic Engineering Level design of Biorefinery.

8045,Sub-seasonal to Seasonal climate forecasting for Energy,"Large scale deployment of renewable energy (RE) is key to comply with the GHG emissions reduction set by the COP21 agreement. Despite cost competitive in many settings, RE diffusion remains limited largely due to its variability. This works as a major barrier to REâ€™s integration in electricity networks as knowledge of power output and demand forecasting beyond a few days remains poor. To help solve this problem, S2S4E will offer an innovative service to improve RE variability management by developing new research methods exploring the frontiers of weather conditions for future weeks and months. The main output of S2S4E will be a user co-designed Decision Support Tool (DST) that for the first time integrates sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) climate predictions with RE production and electricity demand. To support the dissemination of climate services, a pilot of the DST will be developed in two steps. The first will draw on historical case studies pointed as relevant by energy companies - e.g. periods with an unusual climate behaviour affecting the energy market. The second step will improve probabilistic S2S real-time forecasts built up into the DST and assess their performances in real life decision-making in these companies. This process will be co-designed with consortiumâ€™s partners which represent different needs and interests in terms of regions, RE sources (wind, solar and hydro) and electricity demand. Besides the partners, S2S4E will engage other users from the energy sector as well as other business areas and research communities to further explore DST application and impact. As a result, DST will enable RE producers and providers, electricity network managers and policy makers to design better informed S2S strategies able to improve RE integration, business profitability, electricity system management, and GHG emissionsâ€™ reduction.

Sustainable aquaculture is undoubtedly the management technique that has most contributed to support aquaculture businesses to adopt aqua-environmental measures for protection of the environment, natural resources and landscape.
Aquaponics is known as a sustainable production system for plants and fish that combines traditional aquaculture (aquatic livestock), such as fish, crayfish and shrimp with the hydroponics (growing plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. The Aquaponics is a production system where the waste is utilized as nutrients is a system sustainable for the environment, where high-value products on the market are obtained because they are grown with organic nutrients and free of chemicals or pesticides.

8917,Concentrating Photovoltaic modules using advanced technologies and cells for highest efficiencies,"It has been proven that the only realistic path to close the gap between theoretical and practical ultra-high efficiency solar cells is the monolithic multi-junction (MJ) approach, i.e. to stack different materials on top of each other. Each material/sub solar cell converts a specific part of the sunÂ´s spectrum and thus manages the photons properly. However, large area multi-junction cells are too expensive if applied in standard PV modules. A viable solution to solve the cost issue is to use tiny solar cells in combination with optical concentrating technology, in particular, high concentrating photovoltaics (HCPV), in which the light is concentrated over the solar cells more than 500 times. The combination of ultra-high efficient cells and optical concentration lead to low cost on system level and eventually to low levelised electricity costs, today well below 8 â‚¬cent/kWh and at the end of this project below 5 â‚¬cent/kWh. Therefore, to achieve an optimised PV system (high efficiency, low cost and low environmental impact), world-wide well-known partners in the field of CPV technology propose this project to run and progress together the development of highly-efficient MJ solar cells and the improvement of the concentrator (CPV module) technique.

The central objective of the project is to realise HCPV solar cells and modules working at a concentration level â‰¥800x with world record efficiency of 48 % and 40 %, respectively, hence bringing practical performances closer to theoretical limits. This should be achieved through novel MJ solar cell architectures using advanced materials and processes for better spectral matching as well as through innovative HCPV module concepts with improved optical and interconnection designs, thus including novel light management approaches. The ambition for this project is not less than to achieve the highest efficiencies on solar cell and module level world-wide, thus Europe will be the top player for the CPV-technology.",FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.

9335,Building energy renovation through timber prefabricated modules,"About 40% of the overall energy consumption in Europe is related to the building sector and represents about 1/3 of Europeâ€™s CO2 emissions. The successful accomplishment of the emission reduction target by 2050, involves the need to increase the rate of retrofitting of the inefficient building stock up to 2.9%. In order to increase the renovation rate, more efficient renovation processes from design to manufacturing phase are needed. The use of prefabricated modules for renovation reduces on-site works, installation time, works intrusiveness, minimising the consumption of raw material; however there is a need to define holistic methodologies to adapt prefabrication processes to individual renovation solutions as well as to mass production, linked to computer design tools. 
Giving answer to the mentioned needs BERTIM will provide: (1) High energy performance prefabricated modules for deep renovation, integrating windows, insulation materials, collective HVAC systems, renewable energy systems and energy supply systems. The modules will be based in timber and recyclable materials for a low carbon foot print. The assembly system will guarantee a very little time in the installation and low disturbance to tenants. (2) An innovative holistic renovation process methodology based on a digital workflow from design to installation phase. In order to support the renovation process, a renovation project design tool oriented to SME integrating BIM with CAD/CAM tools and assuring the interoperability with CNC machines for mass manufacturing processes will be developed and implemented in three industrial settings. (3) Affordable business opportunities for different stakeholders as potential leaders in the launching of the renovation process. The whole renovation process and the developed timber modules will be validated in a full-scale research infrastructure, and then, they will be demonstrated in two real buildigns in two different climatic zones (South and North Europe).",FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION
9677,Tackling the Electronic Waste Challenge in Emerging Economies,"Electronic waste (E-waste) or waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world today. It is a complex stream of waste as it contains both hazardous chemicals and valuable/precious metal components. A major challenge for the research community, therefore, is to find effective (policy) solutions for addressing the environmental and health problems caused by E-waste management in low and mid-income countries while, at the same time, enhancing the recovery of precious metals to reuse these resources. During my Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie fellowship, I will analyse why emerging economies adopt E-waste policies that seem inadequate and ineffective in their local contexts and identify alternative approaches. In a first step, I will develop a novel analytical framework to analyse the effectiveness of E-waste policies in emerging economies and, as a second step, I will seek to explain the degree of effectiveness of E-waste policies in India and South Africa. The research aims to make conceptual, empirical and policy-relevant contributions: I strive to contribute to the academic literature by developing a novel analytical framework that helps evaluate E-waste policies in non-Western countries. Current literature on E-waste is largely based on assumptions derived from Western policies, polities and societies. By analysing the cases of India and South Africa, my research will focus on two countries whose E-waste policy has hardly been analysed. The findings of the project will provide insights that both the EU and non-European policymakers can use in their decision- making. The EU has a keen interest in supporting non-EU countries tackle their E-waste challenges through effective policies, especially since parts of the E-waste that causes problems in those countries originates from the EU and is a direct result of European consumption. I will contribute to the understanding of how such EU support could be designed.",KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN
9935,CLear Air Situation for uaS: Maturing ground based technologies for a real-time Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management System (UTMS) to monitor and separate Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) traffic,"CLASS will bring the main technologies required for surveillance of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Traffic at a better level of maturity, allowing developing a pre-operational prototype of a UAS Traffic Management System (UTMS).
CLASS will compose existing technologies to build the core functions of a UTMS:
 â€¢ real-time tracking (cooperative and non-cooperative) and display,
 â€¢ aggregation of relevant aeronautical data,
 â€¢ provide adjusted services  to each stakeholder (operators, ANSP, Authorities),
 â€¢ advanced functions such as geo-fencing (warn UAS pilot of unauthorised zones trespassing), geo-caging (warn UAS pilot if trespassing a pre-defined zone), conflict detection and resolution.
CLASS follows mainly a bottom-up approach starting from technologies up to defining a system meeting usersâ€™ operational needs for UAS Traffic Management. CLASS will consider the outcomes of the project awarded for Work Area 1 which focuses on the concept of operation.
First, CLASS will assess the performance of cooperative and non-cooperative UAS detection and tracking technologies through live experimentations. Data fusion will be developed to merge data of the same UAS detected by both cooperative and non-cooperative trackers.
Secondly, a prototype of a real-time centralized UTMS will be developed. This platform will propose an overall view of both the planned and the current real-time UAS traffic situation. Advanced functions will be implemented.
Finally, a demonstrator fed  by the real data acquired during the live experimentation, and by a UAS traffic simulator will be built. The outcomes will be evaluated through a series of Key Performance Indicators which will have been derived from the Concept of Operations.
All along the project, results will be published and shared to the UAS and the ATM community. Conclusions and recommendations for follow up will be largely disseminated to enable UAS safely operations at large scale for the benefit of the growing UAS business.",AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE SAS
10408,Towards a Joint Programming on Radioactive Waste Disposal,"The goal of this project is to prepare the setting up of a â€œJoint Programming on Radioactive Waste Disposalâ€ that would be established to coordinate at the European level, national research programmes and the associated research and development (R&D) activities on geological disposal for high activity long lived radioactive waste. This action includes reviewing of all strategic aspects linked to a stepwise move towards a Joint Programming in this field.
This project will involve organisations that are active in the safety, management and disposal of radioactive waste and research entities.
The first step of this project will be to engage in discussion with Member States representatives in order to clarify the organisation of their national R&D consistent with the implementation of the Council Directive. The second step will be to identify existing research programmes that could contribute to the identification of common scientific objectives and activities as well as specific aspects that the organisations would like to develop in the Joint Programme. The third step will be to draft the joint â€œProgramme Documentâ€ that should be the technical background of the Joint Programming. 
The outcomes of the project will be (i) a preliminary evaluation of a potential in-kind and financial commitment of organisations, (ii) a â€œProgramme Documentâ€ consisting of large programmes focused on key priorities of WMOs, TSOs side and Research Entities and (iii) a â€œSummary reportâ€ comprising a proposal for the implementation of this Joint Programming.
This action will lead to the further integration of the interested research community and hence help to maintain and develop the EU leadership in knowledge and expertise for innovative radioactive waste management solutions that effectively matches public expectations. Moreover, it will further reinforce and make the interaction at EU level between WMOs, TSOs, industry, policy makers and the research community more effective.",AGENCE NATIONALE POUR LA GESTION DES DECHETS RADIOACTIFS
10590,Advanced laser ablation barrier films for organic and large area electronic devices,"The overall objective of this project is developing organic electronic building elements on flexible substrates with monolithically integrated barrier foils as substrate. The barrier acts as the inevitable protection against atmospheric gases as water vapor and oxygen, as the most crucial agents for unwanted material degradation processes. This topic is one of the keys for enhancing both the performance of TOLAE components and addresses some of the main technology barriers of TOLAE: lifetime and cost-performance-ratio.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules have been chosen as test objects for a scalable and general approach suitable also for other TOLAE devices. Monolithical integration of barrier foils means in this case that the full device is made immediately on top of ultra-barrier coated plastic foil, which further is coated with a transparent electrode. This leads to significant cost reduction, which is one of the key needs for wider use of TOLAE devices.
The project ALABO develops direct laser scribing processes on flexible substrates, coated with ultra-barrier systems. The project results will be applicable to a number of TOLAE technologies, such as OPV, OLED, OTFT and thin-film inorganic PV on polymer foil substrates. The consortium will investigate and develop new manufacturing processes, which will increase the performance and functionality of TOLAE devices suitable for smart systems. OPV can be part of such smart TOLAE systems. By developing direct laser structuring on top of such ultra-barrier foil, the consortium develops advanced materials, as well as new production technologies supported by dedicated monitoring and material testing technologies for well-scalable manufacturing processes. As an outcome, more functionality will be integrated into less material, since in - contrast to state-of-the-art encapsulation processes - the devices will need only one foil per side, instead of at least two today.",FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.
10855,Hydraulics modelling for drilling automation,"Societal uses for the drilling of deep wells are abundant and have enormous impact on global economies; examples include the exploration of minerals, geothermal energy, oil and gas. The future sustainable harvesting of these resources requires the exploitation of difficult-to-access, unconventional reserves and is threatened by concerns on the environmental safety and high cost of drilling operations. To overcome these threats, there are strong needs for advanced tools for virtual drilling scenario testing and drilling automation and for multidisciplinary employees with adequate technical and transferable skills.

The HYDRA EID research and training program addresses both needs by founding an intersectoral doctoral school. The consortium represents top-level expertise in all scientific and engineering disciplines needed to take on the main challenges of HYDRA: multiphase flow dynamics, model reduction, control and mathematics. Moreover, the consortium houses expertise ranging from academic research & training (TU/e, MINES) and industrial R&D (Kelda) to industrial practice and training (MH Wirth, Well Academy), therewith offering a broad spectrum of training.

The scientific objective of HYDRA is to develop a framework for multi-phase hydraulic modeling and model complexity reduction for drilling operations, delivered in software directly usable in industry. The resulting models uniquely combine high predictive capacity and low complexity enabling their usage in both virtual drilling scenario testing and drilling automation. The main training objective is to launch 3 doctoral students into future leading scientific positions with an intersectoral network to support them throughout their careers.

The envisioned results form the necessary basis for revolutionary advances in the (environmental) safety and cost-effectiveness of resource exploration in Europe and beyond and will provide the human capital base for sustaining such efforts beyond this programâ€™s lifetime.",TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN
10995,"Improvement of energy efficiency in industrial water circuits using gamification for online self-assessment, benchmarking and economic decision support","The improvement of energy efficiency across European industry is crucial for competitiveness. So far, the measures for improvement of energy efficiency have been directed at primary production processes. In this project, we will address the improvement of energy efficiency in industrial water circuits: auxiliary electric motor driven systems with high optimisation potential. The European manufacturing industry consumes about 37 000 million mÂ³/y freshwater recycling it up to 10 times with the specific electrical energy consumption >0.2 kWh/mÂ³. By the according energy consumption of 74 000 GWh/a the potential 10% savings amount to 7 400 GWh/a. Currently, there is neither a benchmark on the energy consumption in industrial water circuits, nor tools for its systematic reduction, nor awareness of the saving potential. The WaterWatt project aims to remove market barriers for energy efficient solutions, in particular the lack of expertise and information on energy management and saving potential in industrial water circuits. The aims will be achieved through: i) case studies in relevant industries, ii) development of improvement measures for energy efficiency in industrial water circuits, iii) market studies, iv) capacity building activities and v) dissemination in workshops and by e-learning. An Energy Efficiency Evaluation Platform (E3 Platform) will be developed to disseminate knowledge/know-how on energy efficiency improvements using gaming approach. The tools of EÂ³ Platform will be used by SMEs and large industrial producers for self-assessment and improvement of the energy efficiency in their circuits.  WaterWatt will reach more than 2000 relevant persons, organisations and policy makers triggering investments of â‚¬7-12 million resulting in primary energy saving of 100-180 GWh/a during the project life-time.

11069,SUstainability-driven international/intersectoral Partnership for Education and Research on modelling next generation CONCRETE,"SUPERCONCRETE is a synergetic cross-disciplinary international/intersectoral project addressing theoretical models for next-generation concretes, characterised by a significant sustainability enhancement for the construction industry. 

Three advanced concrete classes (CCs) are selected which represent the projectsâ€™ key research lines:
- Low-Carbon Concrete (LCC), characterised by non-conventional constituents, often derived from recycling industrial waste or by-products;
- High-Class Concrete (HCC), encompassing materials with enhanced performance in strength,  durability;
- Fibre-reinforced Cementitious Composites (FCC), with special features on fibre/textile reinforcement and matrix improvement.

Developing synergetic through-life multi-scale models for these novel materials is the key objective of the SUPERCONCRETE project. Particularly, three transversal modelling issues (MIs) are considered:
- Rheology and Early age, dealing with the various physical and coupled thermo-hygro-chemical phenomena taking place in the first hours after mixing;
- Hardened state and service life, approached by constitutive modelling intended at predicting the instantaneous and long-term behaviour, for both service and ultimate conditions;
- Extreme conditions, based on constitutive theories capable of simulating the response under fire and high temperature exposure.

Each CC and MI is covered by one participant and the interactions among them is based on a matrix-like organisational approach aiming at achieving a true synergistic collaboration among those with specific CC knowledge and the ones bringing in transversal competences on MIs. A further cross-cutting objective aims at defining a  â€œSustainability Indexâ€, based on its constituents and processes requested for each CC.

SUPERCONCRETEâ€™s final deliverables will be 1) a joint international course on sustainable concretes with 2) an underlying textbook and 3) a web-based platform for interacting with students and practitioners.",UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI SALERNO
11324,Application Centric IP/Optical Network Orchestration,"The Internet has evolved into a three layer structure: at the top layer sit the applications generating traffic that is groomed at the IP and/or OTN layers and finally transported at the optical layer. Specific application needs, such as latency or protection requirements, are seldom guaranteed, because they are usually implicit and even when they are not, the need of the grooming layer to map large numbers of small flows into the small numbers of very large and static lightpaths is an obstacle to effective service fulfillment.

ACINO proposes a novel application-centric network concept, which differentiates the service offered to each application all the way down to the optical layer, thereby overcoming the disconnect that the grooming layer causes between service requirements and their fulfillment in the optical layer. This allows catering to the needs of emerging medium-large applications, such as database migration in data centers. To realize this vision, ACINO aims to develop an open source, vendor-agnostic modular orchestrator, which will expose to applications a set of high level primitives for specifying service requirements, and then perform multi-layer (IP and optical) planning and optimization processes to map these requirements into a set of lightpaths. The orchestrator will also be able to perform re-optimization, by means of a novel online in-operation planning module. The ACINO consortium has strong industrial foundations, and plans to demonstrate the advantages of its approach in a testbed with commercial equipment in a carrier environment.

ACINOâ€™s approach directly addresses the lack of dynamic control of optical networks, by automating planning and configuration tasks, and tackles the limitations in inter data center connectivity by allowing applications to request detailed and complex custom services to be provisioned in a timely manner. Overall, ACINOâ€™s open source and vendor-agnostic approach will foster the emergence of open industry standards.",CREATE-NET (CENTER FOR RESEARCH AND TELECOMMUNICATION EXPERIMENTATION FOR NETWORKED COMMUNITIES)

TANDEM long-term goal is to make it possible for researchers and academics to contribute with their peers around the world to the socio-economic development of the West and Central African Region. To this end, TANDEM is structured around three objectives:

1. Enhance the dialogue between WACREN and policy makers, international donors and regulating authorities, in order to promote connectivity and obtain political and financial support;
2. Enhance the dialogue between WACREN, end users, national research and education networks (NRENs) and research and tertiary education institutes, in order to identify the global e-infrastructure services expected by the end users;
3. Build a permanent stakeholder dialogue by creating favourable conditions for the implementation of three main communities: the â€œpolicy makers, donors and regulating authoritiesâ€ community; the NRENs community; the â€œend usersâ€ community.

TANDEM provides for the implementation of a virtual collaboration platform in order to support the continuity of communities beyond the end of the project, and to enable monitoring of the e-infrastructure services. In order to respond to the growing demand from African research communities, TANDEM is focused on three key research thematic topics: health, food security, and environment; and on the specific needs of these areas.

11524,Supporting Sustainable Energy Production from Biomass from Landscape Conservation and Maintenance Work,"The aim of greenGain is to strengthen the energy use of regional and local biomass from the maintenance of areas and landscape elements, which is performed in the public interest. The scope of the biomass used,  will be any material predominantly produced from nature conservation and landscape management, but not from energy-crops. 

The main target groups are regional and local players, who are responsible for maintenance and conservation work and for the biomass residue management in their regions. Moreover, the focus will be on service providers - including farmers and forest owners, their associations, NGOs and energy providers and consumers.

The project will show strategies to build up reliable knowledge on local availability of these feedstocks and know-how on issues from logistics to storage and sustainable conversion pathways for the transformation of these feedstocks to renewable energy (heat and energy products). Furthermore political, legal and environmental aspects will be addressed in model regions. Awareness raising, governance and public acceptance actions will be focussed on. General guidelines will be prepared to guarantee a wide dissemination to other regions in the EU. The regional partners will be actively supported by Technical Partners for the project measuresâ€™ development and implementation.

As a CSA, the project focal point will be the exchange between the model regions and other similar relevant players in the EU, by good practice exchange, a topic-specific website, several workshops and educational site visits in different regions as well as other standard public relations activities.

The project team is carefully balanced between technical and scientific organisations and local demand side oriented players.

11789,ImplementatioN in real SOFC Systems of monItoring and diaGnostic tools using signal analysis to increase tHeir lifeTime,"The INSIGHT project aims at developing a Monitoring, Diagnostic and Lifetime Tool (MDLT) for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) stacks and the hardware necessary for its implementation into a real SOFC system. The effectiveness of the MDLT will be demonstrated through on-field tests on a real micro-Combined Heat and Power system (2.5 kW), thus moving these tools from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to beyond 5. 

INSIGHT leverages the experience of previous projects and consolidates their outcomes both at methodological and application levels. The consortium will specifically exploit monitoring approaches based on two advanced complementary techniques: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in addition to conventional dynamic stack signals. Durability tests with faults added on purpose and accelerated tests will generate the data required to develop and validate the MDL algorithms. Based on the outcome of experimental analysis and mathematical approaches, fault mitigation logics will be developed to avoid stack failures and slow down their degradation. 

A specific low-cost hardware, consisting in a single board able to embed the MDLT will be developed and integrated into a commercial SOFC system, the EnGenTM 2500, which will be tested on-field. 

INSIGHT will then open the perspective to decrease the costs of service and SOFC stack replacement by 50%, which would correspond to a reduction of the Total Cost of Ownership by 10% / kWh.

To reach these objectives, INSIGHT is a cross multidisciplinary consortium gathering 11 organisations from 6 member states (France, Italy, Denmark, Slovenia, Austria, Finland) and one associated country (Switzerland). The partnership covers all competences necessary: experimental testing (CEA, DTU, EPFL), algorithms developments (UNISA, IJS, AVL), hardware development (BIT), system integration and validation (VTT, SP, HTC), supported by AK for the project management and dissemination.",COMMISSARIAT A L ENERGIE ATOMIQUE ET AUX ENERGIES ALTERNATIVES
12042,Towards New Generation of Solid-State Photovoltaic Cell: Harvesting Nanotubular Titania and Hybrid Chromophores,"In photovoltaics (PVs), a significant scientific and technological attention has been given to technologies that have the potential to boost the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency and to power recently unpowerable devices and objects. The research of various solar cell concepts for diversified applications (building integrated PVs, powering mobile devices) has recently resulted in many innovations. However, designs and concepts of solar cells fulfilling stringent criteria of efficiency, stability, low prize, flexibility, transparency, tunable cell size, esthetics, are still lacking.  
Herein, the research focus is given to a new physical concept of a solar cell that explores extremely promising materials, yet unseen and unexplored in a joint device, whose combination may solve traditional solar cells drawbacks (carrier recombination, narrow light absorption). 
It features a high surface area interface (higher than any other known PVs concept) based on ordered anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays, homogenously infilled with nanolayers of high absorption coefficient crystalline chalcogenide or organic chromophores using different techniques, yet unexplored for this purpose. After addition of supporting constituents, a solid-state solar cell with an extremely large incident area for the solar light absorption and optimized electron pathways will be created. The CHROMTISOL solar cell concept bears a large potential to outperform existing thin film photovoltaic technologies and concepts due to unique combination of materials and their complementary properties. 

The project aims towards important scientific findings in highly interdisciplinary fields. Being extremely challenging and in the same time risky, it is based on feasible ideas and steps, that will result in exciting achievements.

Space cooling, owing to vast dissipation of the heat from the data-processing equipment to data centre space, has a very high cooling capacity, accounting for 30-40% of energy delivered into the space. Developing an effective heat removal and recovery system to prevent excessive equipment heat transmission to the space is critical to reducing energy consumption of the cooling system. The proposed MSCA programme aims to investigate an innovative a novel Loop-Heat-Pipe-based data centre heat removal and recovery system employing the micro-channels-cold/hot-plates(LHP-C/H-PLATE-4-DC), by integrating the excellence of the host applicants in loop-heat-pipe(LHP) and expertise of the researcher applicant in hot/cold plates for data processing equipment. The innovative features of the system lie in (1) microscopic interior spaces increase liquid evaporation rate and heat transfer of the LHPs; (2) sensor-controlled liquid upper-feeding and liquid/vapour separator prevent the dry-out and entrainment effects of the conventional LHPs; (3) flat-plate surface of the cold-plate enables a perfect contact with the skin of the data-processing equipment; and (4) novel heat/mass transfer analysis approaches employing the latest fractal and enthalpy/temperature-difference-driven heat transfer theories. The programme tasks include (a) concept development; (b) computer modelling; (c) prototype construction & testing; and (d) economic & environmental analyses.

12414,Degradable Polyolefin Materials Enabled by Catalytic Methods,"Plastics are essential to virtually any modern technology and therefore ubiquitious. However, when released to the environment they can persist for centuries. One pillar of a responsible future economy is therefore to endow important plastics with a non-persistent nature. Polyethylene (PE) is the largest scale synthetic material, used in transportation, energy storage, water cleaning, clothing and many other fields. However, it is most problematic concerning degradability.  This proposal addresses this major challenge by introducing photo- and hydrolytically degradable groups in the PE chain. Directly during catalytic PE synthesis, isolated keto groups will be generated by incorporation of small amounts of carbon monoxide. This yet unachieved goal is targeted via catalysts with extreme shielding and rigid ligand environments in heterobimetallic Ni(II) / main group metal complexes. A compartmentalized aqueous polymerization with precise control of high ethylene/CO ratios will yield the in-chain functionalized PE as nano- and microscale particle dispersions. Living catalytic polymerization in nanoparticles is pursued to achieve ultra high molecular weights and gradient PE chains forming nanodomains varying in ketone density. Aqueous heterophase oxidation with benign oxidants on all these nanoparticle will yield in-chain ester groups. Further types of hydrolytically cleavable groups are targeted via the complementary synthetic approach of step growth from seed- or microalgae-oil derived PE-telechelics. This yields linear PE with in-chain carbonate, acetal and anhydride groups. Basic materials properties of all polymers are determined by tensile tests. Degradation studies reflecting a marine environment will indicate the persistency behaviour and fate of microfragments, using macroscopic specimens and the above particles as models. Knowledge of the particle and bulk morphologies will be instrumental to understand the materials and degradation properties.",UNIVERSITAT KONSTANZ
12457,"PLASTtics to be CLEANED by sorting and separation of plastics and subsequent recycling of polymers, bromine flame retardants and antimony trioxide","1.2 Million tons of mixed plastics arise from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) treatment in Europe and this quantity is still growing. WEEE plastics often contain undesired additives that hamper recycling in Europe. 75% of WEEE is currently exported to Asia where it is recycled to secondary plastics containing undesired (hazardous) substances or ending up in landfill where leaching occurs. Hence for WEEE plastics a closed loop solution is needed. 
PLAST2bCLEANEDâ€™s aim is to develop a recycling process for WEEE plastics in a technically feasible, environmentally sound and economically viable manner. To fulfil this aim, PLAST2bCLEANED addresses the recycling of the most common WEEE plastics acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) that contain up to 20wt% brominated flame retardants (BFR) and up to 5wt% of the synergist antimony trioxide (ATO). PLAST2bCLEANED will close three loops: (1) polymer, (2) bromine, and (3) ATO. 
Key technologies developed within the project are: (1) improved sorting of HIPS and ABS that contain BFR from other polystyrene and ABS fractions; (2) dissolution of WEEE plastics in superheated solvents; (3) separation of additives to concentrate BFR and ATO fractions for recycling; (4) energy efficient recovery of solvent and of polymer. The developed technology will be integrated in a pilot facility with capacity of 2 kg/hr (TRL 6) delivering polymer samples. The developed technology can be applied to similar waste streams from other sectors, e.g. automotive.  
The combination of improved sorting and use of superheated solvents offers an economic and environmental advantage. First calculations indicate a sound business case: ABS can be recovered with the superheated solvent dissolution process at a cost of 470 â‚¬/ton compared to 890 â‚¬/ton for the alternative process Creasolv.

It is evident that this will generate a market pull towards the development of new water treatment technologies, employing new materials or improving the integration of existing technologies. However, the integration of research and innovation within the water sector needs to be supported by education of a new generation of interdisciplinary trained wastewater professionals able to face future challenges and implement wastewater-related directives in practice.

12833,Molecular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal death in motor neuron diseases,"The mechanisms behind neuronal death in different motor neuron diseases (MND) remain unknown. These MNDs include the devastating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A fascinating question in neurodegeneration research is why mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes result in the selective death of a specific neuronal subtype. The ubiquitously expressed and conserved survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein receives its name because its deficit results in MN degeneration. However, SMN known functions -spliceosome assembly and axonal mRNA transport- do not explain the selective MN vulnerability. 
Accumulation of intracellular aggregates in neurons is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. The lysosome-autophagy system is the main catabolic pathway for recycling of protein aggregates and damaged organelles, and its role as a quality control system is especially critical in neurons, due to their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. The hypothesis for this proposal is that SMN deficiency leads to a lysosome-autophagy dysfunction which results in a proteostatic failure, underlying MN degeneration. Furthermore, the existing heterogeneity in SMN protein levels across MN populations may determine their probability of survival. 
To test these hypotheses we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically engineer human control, SMA and ALS patient-derived iPSCs to generate isogenic and reporter lines that will allow us to study selective neuronal subtypes at a single-cell level. We will also follow an interdisciplinary approach using a SMA Drosophila model to identify new molecular pathways essential for SMN neuropathology. Altogether, my research proposal aims at untangling the molecular mechanisms underlying selective MN death. Our results will open up new directions of research into the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and will provide clues for the design of therapeutics targeting specific neuronal types or phases of MNDs.",AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DEINVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS
13431,European School on Artificial Leaf : Electrodes  Devices,"Climate change resulting from accumulation of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the uncertainty in the
amount of recoverable fossil fuel reserves are driving forces for the development of renewable, carbon-neutral energy
technologies. Artificial photosynthesis appears to be an appealing approach for a sustainable energy generation as it
produces â€œsolar fuelsâ€ or commodities for chemistry in a stable and storable chemical form, from solar energy, H2O & CO2.
The eSCALED project is a contribution to structure early-stage research training at the European level and strengthen
European innovation capacity to elaborate an artificial leaf. The ESR will be in charge of combining in a unique device a

13642,Blue Combustion for the Storage of Green Electrical Power,"The detrimental consequences of global warming and the scarceness of fossil energy resources make an increasing use of renewable energy sources imperative. However, the inherent volatility of most of these energy sources requires both the installation of fast fossil backup power and large amounts of storage capacity. In the ERC funded project GREENEST the fundamentals of an ultra-wet gas turbine cycle are developed. In the proposed project BlueStep :  Blue Combustion for the Storage of Green Electrical Power, the idea of ultra-wet combustion is extended towards the demonstration of a very effective and clean energy storage and conversion technology. Excess renewable electrical energy is utilized in a high pressure electrolysis process to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Both gases are stored at high pressure and their combustion, referred to as blue combustion, can be directly incorporated in existing base load steam power plants, resulting in the BlueStep cycle. Combustion takes place in the steam cycle of the plant and the exhaust gases consist solely of steam that can further expand in the remaining stages of the closed steam cycle. Depending on the mode of application, the power output of the plant and the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced significantly. The proposed BlueStep cycle outclasses competing technologies in terms of efficiency, flexibility, space requirements, and investment costs. In a highly conservative market sector the proposed technology offers an economical and efficient method to realize extensive energy storage. The proposal comprises two key aspects: (1) the demonstration of diluted hydrogen-oxygen combustion under engine conditions to prove the technical feasibility of the technique to future customers; and (2) the development of a thorough business plan for the construction and operation of a full scale BlueStep energy storage plant to show the high economic potential of the concept to future investors.",TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT BERLIN
14216,Drivers and impacts of invertebrate herbivores across forest ecosystems globally.,"Forests slow global climate change by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide but this ecosystem service is limited by soil nutrients. Herbivores potentially alter soil nutrients in a range of ways, but these have mostly only been recorded for large mammals. By comparison, the impacts of the abundant invertebrates in forests have largely been ignored and are not included in current models used to generate the climate predictions so vital for designing governmental policies
The proposed project will use a pioneering new interdisciplinary approach to provide the most complete picture yet available of the rates, underlying drivers and ultimate impacts of key nutrient inputs from invertebrate herbivores across forest ecosystems worldwide. Specifically, we will:

(1) Establish a network of herbivory monitoring stations across all major forest types, and across key environmental gradients (temperature, rainfall, ecosystem development).
(2) Perform laboratory experiments to examine the effects of herbivore excreta on soil processes under different temperature and moisture conditions.
(3) Integrate this information into a cutting-edge ecosystem model, to generate more accurate predictions of forest carbon sequestration under future climate change.

The network established will form the foundation for a unique long-term global monitoring effort which we intend to continue long after the current funding time scale. This work represents a powerful blend of several disciplines harnessing an array of cutting edge tools to provide fundamentally novel insights into an area of direct and urgent importance for the society.",LUNDS UNIVERSITET

To strengthen the biosecurity against these pathogens, new, science-based and socially acceptable forest protection solutions need to be developed. The research in RESISTREE will target central knowledge gaps related to a crucial phase of a biological invasion, the establishment phase. Specifically, RESISTREE will deliver in-depth information about the host phenotypic traits and associated mycobiome that can suppress establishment of the invasive Phytophthora-species (Oomycetes) on one of the key stone species of European forests, the European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). We will test hypotheses about (1) H1 - Endophyte assemblages differ between healthy and Phytophthora-infected beech trees; (2) H2 - Certain endophytic fungi (individual species or groups) limit the growth of Phytophthora-species through different mechanisms; (3) H3 - Lesion formation in beech tissues depends on the quality or quantity of endophytic infections in the tissue; and (4) H4 - Phytophthora root infection influences the growth and morphology of seedlings before visible symptoms (chlorosis,lesions) appear. RESISTREE combines theory and methods from ecology, cell biology, mycology and forest pathology, resulting in an original, multidisciplinary research with high potential for ground-breaking findings. RESISTREE will promote transfer of knowledge between academia and the private sector, resulting in an interdisciplinary project.

Developments in photochemistry and laser beam forming will allow to produce structures at different scales (100 nm to 10 microns). An unedited productivity in freeform fabrication of 3D structures will trigger the manufacturing of new and powerful optostructures with applications in lighting, displays, sensing, etc.
The novelty focuses on the combination of ultrasensitive nonlinear photocurable materials, and the laser projection of up to 1 million simultaneous laser spots. The photochemistry relies on new types of ultrasensitive photoinitiators and groundbreaking nonlinear sensitized resins for CW [Continuous Wave] laser writing. The developments in beam forming are based in modulation with SLMs [Spatial Light Modulators] and hybrid diffractive optics for massive 3D parallelization by imaging and holographic projection.
The enabled optical structures (hybrid microlenses, waveguides, polarizers, metasurfaces and holograms) will be modelled at the micro and macroscale, to develop application oriented simulation and design methodologies.
Selected demonstrators will show the capability to produce 3D optical micro-nanostructured components with unique optical characteristics, offering differential advantages in many products: advanced security holograms, efficient lighting, high performance optics, backlighting units for displays, holographic HMIs [Human Machine Interface] and planar concentrator microlenses.

These nanomaterials offer a unique opportunity for low-cost high efficiency all-inorganic solar cells. Despite the great efforts though, only a limited number of colloidal NC compounds has been successfully employed, which either rely on costly and scarce elements or toxic materials. HEINSOLÂ´s mission is to develop the first highly efficient, robust solution processed solar cell platform based on environmentally friendly, Earth abundant materials. To achieve this, HEINSOL undertakes a hierarchical approach to tailor the opto-electronic properties of inorganic NCs, starting from the control of composition and their properties at the atomic level and following up with further tailoring their optoelectronic properties via interactions at the supra-nanocrystalline level. HEINSOL, at the atomic level, will develop novel doping schemes for colloidal NCs to tailor their electronic character as well as passivation schemes to reduce the density of unfavourable trap states. At the supra-nanocrystalline level, HEINSOL will explore novel nano-heterojunctions that cater for efficient charge separation and suppressed recombination, elements of paramount importance in high performance solar cells. The microscopic properties of the NCs will be correlated with the macroscopic properties of the NC composites in operating devices, a methodology that will provide new insights on the underlying mechanisms at the nanoscale that govern the properties of those devices.

Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) is a highly innovative technology for conversion of salinity gradient energy into electricity. Water electrolysis is a promising option for hydrogen production from renewable energy resources. Recently, a novel approach combining RED and Alkaline Polymer Electrolyte Water Electrolysis (APEWE) was reported for sustainable hydrogen production. However, this process achieved low efficiency: RED suffers from the negative impact of multivalent ions on power generation, whereas APEWE lacks highly conducive and stable membrane separators and polymer binders. The MARVEL project aims to i) endow monovalent ion selectivity for RED membranes to reduce the influence of multivalent ions ii) develop novel, fully characterized membrane separators and polymer binders for APEWE iii) test RED-APEWE process with these new materials iv) perform a techno-economic assessment for commercial feasibility. The ultimate goal of MARVEL is to broaden the knowledge and expertise of the researcher, Dr. Ramato Ashu Tufa, through high-quality research training in the emergig area of renewable energy involving multidisciplinary investigation approaches and intersectoral secondments. This allows him to establish a long-standing relationship with his institute and increase his professional network across Europe. An effective dissemination of project results and knowledge will be implemented through presentations of results in major conference, seminars, publications in high-impact peer reviewed journals, project web page, open days etc. Profound outputs from MARVEL will significantly contrubte towards establishment of a strong scientific and technical base for European science and technology, foster the competitiveness and growth of EU economy with a positive impact on the major objectives of energy policy for sustainability and security.",VYSOKA SKOLA CHEMICKO-TECHNOLOGICKA V PRAZE
16740,Ethanol production from microalgae and lignocellulosic biomass.,"The European Union (EU) set-out an ambitious but achievable plan that by 2030 up to one-quarter of the total transport fuel demand should be met by clean and CO2-efficient biofuels to curb greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from fossil fuels and its impact on global climate change. The EU 2006 Biofuel policy has clearly stated that the search for alternative pathways for renewable energy sources will result in considerable growth in biofuel technologies and industry sectors in the coming years. Therefore, sustainable, energy efficient and innovative technologies are needed to produce biofuels from a wide range of raw materials feedstocks while adhering to the societal, economic and environmental norms of the EU. As an alternative to this conflict, the exploitation of new materials, such as residual biomass of lignocellulosic nature and aquatic (microalgae), can be an important strategy for the reconciliation of economic growth and environmental sustainability in the long term. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) produced from agricultural and forestry residues including, among others, sugarcane bagasse have been considered as a generous source, which does not compete with food requirements and is one of the most abundant and promising biomass sources in the world, obtained from the processing of sugarcane. Microalgae are primitive plant organisms with no roots, stems or leaves, that can be found in all terrestrial ecosystems. Microalgal biomass is frequently rich in fatty acids, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins such as riboflavin, thiamine, carotene and folic acid, among others are of high value. From the above, this project proposes the bioethanol production from a biomass mixture of the microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis and lignocellulosic hydrolysate sugarcane bagasse, focusing on the development of a fermentation technology to convert the pentoses and hexoses present in the biomass to bioethanol.",INSTITUTO SUPERIOR DE ENGENHARIA DO PORTO
16747,Intelligent Grid Platform,"The energy sector is going through a transformation from a one directional centralized system in which energy is produced by a limited number of big power plants into a highly decentralized ecosystem due to the introduction of small-scale renewable energies and the electrification of mobility. In this situation, power distribution grid operatorsâ€™ current workflows and IT systems cause inconsistent data management which complicates their planning and operation activities. Therefore, essential grid planning and operation workflows involve significant manual input. As a result, e.g. the evaluation of a connection request for a single new wind turbine often takes multiple days. Additionally, Smart Grid Technologies cannot be used to their full extent to avoid curtailment of renewables in congestion management, and to substitute conventional expensive grid capacity expansions.
We have developed the Intelligent Grid Platform (IGP), the only integral software solution using machine learning algorithms to allow grid operators to reduce their operational and network expansion investment costs by giving them the means to clean and connect their data, digitize and automate their grid planning and operation activities and to more easily integrate smart grid technologies to help their operation processes and avoid expensive network capacity extensions. As a result, they save time and engineering resources by up to 70% and reduce grid operation and expansion costs by 40% to 60%. In this project, we will advance the IGP applications for online gird operation.",ENVELIO GMBH
17214,Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles,"Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles ((H)EVs) are essential for the transition towards sustainable e-mobility. The permanent magnets in motors/generators of (H)EVs are either NdFeB or SmCo magnets, which contain large quantities of rare earths, which are critical metals with the highest supply risk for Europe. As highlighted by the European Rare Earths Competency Network, recycling of rare-earth magnets from (H)EVs should receive top priority. Reclaiming of rare-earth magnet motors/generators used in (H)EVs is a major challenge because the magnets are difficult to remove from the assemblies. The conventional hydrometallurgical routes for the recovery of rare earths from End-of-Life permanent magnets have a high environmental impact due to inefficient use of chemicals, whereas the conventional pyrometallurgical routes for the production of magnet master alloys are energy-inefficient. DEMETER, the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles, concurrently develops (1) innovative, environmentally-friendly direct and indirect recycling strategies for the permanent magnets in the motors and generators of (H)EVs that are currently already on the market and (2) design-for-reuse solutions for motors and generators in the (H)EVs of the future. An intersectoral and interdisciplinary consortium of leading EU universities, research institutes and manufacturers from the automotive and magnet sector trains 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs). The research challenges include the development of hydrogen-based grain-refinement technologies to produce nanograin magnets directly from scrap magnets, the recovery of rare earths from SmCo and NdFeB magnets of motors/generators by ionometallurgical methods, and the design of motors/generators with reusable magnets, where the designs are based on 2D and 3D flux paths as well as non-traditional materials.",KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN
17346,Two Dimensional Materials for Photonic Devices,"The need for inexpensive yet highly efficient photodetectors and solar cells is driving the search for a new generation of semiconductors that have high absorbance in the visible, broad wavelength operation range, are transparent and flexible albeit with strong light-matter interaction, and are easy to process. Manufacturing these optoelectronic devices at a large scale involves concerns at technological, economical, ecological, social and political levels. Ideally, the new materials are abundant, easily processed and feature long term stability and non-toxicity. The advent of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). e.g., MoS2 and WS2, has generated great expectations since these materials fulfill all these requirements. 2D-TMDCs exhibit direct band gaps, high absorption coefficients, and high carrier mobility values, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. The out-of-plane quantum confinement responsible for the direct bandgap in the monolayer, also allows for the modulation of the bandgap as a function of the number of layers. However, for photovoltaics (PV), even if transparency is an important attribute in some niche markets, e.g. building-integrated PV, thickness-limited absorption poses a challenge in general. To overcome this issue, we propose a photonic nanostructuration to maximize light harvesting in these devices. We will combine strong interference effects based in the small penetration in a metallic substrate and the light trapping due to the nanostructuration by lithography of TMDCs over a metallic substrate. Resonators with high-quality factors will have potential applications in light harvesting devices, such as photodetectors, but also in solar cells. We will design and fabricate such an efficient photodetector, and also a solar cell incorporating the photonic design, and demonstrate enhanced performance in a metal back reflector/TMDC/graphene device.",LABORATORIO IBERICO INTERNACIONAL DE NANOTECNOLOGIA

In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than â‚¬60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow â€“ such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 daysâ€™ downtime per fault over current methods",ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SERVICES LIMITED

Currently, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (= CIGS(e)) TF solar cells have high efficiency, but also a simple one-dimensional cell design with stability and reliability concerns. Furthermore, its present research has been mainly focused on improving the absorber and buffer layers. 
Scientifically, Uniting PV aims to study the practical boundaries of CIGS(e) TF solar cell efficiency. For that reason, its goal is to revolutionize the design of CIGS(e) solar cells through implementation of advanced three-dimensional silicon (Si) solar cell concepts. This novel design consists of (i) surface passivation layers and (ii) light management methods integrated into ultra-thin (UT) CIGS(e) solar cells: (i) Passivation layers will be studied to reduce charge carrier recombination at CIGS(e) surfaces. The aim is to create new understanding and thus scientific models. (ii) Light management methods will be studied to optimize optical confinement in UT CIGS(e) layers. The aim is to examine the interaction between light management and charge carrier recombination in UT CIGS(e), and to create scientific models. The main reasons to introduce these developments is to reduce charge carrier recombination at the CIGS(e) surfaces and in the CIGS(e) bulk, while maintaining optical confinement. 
Technologically, the project targets to establish a solar cell with: (1) Increased cell efficiency, at least 23.0 % and up to 26.0 %; (2) improved stability and reliability, due to reduced CIGS(e) thickness and passivation layers hindering alkali metal movement; and (3) reduced cost, due to the use of less Ga and In, and industrially viable materials, methods and equipment. Hence, its outcome will be upscalable, valuable for other TF PV materials, and start a new wave of innovation in and collaboration between TF and Si PV research fields.",INTERUNIVERSITAIR MICRO-ELECTRONICA CENTRUM

To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:

(1) High energy efficiency and density;
(2) Small size and low weight;
(3) High reliability;
(4) Compliance with existing standards and regulation; and
(5) High cost-efficiency.

Any energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.

Worldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.

With its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.","CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION COOPERATIVA DE ENERGIAS ALTERNATIVAS FUNDACION, CIC ENERGIGUNE FUNDAZIOA"
18782,Stable and High-Efficiency Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes,"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which emit light by a solid-state process called electroluminescence, are considered as the most promising energy-efficient technology for future lighting and display. It has been demonstrated that optimal use of LEDs could significantly reduce the worldâ€™s electricity use for lighting from 20% to 4%. However, current LED technologies typically rely on expensive high-vacuum manufacturing processes, hampering their widespread applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-cost LEDs based on solution-processed semiconductors. 

A superstar in the family of solution-processed semiconductors is metal halide perovskites, which have shown great success in photovoltaic applications during the past few years. The same perovskites can also been applied in LEDs. Despite being at an early stage of development with associated challenges, metal halide perovskites provide great promise as a new generation of materials for low-cost LEDs.

This project aims to develop high-efficiency and stable perovskite LEDs based on solution-processed perovskites. Two different classes of low-dimensional perovskites will be investigated independently. These new perovskites materials will then be coupled with novel interface engineering to fabricate perovskite LEDs with the performance beyond the state of the art.

Also in Europe, the number of plastic street containers for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) exceeds ten million. The average lifetime of these articles ranges from five to ten years. When they break, these items are discarded and replaced with new ones. Discarded items have three destinations: recycling, incineration or as landfill. The owners of these plastic elements barely consider the possibility of their repair.
At Plastic Repair System, we have developed and patented an industrial technology for the repair of reusable plastic articles, which allows their use with total confidence and guarantees, while the cost of repair is less than one third of the new value of the same article. Repairs undertaken with PRS technology have been analysed by independent laboratories that have certified that PRS recovers 100% of the object's functionality and at least 98% of its original strength. 
The industrialization of processes allows the systematic repair of large volumes of plastic articles, achieving significant cost savings for our customers, as well as environmental advantages. We estimate that our technology will help to reduce the carbon footprint in at least 0.89 Kg CO2 per Kg of repaired plastic item.
After having successfully tested our technology on a small scale, we want to expand our Business Model internationally, starting with Europe. In fact, some customers with plants in several countries have asked us to extend our service to their plants in other countries.

19412,QUalitative Electricity STorage for Solar energy,"Lancey Energy Storage is pioneering a new era for energy storage, in which home appliances can contribute to the energy transition by storing electricity and engaging citizens. 
To fight global warming, renewable energy (RE) production is soaring, which is good news but has direct consequences on network management due to the intermittency of solar and wind power. Distributed storage can help better regulating the power grid and integrating more RE through self consumption and grid services. But few can afford it. Lancey aims at democratizing it by embarking a battery into a space heater. In France alone, 1/3 of real estate is electrically heated. Yet 1st generation electric heaters consume a lot of electricity and are highly responsible for the evening winter power peaks. Lancey has the solution to both of these issues. With its efficient heating technologies and energy management system, Lancey heater fine tunes to usersâ€™ needs while its battery charges off peak or with renewable energy surplus and discharges to prevent it from consuming power during peak hours. Total heating bill reduction can reach up to 50%. In 1,5 year of existence, Lancey has put on the market an innovative patented product rewarded by a CES Best innovation award. Yet this first version of the Lancey heater is still limited as its battery can only be used to power the heater. 
Solar QUESTâ€™s purpose is to develop the V2 of Lancey heater, able to reinject power stored in the battery into buildingsâ€™ grid to power other devices. It will unlock Lanceyâ€™s participation to grid services and make it possible to maximise PV installationsâ€™ self consumption rate in summer too. With its Danish partner Tomorrow, Lancey will showcase the CO2 emissions its offsets, better engage users on energy transition and integrate self-consumption and grid services parameters into Lanceyâ€™s management algorithms. Lancey will perform pilot demonstrations of this new product in France, Canada and Finland with key partners.",LANCEY ENERGY STORAGE
20384,Clean waterborne transport in Europe,"The FLAGSHIPS project raises the readiness of zero-emission waterborne transport to an entirely new level by demonstrating two commercially operated hydrogen fuel cell vessels. The demo vessels include a new build in France (Lyon) and a retrofit in Norway (Stavanger). The Lyon demo is a push-boat operating as a utility vessel on one of the most demanding rivers, the RhÃ´ne, while the Stavanger demo is a passenger and car ferry operating as part of the local public transport network. In the project, a total of 1.2 MW of on-board fuel cell power will be installed and both vessels will run on hydrogen produced on-site with electrolyzers powered by renewable electricity. Gaseous (Lyon) and liquid (Stavanger) hydrogen will be used in the vessels' on-board hydrogen storage. Both vessels will be approved for safety.
The project will cooperate over a broad base to complete the required safety assessment and approval for the two vessels, by applying and further developing the existing regulations and codes. The ship owners expect to maintain the ships in normal commercial operation after the 18-month demonstration period of the project and to this end, a solid support from local end-users and community has been gathered. The project will reduce the capital cost of marine fuel cell power systems significantly by leveraging knowhow from existing on-shore and marine system integration activities. European supply chains for H2 fuel and FC system technologies are strengthened by networking through the project. 
The consortium includes ten European partners, with two ship owners Norled (NO) and CFT (FR), and the maritime OEM and design companies ABB (FI), Kongsberg Maritime (NO) and LMG Marine (NO & FR). World-leading fuel cell technology is provided by Ballard Europe (DK) and vessel energy monitoring and management by Pers-EE (FR). Management and dissemination activities are provided by VTT (FI) and NCE Maritime CleanTech (NO), respectively.",Teknologian tutkimuskeskus VTT Oy
20523,Advanced biohybrid lighting and photovoltaic devices,"InOutBioLight aims to design multifunctional rubbers with enhanced mechanical, thermal, color-converting, and light-guiding features towards advanced biohybrid lighting and photovoltaic technologies. The latter are placed at the forefront of the EU efforts for low-cost production and efficient consumption of electricity, a critical issue for a sustainable development.
In this context, the use of biomolecules as functional components in lighting and photovoltaic devices is still a challenge, as they quickly denature under storage and device operation conditions. This paradigm has changed using an innovative rubber-like material, in which the biofunctionality is long preserved. As a proof-of-concept, color down-converting rubbers based on fluorescent proteins were used to design the first biohybrid white light-emitting diode (bio-HWLED). To develop a new generation of biohybrid devices, InOutBioLight will address the following critical issues, namely i) the nature of the protein-matrix stabilization, ii) how to enhance the thermal/mechanical features, iii) how to design multifunctional rubbers, iv) how to mimic natural patterns for light-guiding, and v) how to expand the technological use of the rubber approach.
To achieve these goals, InOutBioLight involves comprehensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and mechanical studies to investigate the protein-matrix interaction using new polymer matrices, additives, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, the mechanical, thermal, and light-coupling features will be enhanced using structural biocompounds and reproducing biomorphic patterns. As such, InOutBioLight offers three major advances: i) a thorough scientific basis for the rubber approach, ii) a significant thrust of the emerging bio-HWLEDs, and iii) innovative breakthroughs beyond state-of-the-art biohybrid solar cells.",FUNDACION IMDEA MATERIALES
20621,"Changing the electric-vehicle paradigm with green, long-lasting and fast recharge liquid batteries","Electric vehicles are poised to replace the high-polluting gasoline transport, driven by international policies aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, market uptake of electric cars is still low, less than 1% of automotive sales in 2016. The adoption of electric vehicles is hindered by long recharging times (on average 4 hours) and limited autonomy (max 300 km), due to performances constraints of the Li-ion batteries, the state-of-art in e-vehicles. 
After 4 years of research, BETTERY has developed NESSOX, a patented new class of batteries that allow for fast recharge of the battery and outstanding performances in terms of autonomy, size and weight.
The core technology is the patented design NESSOX, based on combining the lightness and high performances of the Li/O2 technology with the modularity of flow batteries, and a proprietary semi-solid catholyte based on a carbon nanoparticles, which assure flexibility and high performances.
NESSOX intend to introduce a new paradigm in electric vehicle transportation, by finally freeing e-drivers from the inconvenience of long recharging stops and limited duration of the battery, thus unleashing the market adoption of e-vehicles.
BETTERY plans to initially target the small vehicles market (e-bikes and e-scooters), and then move to the automotive sector. Global leaders in the automotive supply sector expressed their interest in collaborating for product development and distribution.
BETTERY is a high-tech start-up founded in 2018 by engineers and chemists with extensive experience in research, product development and project management. 
The Phase 1 project will be a launch pad for the future commercialization of the system, enabling BETTERY to validate the Nessox performances and the market opportunity in key areas, assess the processâ€™ economic performance indicators, and refine the business plan to attract the future investment needed for scaling up the production.",BETTERY SRL
20664,The first eco-friendly technology for greasy mixed plastics recycling,"Owing to their combination of unrivaled properties and low cost, plastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy. While delivering many benefits, the current plastics economy has drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. The primary problem is the high material waste rate and poor closed-loop recycling in plastics manufacturing. Today, just 14% of plastics are used for recycling. To cope this problem, the European Commission has tried to implement increasingly stringent regulations, such as reducing landfilling or incineration, by increasing the taxes for waste disposal and promoting recycling. Nevertheless, the current inefficient recycling technologies make plastics recycled uncompetitive as raw material for many plastics converters. At TUSTI. BV. (Eindhoven, Netherlands) we have developed a smart solution to overcome these barriers. EGREMPLARE high-tech recycling process is a novel process that makes recycling of mixed plastics possible, allowing to increase to 60-85% the collected plastics to be recycled. We use our proprietary cleaning process that uses a bio-based material without not generation of new waste streams and with a low energy consumption. Companies have to pay less than landfilling taxes, contributing to the achievement of objectives set by the European Commission and reducing disposal cost. Since our foundation in 2015, we have invested over 350,000 euros to develop pilots tests, the bio-based cleaner, and process improvements. Now, based on the good results of our system, we aim to speed-up the technology to introduce our solution in the plastic recycled market. This market with such growth potential (predicted to increase at 6% CAGR up to 2022 reaching â‚¬42B), could greatly benefit from our eco-friendly and low-energy solution. We aim to achieve sales of 12,000 tonnes of plastic waste collected and over 10,000 of plastics recycled in the third year of commercialization, with revenues of more than 6 Mâ‚¬ by 2023.",TUSTI
20786,Energy efficient High Performance Computing,"Qarnot computing aims to develop a flexible High Performance Computing grid able to reuse the heat emitted by calculation units for the heating purposes of houses and business premises.

Regularly, huge data centers are opened for storage or calculation of numerical data. Needs, including calculation power, are becoming increasingly important, which explains the creation and implementation of more and more of these data centers. However, the past few years have shown that these clusters are particularly energy-consuming not only because of the calculations but also because of the cooling systems.

The idea is to sale processing power on the cloud. The calculations are smartly distributed to a remote computing grid. The grid is composed of calculation units that are actually electric heaters. The heat is produced by the processors that perform the computing.

Qarnot computing sales cloud HPC on one end, and refunds  the electricity used by electric heaters on the other end. This solution allows Qarnot to build progressively a scalable computing grid avoiding the massive investments of a data center. Furthermore, there is no need to cool the infrastructure as the heat is directly used for heating purposes. Seasonality has already been taken into account by using CPU low power mode, install calculation units in strategic hosts such as schools that are closed during summer. In addition, computing power demand is seasonal, there is less jobs to perform during summer. Qarnot computing grid will be able to guarantee all year long a certain capacity, the extra power will be offered for free to universities and will be used as an adjustment variable (to meet the needs for calculation and the needs for heat).

Qarnot can therefore propose a very energy efficient cloud HPC for reasonable prices. This is one key to address the HPC market which already represents billions of euros. Qarnot will be able to propose greener cloud HPC for lower prices than the competitors.",QARNOT COMPUTING
21169,Second life of wood: technology to dissolve waste wood to get raw materials,"We have developed the BioFlex solvent process that uses unwanted waste wood as a very cheap raw-material to produce clean and high-quality inputs for the production of renewable chemicals, fuels and materials. An inexpensive process separates the main components of wood: cellulose and lignin. These can then be turned into final products such as bio-plastics, common chemicals and novel materials.
There are a variety of new value chains that are potentially created through our technology. For example, using the waste wood from a local council, cellulose can be isolated, which is hydrolysed, fermented to succinic acid and then used in paint. The lignin isolated alongside the cellulose can be turned into a drop-in biodiesel sold at the local petrol station. Similarly, sawdust from a timber mill can be fractionated, the cellulose used to produce methylcellulose as a thickener in food, the lignin turned into a bio-derived plastic.
We are diverting wood waste from going to landfill or incineration and sawdust going into pellets. The European pellets market is saturated, also with pellets imported from the Americas. The lignin and cellulose produced from these currently underused wood resources can enter new, emerging, or existing value chains.
Our competition on the waste wood disposal side is incineration, offering energy recovery in some cases but resulting in the formation of toxic ash and contributing to air pollution. For some heavily treated waste wood there are no competitors except for costly and highly undesirable landfilling which are largely viewed as problematic by both waste producers and waste managers.
The market is estimated to be EUR 40.9 billion for BioFlex products and EUR 13.4 billion of waste wood recycling. We have established a clear timeline for commercialization and signed a number of agreements with partners to make this plan feasible. We have an interdisciplinary and dedicated team to make Bioflex and its products available on the market.",CHRYSALIX TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED
21742,Innovative nanostructured PLA polymer to expand suitable uses of biodegradable packaging,"Bioplastics are an essential part of our efforts to reduce pollution and increase sustainability. Of these, the most ecoefficient bioplastic is PLA as it is biodegradable, requires 50% less energy and produces 10 times less emissions in comparison to standard thermoplastics like PET and PP. Furthermore, as it does not need to be recycled, it not only saves the energy and cost involved, but also the fact that only a fraction of the plastic produced reaches the recycling plant, the rest ending up in landfill or the sea.
However, biodegradable plastics only make up approximately 0.2% of plastics produced in 2014. This is because conventional PLA has certain technical limitations which reduce the number of marketable applications where it can be used. For example, it cannot compete with standard thermoplastic grades used in packaging applications (such as PET and PE), in terms of oxygen and water vapour barrier and thermal properties, which are the most demanded properties for packaging requirements. 
Advanced & Functional Technologies for Biocomposites S.L (ADBIOCOMPOSITES) has developed an innovative, biodegradable PLA grade named BlockPLA which has enhanced technical properties: oxygen and water vapour barrier, thermal stability, transparency and flexibility. BlockPLA solves the drawbacks that PLA currently shows for packaging applications. In addition, BlockPLA has food contact approval and requires less energy to be produced. Production costs are slightly lower than conventional PLA. Therefore, BlockPLA is a real biodegradable alternative to PET, PP and PLA for packaging applications in the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical and biomedical industry, home care packaging, cosmetics industry and others. 
ADBIOCOMPOSITES aims to use the SME instrument to scale up the production of BlockPLA and bring it to the packaging market, generating 37 new jobs and above â‚¬10 million revenues.",ADVANCED & FUNCTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOCOMPOSITES SL
22924,How and when does climate influence carbon sink activity? Multi-temporal analysis of wood formation in conifers,"Forest carbon sequestration plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. As evidenced by recent studies, tree carbon uptake is directly controlled by environmental influence on wood (xylem) formation processes. Current knowledge on how and when climate influences these processes mostly come from short-term direct (weekly xylogenesis monitoring) and long-term indirect (width and anatomy of annual tree rings) analysis of tree growth. Nevertheless these approaches, related to different scales of investigation, cannot provide a complete overview of the complex climate influence on tree carbon sequestration, when used separately. 
INTREE aims at quantitatively assess multi-temporal climate influence on tree carbon sequestration in temperate and boreal forests. The project will focus on two conifer species, Picea abies and Picea mariana, along two elevation gradients in the Alps and one latitude gradient in Canada. A novel approach, the analysis of intra-ring wood anatomy along tree-ring series, will be used to create a link between different scales of investigation. Xylogenesis monitoring, tree ring analysis, and intra-ring quantitative wood anatomy, will be innovatively used jointly to assess intra-seasonal to multi-decadal climate variation influence on xylem formation processes. This new knowledge will be used to quantify climate influence on xylem cell number, size, and wall thickness in tree rings, and therefore to assess how climate variations affect the amount of carbon annually stock in the tree stem.
INTREE will promote the integration of different expertizes, methods and scales of investigation in climate change-related research. Outcomes will provide a unique contribution to current understanding of forest carbon sequestration, and provide mechanistic information for vegetation and carbon process-based models. In conclusion, INTREE will improve the scientific knowledge necessary to develop climate change mitigation actions.",EIDGENOESSISCHE FORSCHUNGSANSTALT WSL
23338,Mix-in Organic-InOrganic Redox Events for High Energy Batteries,"The ever-increasing demand for improved electrochemical energy storage technologies has fostered intense, worldwide and interdisciplinary research over the past decade. The field of positive electrode materials remains largely dominated by transition metal compounds in which only the redox of metal cations contributes to the energy storage. The development of new materials and technologies, wherein both anions and cations display reversible, multi-electron redox, is bound to strongly impact this field. 
MOOiRÃ‰ will challenge this goal through innovative approaches on Metal Organic Compounds and Frameworks (MOC/Fs) with mix-in many-electron reversible redox of both, transition metal cations and organic ligand anions. Building on our preliminary results MOOiRÃ‰ will adopt an integrated approach. We will combine performance oriented MOC/F molecular design supported by in-operando analytical inspection tools with novel electrode engineering approaches to overcome the limitations and enable efficient electrochemical charge storage. Through this highly interdisciplinary research, MOOiRÃ‰ intends to advance the science and technology of mix-in redox MOC/Fs for next generation batteries, supercapacitors and their hybrids. 
MOOiRÃ‰ will also be a major systematic study of the fundamentals of MOC/F-based energy storage systems in view of a practical implementation. The overall impact will extend beyond the energy science community: the developed knowledge, tools and procedures will influence research and development related to porous composite materials, sorption, ion exchange and electrocatalysis. In the context of energy storage, this will be a disruptive development, enabling the use of MOC/Fs electrodes, with superior levels of performance as compared to current technology, at affordable costs and based on novel protocols.",UNIVERSITE CATHOLIQUE DE LOUVAIN
23455,Optoelectronics with Complex van der Waals Heterostructures,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted the attention of the scientific community since the discovery of graphene in 2004 (an atomically thin layer of graphite), due to the new and interesting physical phenomena found in this material. Graphene was not just a scientific breakthrough from a physical point of view, but it also opened the door to research on atomically thin materials. Nowadays, many materials with a wide range of properties (metals, semiconductors, insulators, superconductorsâ€¦) have been achieved in a 2D configuration, and still there are more to come.
The proposed project OPTOvanderWAALS aims to the fabrication and study of complex van der Waals heterostructures to study inter-layer excitonic phenomena and use these excitonic effects to fabricate ultra-high-performance optoelectronic devices. Novel intermediate layers between 2D semiconductors will be employed to automatically switch on and off photodetectors with an extraordinarily low dark current, which will be translated in an ultra-high-performance. These intermediate layers will be also used in photovoltaic cells as recombination region, allowing the recombination of unbalanced electron-hole pairs and avoiding charge build-up in the cells, resulting in an increased open-circuit voltage and, therefore, higher efficiency than state-of-the-art 2D photovoltaic cells. Besides, all of these heterostructures will be fabricated following a new procedure to align the crystal structure of different layers by second harmonic generation imaging, resulting in an optimized interaction between layers that will ultimately lead to ultra-high-performance devices in a new generation of flexible and transparent optoelectronics.",TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN
