0,654462,STEMM-CCS,Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage,"STEMM-CCS is an ambitious research and innovation project on geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage that will deliver new insights, guidelines for best practice, and tools for all phases of the CO2 storage cycle at ocean Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites. It brings together the main operator (Shell) of the worldâ€™s first commercial scale full-chain ocean demonstration CCS project (Peterhead Project) with the leading scientific and academic researchers in the field of ocean CCS. The work performed in STEMM-CCS will add value to this existing operational programme, and fill gaps in future capability by providing generically applicable definitive guides, technologies and techniques informing how to select a site for CCS operations, how to undertake a risk assessment, how best to monitor the operations, how to provide information on fluxes and quantification of any leakage; necessary for the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and to guide mitigation/remediation actions. All of this information will be used to better communicate the case for offshore CCS, with a particular focus on communities directly and indirectly impacted. During STEMM-CCS we will perform a simulated CO2 leak beneath the surface sediments at the site to be used for CCS as part of the Peterhead project. This experiment will be used to test CO2 leak detection, leak quantification, impact assessment, and mitigation/remediation decision support techniques currently at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) stage 4-5 and support their development to a higher TRL. In addition, using new geophysical approaches STEMM-CCS will develop tools to assess leakage from natural geological features (e.g. chimneys) and engineered structures such as abandoned wells. The Peterhead project will commence during the life of STEMM-CCS and so a unique aspect is the focus on a real-world ocean CCS site covering its initial phases of implementation, with direct involvement of industrial partners.",2016-03-01,2020-02-29,15918369.0,"['Storage', 'CCS']","['CCS', 'carbon capture and storage']",4,28
1,691712,ACT,Accellerating CCS technologies as a new low-carbon energy vector,"'This ERA-NET Cofund action is a transnational collaboration on CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. CCS is regarded as one of the main routes for Europe to mitigate climate change. Our initiative 'Accelerating CCS technology as a new low-carbon energy vector' (ACT) targets mainly the energy sector, but will also have benefits for energy intensive industries. The vision of ACT is to ensure that the energy sector makes a better contribution to climate protection by developing a collection of different CCS technologies ready for commercialisation. The consortium consists of 10 partners from 9 countries highly engaged to further development of CCS. The partner contribution for the first call is Euros 28.8 million. The consortium has received Letter of Support (LOS) from several important stakeholders in the CCS area in Europe.

The main objective of ACT is to facilitate the emergence of CCS by significant transnational joint calls that will stimulate close cooperation between researchers and industry in order to accelerate the deployment of CCS. During these calls the consortium will address the most relevant RD&D gaps in the CCS chain. ACT will bring researchers and CCS stakeholders from a number of countries closer together in a joint effort that will generate momentum towards deployment of CCS technology in Europa.

ACT will fund transnational R&D and innovation projects, facilitate meeting places for knowledge sharing, ensure synergies with pilots and demonstration projects, and invite to discussions with stakeholders in the CCS field. ACT will also ensure dissemination of results from ACT funded projects as part of an extensive outreach program targeting the research community, policymakers and the public in general. The result will be new knowledge which in turn will close gaps and accelerate CCS deployment.

2,673782,FLOATMAST,An Innovative Wind Resource Assessment Tension Leg Platform for combined Cup Anemometer and Lidar Reliable and Bankable Wind Measurements for Offshore Wind Parks,"The proposal is about the development of an innovative floating Tension Leg Platform (TLP) capable of conducting financeable grade wind measurements and environmental parameters measurements for offshore wind parks.  
Reliable and Bankable Wind Resource Assessment in offshore wind parks, presents a huge challenge as IEC compliant measuring devices are at the moment only provided by fixed met-masts. In addition, the areal expansion of the zones of potential development of offshore wind parks combined with the need for more measuring points within the candidate area, impose a need for redeployable, lower cost and reliable wind measuring devices. Furthermore, as offshore wind parks are getting into deeper waters, further from the shore and bigger in size, the costs are scaling up too and need better wind resource assessment to mitigate this and drive down the costs per kWh. Finally, financial competition between potential offshore wind parks raises up the question of reliability of the data measurements in order to lower the income risks for lenders. The solution to the above issues can be provided by the FloatMast innovative combination of three industries: Onshore Wind, Naval and Oil and Gas. On the deck of a small TLP which is a standard and proven technology in the Oil & Gas Industry, a met mast and a Lidar are fixed. This provides the ability to transfer the Onshore Wind Measurement methodology of short met mast and Lidar to produce IEC 61100 wind measurements. In addition, integration of environmental sensors (green and blue) on the platform will provide the environmental monitoring data that are useful for both the pre-construction consenting phase and the operational phase of the wind parks, thus fulfilling the environmental permit. The platform will provide a solution much needed to the Offshore Wind Industry Developers not only in the European Area, which is at the forefront of offshore wind developments but also to the markets of North America and Asia.",2015-06-01,2015-11-30,50000.0,['Wind'],"['offshore wind', 'onshore wind']",3,24
3,794562,Small-scale CSP,Numerical and experimental analysis of a novel thermal energy storage for a small-scale concentrated solar power plant,"The biggest challenge for renewable energy sources is to match the demand with the supply. By using thermal energy storage for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, the stability, reliability, and capacity factor of the plants are improved. Conventional CSP plants typically use mirrors, which are expensive to produce, install, and maintain. Apart from that, conventional thermal storages are also expensive as these are based on molten salts, which are expensive and their handling require special materials. Based on a novel micro-structured polymer foil, Heliac, Denmark, has demonstrated cost-effectiveness of the Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plants. The primary objective of â€œSmall-scale CSPâ€ is to design a novel thermal storage for Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plants. Detailed numerical works as well as experimental demonstrations are included. The intention is to design a packed bed storage system with heat storage charging and discharging using evaporation/condensation of one or more heat transfer fluids. For the thermal storage to be designed in this project, the cost is estimated to be around 4 â‚¬/kWh which is less than half of the cost of conventional storage system using molten salt (~ 11 â‚¬/kWh). The estimated cost of electricity and heat generation from the Fresnel reflector integrated foil based CSP plant with storage (at Seville, Spain) is 38 â‚¬/MWh and 8 â‚¬/MWh, respectively. By involving research topics from different fields and collaborations with world-leading organizations from industry and academia, this is a truly inter-disciplinary and inter-sectorial project, ensuring its successful completion. In broader terms, the project will contribute to the development of cost-efficient renewable energy systems, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of the heat and power generation sector, thus helping to attain socio-economic and environmental targets in context of the EU 2020 vision.",2018-06-01,2020-05-31,212194.8,['Storage'],"['Fresnel reflector', 'energy storage', 'renewable energy', 'CSP', 'concentrated solar power', 'thermal storage']",7,22
4,698136,WITRO,Wind and Turbulence Radar for Offshore wind energy,"The project studies the use of a radar based technology to increase revenues and decrease maintenance costs of offshore wind-farms by providing a technology that help wind parks predict and adapt to the wind. Modern wind turbines are adjustable. The angels of rotors and blades can be changed. This is done by a control system optimizing production on a wind park level, or an even greater level. The wind park operator have several objectives to optimize for with the help of wind data. One is to reduce maintenance costs. Sudden wind bursts damage wind turbines, through identifying such wind bursts from a distance the wind park control system can adjust the angles of the blades to deflect the power of the wind. A second is to be able to predict energy output more accurately. This is important as wind park operators often have energy delivery contracts and are penalized if they deliver more or less than predictions. Predictions become more accurate when wind park operators have data on and understanding of the wind resources. A third objective is to harmonize all wind turbines in the park to get the highest possible stable output. This is also based on data on and understanding of the wind resources. There is substantial economic benefits to be gained through improved operation of wind parks.  The yearly cost improvements from the system in the European offshore marked alone is estimated to 275 M EURO in 2020 and over 1 000 M Euro in 2030. There is also a potentially much larger positive societal impact. Improvements in the cost-efficiency of wind will help it reach a tipping-point where it is driven forward through commercial motivations rather than government aid.

Acteno energy provides smart metering services for industrial, commercial and renewable energy applications. One of our main tasks is to gather and analyse realtime energy data and provide insight into the energy system for our customers.
As part of our innovation strategy we want to focus on the application of energy storage. Therefore, we are searching for an innovative associate in order to extend our team in the new business area of storage integration.

Energy analysts have predicted that, if a viable and cost effective technology can be delivered, the deep-water offshore wind market in Europe could meet 50% of Europeâ€™s electricity requirement by 2050. Unlike competitor technologies the simple scalable 'Starfloat' is designed for construction at existing shipbuilding facilities with restricted water depth thus opening up construction opportunities for European shipyards that are currently in decline. The innovative floating foundation design and assembly process takes significant cost out of the CAPEX of deep water floating offshore wind projects and removes the need for risky offshore marine operations. 'Starfloat' therefore has the potential to be disruptive to the current perceived limitations of the offshore wind industry by bring floating offshore wind into the same levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as fixed foundation offshore wind. This will allow the project financing of deeper water wind farm sites, where the wind resource is stronger and more reliable, to be exploited using relatively low risk technology with the end result of reducing carbon emissions and reduced dependency for Europe on imported fuels. It also has the benefit of bringing steel fabrication work to declining shipyards and assembly work to deep-water offshore construction sites that are currently seeing a sharp decline in activity with the fall in the oil price and the collapse of the new shipbuilding market.'",2017-02-01,2017-09-30,50000.0,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,19

17,793316,OFFSHORE TALL TOWER,Structural safety improvement of offshore tall wind turbines under wind and wave loadings,"Wind energy has rapidly developed as a clean and renewable energy source in recent years in order to meet the increasing demand for power. The European Union has already installed over 50GW of wind power generating capacity and has planned to increase the use of wind energy in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the year 2020 (Tabassum et al., 2014). The use of wind turbines is nowadays the principal technology for generating electrical power from wind, and therefore wind energy converters need to be thoroughly investigated with respect to their capacity, effectiveness and integrity. It is widely known that wind energy potential (greater wind speeds) is greater in higher atmospheric levels, where wind flow is smooth enough as is far from the disturbed built environment. Therefore, higher towers are needed in engineering practice as the technology develops. The space used for offshore wind farms is also more flexible than that on land. For offshore wind turbines, their environmental loads are more complex than onshore ones including higher average wind velocity and wave loadings. Thus, this makes the development of a new tall offshore tower configuration imperative for the construction of offshore structures under wind and wave loadings.",2019-02-14,2021-02-13,183454.8,['Wind'],"['offshore wind', 'renewable energy']",3,16
18,835901,EDOWE,Economical Deep Offshore Wind Exploitation,"Offshore wind has long been identified as one of the most promising energy forms to improve the penetration of renewables in the European energy mix. Since most of offshore wind resources is available over deep waters at a considerable distance from the shore, it is inevitable that the campaign of the offshore wind exploitation would move from shallow waters to deep waters. As the conventional bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine is no longer economically viable over deep waters (>50m), the floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) seems to be an appealing alternative to harvest the ampler deep-water wind. FOWTs are, however, threaten by the hostile deep offshore environment, which would induce unacceptable tilt motions and drastic vibrations of the floating system. The undesirable loadings on the blades, tower, floating foundations and other components, results in mechanical failures and electrical faults of FOWTs, both of which could lead to operation interruptions and cause disastrous economic losses. Overcoming the difficulties of effectiveness, robustness, integration and multi-scalability of optimal control and fault diagnosis system of the FOWTs is precisely the topic of the proposal, which would actively contribute to the implementation of the Economical Deep Offshore Wind Exploitation (EDOWE) by introducing the concept of an innovative distributed multi-scale control and monitoring system. Delft University of Technology owns top-level expertise in wind turbine/farm control and distributed multi-scale applications. Its world-leading experimental facilities provide a solid foundation for hosting a systematic study on the control and monitoring strategies of the FOWTs. Moreover, secondment at Politecnico di Milano and collaborating with our industrial partner 2B Energy on the action help developing an advanced solution to economically harvest deep offshore wind, and thus contributing to achieve the renewables consumption goal set by European Union.",2019-10-01,2021-09-30,175572.48,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,16

Supporting the coordination of diverse stakeholders - including the private and public sectors and civil society - will contribute to a common agreement on the role that CCS technologies can play in the continued transformation of the European Union (EU) to a low-carbon economy. This will enable stakeholders to contribute effectively towards the SET-Plan activities and strategy.

The project will build on the existing European Technology Platform (ETP) for CCS, the Zero Emission Platform (ZEP), which was established in 2005 with 3 main goals:

24,816706,EOLI FPS,Roof top wind turbine for urban areas,"High electricity prices and the lowering costs of renewable technologies and energy storage are leading European energy consumers towards a distributed generation and self-consumption model. Electricity consumers are progressively turning into prosumers (producers & consumers) who decide at a given moment whether to buy electricity from the grid, to self-consume or even to export it to the grid. Moreover, European energy regulations require EU consumers to commit to clean and energy efficient objectives. For instance, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires all new buildings to be nearly zero-energy (NZEB) by the end of 2020 by reducing energy consumption and using renewable sources and all new public buildings to be NZEB by 2018. The most extended renewable energy in the world is wind power. However, wind power is not very common in urban areas where high speed laminar wind turns into a low speed turbulent one due to the existence of obstacles (buildings, houses, trees, structures, etc.). Traditional wind power turbines are not designed to work with low speed wind (2 m/s â€“ 6m/s) and turbulent wind flows. Besides, traditional SWTs entail other serious problems such as the hazard of rotating machinery, vibrations, noise, the possibility of collapse atop buildings, blade shedding and visual impact. EOLI FPS is a patented rooftop vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) specifically designed to work under low speed and turbulent wind profiles such as the existing in urban environments. EOLIS FPS works perfectly with horizontal laminar wind but also take advantage of turbulent flows that adversely affect traditional wind turbines. Its internal rotor design facilitates the creation of vortexes out of the wind turbulence that drastically increases the driving force of the laminar wind.

In this context, GENIORS addresses research and innovation in fuel cycle chemistry and physics for the optimisation of fuel design in line with the strategic research and innovation agenda and deployment strategy of SNETP, notably of its ESNII component. GENIORS focuses on reprocessing and fuel manufacture of MOX fuel potentially containing minor actinides, which would be reference fuel for the ASTRID and ALFREDO demonstrators.
More specifically, GENIORS will carry out research and innovation for developing compatible techniques for dissolution, reprocessing and manufacturing of innovative oxide fuels, potentially containing minor actinides, in a â€œfuel to fuelâ€ approach taking into account safety issues under normal and mal-operation. It also considers the impacts of these strategies on the interim storage. For delivering a full picture of a MOX fuel cycle, GENIORS will work in close collaboration with the INSPYRE project on oxide fuels performance.
By implementing a three step approach (reinforcement of the scientific knowledge => process development and testing => system studies, safety and integration), GENIORS will lead to the provision of more science-based strategies for nuclear fuel management in the EU.
It will allow nuclear energy to contribute significantly to EU energy independence. In the longer term, it will facilitate the management of ultimate radioactive waste by reducing its volume and radio-toxicity.

Onshore storage offers increased flexibility and reduced infrastructure and monitoring costs. Enabling onshore storage will support management of decarbonisation strategies at territory level while enhancing security of energy supply and local economic activities, and securing jobs across Europe. However, successful onshore storage also requires some unique technical and societal challenges to be overcome.

33,798033,HSS-Wind,Application of high-strength steel in offshore wind energy tubular structures,"Currently, offshore wind structures are constructed using normal strength steel members with yield strength of around 355 MPa. Larger section sizes are required to resist the higher load levels encountered in progressively deeper waters. This substantially increases cost, complicates logistics, generates installation difficulties, and causes greater environmental impacts. HSS material has the twin advantages of reducing the self-weight of structures and accruing associated cost savings. The installation costs typically represent up to 20% of the capital expenditure of an offshore wind farm. There is a need for more compact and lighter structures that can be easily sited on the seabed by standard installation vessels with lower crane capacity. Furthermore, the use of HSS provides increased structural resilience against strong cyclic loading in deep water environments, and reduces welding time due to reduced wall thickness. The benefit of HSS in static loading capacity is obvious, due to its increased strength. But there is a concern on deformation capacity for HSS connection, due to its lower ductility than normal-strength steel. In addition, the fatigue strength of HSS, especially at welded connections, remains an open question. HSS-WIND will investigate the application of HSS in offshore wind tubular platforms. The tubular joint is a common structural element in offshore wind platforms, and severe cyclic load, induced by wave and wind in the harsh offshore environment, may lead to fatigue fracture and failure at the vicinity of the welds.

It follows on from the first DemoWind initiative that launched in 2014 and, like its predecessor, is focussed on enabling industry, through partnership, to push technologies through TRLs 5-6 to 6-7 in transnationally funded projects.  We aim to connect existing and new European offshore wind demonstration opportunities, exchange knowledge and facilitate the acceleration of cost reducing innovative technologies to commercialisation.
This action will contribute to European cost reduction targets for offshore wind, economic development of the European offshore wind sector and help to maintain the EUâ€™s internationally leading position in offshore wind.  Reducing technology cost is essential to increasing the deployment of offshore wind, making a significant contribution to the EUâ€™s climate change targets, replacing aging fossil burning power plants with affordable energy. 

The main objectives of the DemoWind  2 project are split into two parts:
â€¢Part A is dedicated to activities related to the main co-funded Call (Work Packages 1-5)
â€¢Part B is dedicated to additional activities (Work Packages 6-7), which will be aimed at widening the dissemination of technologies supported by DemoWind 2 and at identifying and taking forward further opportunities for the DemoWind 2 partners and others to fund further RD&D activities targeting cost reduction in offshore wind without Commission funding. Initially, these additional activities will involve DemoWind 2 strengthening links with existing OSW industry groups looking at innovation and cost reduction, specifically  the OWA Europe programme.",2016-01-01,2020-12-31,8557864.92,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,14

For this purpose, the main European countries and regions, with roles to play in the future CSP deployment (industrial or academic stakeholders), have committed their economic resources to create big-scale funding synergies able to finance strategic CSP research.

CSP ERANET aims to coordinate the efforts of Member States, Associated Countries and Regions towards achieving CSP SET Plan objectives, by pooling their financial resources to implement joint calls for R&I proposals, resulting on strategic projects with substantial volumes of investment, which cannot be allocated by individual countries or by the European Commission on their own.

By pooling funds, CSP ERANET will achieve to finance large-scale projects implementing medium/high TRL research, which will accelerate the time to commercial deployment of affordable, cost-effective and resource-efficient CSP technology solutions.

CSP ERANET constitutes a public-public partnership gathering 11 representatives from Member States, Associated Countries and Regions which have committed more than 9 million EUR public fund for launching the Cofund joint calls for proposals and more than 6 million EUR for the additional call to finance transnational research actions.
During the 5 years of CSP ERANET the consortium intends to pool together financial resources from multiple countries, the Commission and the private sector, in order to invest more than 36 million euros (Cofund \ Additional Call) in researching for innovative CSP solutions.

A traditional spectrum integration PV-TE unit, by coupling the equal sized TE and PV modules, can harvest 30% more electricity than the PV unit alone. However, the pair-arrangement between the PV and TE modules appears to be economically unfeasible, owing to the significantly higher cost and lower power output of the TE module. By introducing a low cost and high efficiency micro-channel heat pipe (MCHP) and placing the PV onto the evaporator of the MCHP and TE underneath its condenser, the systemâ€™s cost will be significantly reduced while its power output remains almost same as to the pair-arranged PV-TE system. The proposed MSCA programme aims to characterise and optimise the novel PV-TE-MCHP, by integrating the excellence of the host applicant in PV and MCHP and the expertise of the researcher applicant in TE, solar energy and heat transfer technology, and by sharing the knowledge of both the host and researcher applicants in PV/T and computer simulation. The tasks involved include (a) conceptual design; (b) computer modelling/optimisation; (c) prototype construction & testing; and (d) economic and environmental performance analyses. As a result, the programme will deliver a novel PV-TE-MCHP prototype that, compared to the existing PV-TE systems, has a significantly lower cost while the electrical output remains the same. From the MSCA point of view, the project will attract an experienced researcher with particular knowledge in PV/T, TE and computer simulation into Europe. This will (a) achieve transfer of knowledge from outside into Europe, thus helping growing EUâ€™s knowledge-based economy and society; (b) develop a long term contact network among the researcher, host organisation, partner organisation and other associated institutions; and (c) enable advanced training to the researcher.",2017-10-01,2019-09-30,195454.8,,['PV'],1,14

This requires the acceleration of development of new options that are emerging today, particularly, technologies that solve the key issue of energy storage. 
The next-CSP Project is a response to this need and addresses significant improvements in all three elements targeted by the LCE-07-2016 call related to concentrated solar power: heat transfer fluids, which can be used for direct thermal energy storage; the solar field; and high temperature receivers allowing for new cycles. The proposed fluidized particle-in-tube concept is a breakthrough innovation that opens the route to the development of a new generation of CSP plants allowing high efficiency new cycles (50% and more) and 20% improvement of CSP plant efficiency. 
The Next-CSP technology that cumulates the know-how acquired during the CSP2 FP7 EU project on the particle-in-tube technology can be rapidly cost-competitive and introduced in the market. A cost reduction by 38% is expected with respect to current CSP electricity cost. 
The project will demonstrate at industrial pilot scale (TRL5) the validity of the particle-in-tube concept atop the Themis facility solar tower. A 4-MWth tubular solar receiver able to heat particles up to 800Â°C will be constructed and tested as well as the rest of the loop: a two-tank particle heat storage and a particle-to-pressurized air heat exchanger coupled to a 1.2 MWel gas turbine.

Combination and optimization of multi-energy generation, storage and consumption of local renewable energy (electricity and heat) brings new sources of flexibility to the grid and giving options for tradability and economic benefits, enabling reliable operation with a positive business case in Europeâ€™s building stock. SCORES optimizes self-consumption of renewable energy and defers investments in the energy grid. 
The SCORES concept is to develop several key-technologies in parallel, ie. second-life Li-ion batteries, compact thermal storage by Phase-Change Materials, high performance hot-water heat pump supplied by hybrid photovoltaic and solar collectors (PVT), Chemical Looping Combustion heat storage (seasonal storage), integrated through a smart Building Energy Management System (BEMS), and to demonstrate them together in a hybrid energy system. Full-scale demonstration will be done with regulatory/normative, economic and market boundaries taken into account. Demonstration of the integrated hybrid energy system will take place in two real buildings representative of different climate and energy system configurations for 3 cases, in Northern Europe with and without a heat grid, and in Middle/Southern Europe without a heat grid.

The electrolyser will be based on PEM technology and will be integrated with the wind farm, hydrogen storage and a smaller fuel cell for re-electrification.
To maximise relevance to wind farms across the EU and the world, the plant will be operated in multiple emulated configurations (energy storage, mini-grid, fuel production).
Like many large wind farms, especially offshore, Raggovidda is difficult to access, in particular in winter: Haeolus will therefore deploy a remote monitoring and control system allowing the system to operate without personnel on site.
Maintenance requirements will be minimised by a specially developed diagnostic and prognostic system for the electrolyser and BoP systems.

The containerised electrolyser is a standard model carried by project partner Hydrogenics. The integrated system will be housed in a specially erected hall to protect it from the Arctic winter and allow year-round access. The integrated system of electrolyser, fuel cells, and wind farm will be designed for flexibility in demonstration, to allow emulating different operating modes and grid services.

Haeolus answers the AWP's challenge with the widest possible project scope, with operation modes not limited to the site's particular needs but extended to all major use cases, and several in-depth analyses (released as public reports) on the business case of electrolysers in wind farms, their impact on energy systems and the environment, and their applicability in a wide range of conditions.",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,4997738.63,"['Storage', 'Wind', 'Fuel']","['energy storage', 'fuel cell']",5,13

The EU has set itself targets for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions progressively up to 2050. A popular proposed solution to this crucial problem is carbon capture and storage (CCS). Ophiolitic rocks are considered among the most promising lithotypes for CO2 storage due to their high reactivity and many exposures in the world. In this proposal, an innovative and sustainable method for ex situ mineral carbonation will be suggested that will ensure the safe storage of CO2. This method includes the creation of novel nanomaterials via the ball milling process, based on low-cost ultramafic and mafic rocks from the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus), which is considered as the most complete ophiolite worldwide. Although numerous studies have been carried out on the petrogenetic evolution of the Troodos ophiolite, a systematic work about the applicability of these rocks for CCS will be done for the first time in this study. Fines and waste material from quarries in the wider Troodos area will also be used for the development of nanomaterials. It is anticipated that ball milling will accelerate the kinetics of rock-fluid reactions during the carbonation procedure. Hence, carbonate minerals, which are stable over geological timescales, will provide a safe long term CCS solution. Additives will also be tested in the nanomaterials in an attempt to increase their CO2-storage capacity. The proposal also involves applied research in the form of exploitation of the end-product carbonates in the building industry.

controversial in many communities â€“ they are noisy, visually distracting and they vibrate. An obvious disadvantage of wind
(eolic) technology is that power generation diminishes when there is no wind. State-of-the-art eolic technologies do not work
well in urban environments, which experience vertical and turbulent wind conditions. Solar PV systemsâ€™ main disadvantage
is that energy generation peaks during the day while consumption peaks at night, increasing the need for expensive
electricity storage (batteries).
The core innovation of Omniflow is our patented omnidirectional wind turbine. By integrating Omniflow with both new and
existing photovoltaic (PV) solar energy systems we can offset non-linear solar PV electricity generation and weak eolic
microgeneration throughout the day and throughout the year in different meteorological conditions (currently up to 8.8 kW,
with PV). Thanks to its design, Omniflow works well in urban environments. There is no visible motion, and it is fully
operational both on and off the electrical grid. The applications and target markets range from distributed energy to novel,
autonomous telecommunication base stations and intelligent lighting, in urban, rural and crisis-management environments in
the EU/worldwide, and has a TRL 6-7, depending on the application.

However, there are two main obstacles to successful mass commercialisation: high manufacturing cost and insufficient life-time.
Elcogen's SOFCs have best-in-class electrical efficiency of 74%, their lower operating temperature allows lower cost (up to 76%) fuel cell systems to be produced by CHP system manufacturers. They are fully validated for standard manufacturing techniques, are fully tested by customers and approved as the best performing.  
Over the last 5 years Elcogen has developed the market for CHP (combined heat and power) and has now received purchase commitments from several customers. It has signed agreements with three key CHP Sumitomo Precision Products and LOIâ€™s from SolidPower (Italy) and Convion (Finland). They are now waiting for large volume deliveries from Elcogen. Manufacturing scale up is a top priority now. Elcogen needs to plan the manufacturing plant scale-up with initial capacity of 2m cells p.a., envisaging revenues of â‚¬57m and EBITDA of â‚¬36m in 2023. 
The feasibility of the deployment of standard manufacturing equipment has been established during a Phase 1 study. It will be possible to reduce cell manufacturing cost by nearly 90% to â‚¬5 by 2021, compared with â‚¬40 for the current 2nd generation.
Elcogen will deploy a cost-effective method for mass production of SOFCs, cutting fuel cell system costs by 65% compared with current system costs.

Small-scale residential battery storage systems are currently experiencing spectacular growth allowing households and businesses to store the excess power from own renewable sources (e.g. solar panels) and raise their self-consumption rate.
But, their potential to provide capacities for balancing power in the electricity grid is far from being fully deployed. As standalone solutions they are constrained to shift loads from a single renewable power source for a single consumer unit.

By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.
The intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.
The Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.
The CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.
CryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.",2016-04-01,2020-09-30,7045594.38,['Storage'],"['energy storage', 'renewable energy']",3,13

Furthermore, this AGRAL cermet enables Aluminium Pechiney, leader of this project, to consider the replacement of their current carbon anode by this inert anode thus decreasing to zero the CO2 emission during electrolysis process. Furthermore this AGRAL cermet will be tested for two applications: aluminium electrolysis (for the manufacturing of an inert anode up to industrial scale) and for protection of interconnect plates in hydrogen and fuel cell application (up to pre-prototype scale). This AGRAL cermet will be used as an inert anode in the Aluminium industry. Thanks to the inert anode, it is expected to decrease by a minimum of 50% of CO2 emissions compared to currently used carbon anode. Then, the transfer to the fuel and hydrogen cell applications will be studied.

Yet, current technologies limit offshore wind deployment to shallow water depth (less than 40m) restricting the market potential to a few countries (mainly the North Sea), while the vast majority and the best wind resources are located in deep waters. The installation of wind turbines on floating foundations inevitably appears as the future of offshore wind. Floating foundation solutions unleashes the market potential with no restriction on the water depth or on the seabed soil conditions, allowing developing projects further offshore where wind is stronger and the visual impact is limited.
IDEOL, a French SME created in 2010, has emerged as one of the few international leaders in floating wind, with two demonstrators built in France and Japan, relying on its patented floating platform technology, the most cost competitive solution in the market. Its team, composed by more than 40 engineers, is globally recognized as one of the best technical team with a unique know-how and innovative approach. IDEOL is already engaged in different pre-commercial and commercial projects in France, Japan and California. It is the only European technology provider and the only foreign company having convinced the Japanese government and experts.
Its technology is characterized by its extreme compactness and simplicity, its compatibility with the existing and the future extra-large wind turbines without modification, its construction either in concrete or in steel.
LEADFLOAT aims to impose IDEOLâ€™s solution as the market leader of floating wind by keeping its cost competitiveness advantage, leveraging on its demonstratorsâ€™ return of experience and securing early market share in key markets.

However, with renewable energy it is difficult to generate the same quantities of electricity that those produced by traditional fossil fuel generators and it is difficult to guarantee the reliability of supply because of the fact that the production relies on the weather for its source of power, solar collectors need clear skies and sunshine to receive photons and produce electricity, and wind turbines need wind to turn the blades. That is why energy storage is considered to be one of the primary means by which renewable energies can entirely replace fossil fuels. Traditionally, the energy is stored in an electrochemical way but batteries have some associated disadvantages. SONOLIS, an enterprise founded in late 2009 by a group of engineers and entrepreneurs, has developed an innovative Energy Storage System that combines, optimizes and improves the characteristics and performance of two basic technologies available on the market today, super capacitors and the last generation of lithium batteries, which is useful for several applications.

However, the use of these less predictable intermittent renewable technologies can lead to grid instability. As more renewables are connected to the system in line with EU legislation, this will become a critical problem throughout the EU. Grid scale energy storage technologies which can be used to store excess power for times of low generation can mitigate the problem, ensuring a balanced supply of power and utilisation the maximum renewable energy generation capacity.
The project will leverage two existing energy storage pilot sites to demonstrate the performance of a European manufactured adaptive-flywheel on the Irish and UK transmission grids. During the project, Schwungrad Energie, Adaptive Balancing Power, University of Sheffield and Freqcon will develop an adaptive flywheel battery hybrid energy storage system for dynamic grid stabilisation for initial deployment within both test grid systems prior to EU commercialisation. The demonstration of its functionality in both grids increases the technology readiness level (TRL) of the adaptive flywheel battery hybrid energy storage system from TRL 6 to TRL 8, which allows commercial application and is a requirement for scaling up of the technology post project.

SPIRE has no loses compared to a 1 axis PV Plant, and converts into thermal energy (using a Tower-CSP-TES system) the heat that today overheats PV cells. 
The thermal energy generated can then be used for several applications. Main and most immediate is the use of thermal energy storage (TES) as reliable and cost effective alternative to batteries for PV Plants. But many other uses of this smart combination of electricity and heat can be addressed: desalination, industrial process heat, agriculture, city heating/cooling, etc. SPIRE is completely zero CO2 emissions, suitable for off-grid solutions, no need of fuel supply, scalable and adaptable to some other technologies. SPIRE customized filter designs can be adapted to every location, particular light spectrum and dedicated applications and operation modes.
Moving to performance and economical parameters, SPIRE beats all: better utilization of solar spectrum which leads to higher plan efficiencies, better operational performance of the solar field (no dumped energy due to overloading of TES\turbine capacity, utilization of diffuse radiation increasing the solar resource), less land footprint per installed power,  more  competitive  prices  than  PV  \  batteries, bankable solution for 25-30 years of expected lifetime of the power plant , no degradation as silver mirrors (filters are made of inorganic oxides), less attenuation than current CSP towers, scalable with no need of billionaire investments to get good solar dispatchable energy prices, economic-quick start turbine that allows quick response to power shortage due to clouds, etc.",2019-02-01,2019-07-31,50000.0,"['Storage', 'Fuel']","['energy storage', 'CSP', 'PV']",5,12

This makes urban waste management increasingly challenging, both in terms of logistics and environmental or health impacts. To decrease the citiesâ€™ environmental impacts and to contribute to a better resilience of urban areas towards energy or food supply crisis, waste management systems have to be improved to increase recycling of resources and local valorization. In this context, the DECISIVE project proposes to change the present urban metabolism for organic matter (foods, plants, etc.), energy and biowaste to a more circular economy and to assess the impacts of these changes on the whole waste management cycle. Thus, the challenge will be to shift from a urban â€œgrey boxâ€, implying mainly goods importation and extra-urban waste management, to a cooperative organization of intra- and peri-urban networks enabling circular local and decentralised valorization of biowaste, through energy and bioproducts production. Such a new waste management paradigm is expected to increase the sustainability of urban development by: (1) promoting citizens awareness about waste costs and values; (2) promoting renewable energy production and use in the city; (3) developing an industrial ecology approach that can promote the integration between urban and peri-urban areas, by providing valuable agronomic by-products for urban agriculture development  and so improving the balance of organic products and waste in the city; (4) developing new business opportunities and jobs. In order to achieve these objectives, the project DECISIVE will develop and demonstrate, at real scale, eco-innovative solutions addressed to waste operators and public services, consisting in: (1) a decision support tool to plan, design and assess efficient decentralised management networks for biowaste in urban areas; (2) eco-designed solid-state fermentation processes.

Indeed, it is predicted that the global wind power capacity at 318 GW at the end of 2013, to reach 618 GW by the end of 2020. However, despite the growth potential, the wind energy sector faces several challenges that might endanger its long term sustainability. These challenges refer mainly to the industry competitiveness, which is increasingly affected by the price reduction of other energy alternatives, and because the most profitable (windiest) places are already occupied, the available free space is less profitable in terms of bulk energy generation, as well as a progressive reduction in government level subsidies (example in UK and Spain). This results in a strong price sensitivity for the wind energy sector, for which the only alternative goes through a significant reduction of bulk power costs. Considering that the price of wind turbines accounts for more than 80% of the total costs of a wind farm (2M-4Mâ‚¬/turbine), it is clear that reducing wind turbines prices is the only meaningful solution for the long term sustainability of the sector. 3D-COMPETE will provide the wind energy sector with a low cost solution for manufacturing the complex and heavy structural parts of wind blades. The proposed innovation is the use of an additive manufacturing process, automated fibre placement (AFP), which will enable the automation of the process. Our solution will reduce the manufacturing costs of these components by 40% (from 4,000â‚¬/ton down to 2,400â‚¬/ton). As for understanding the business opportunity, 3D-COMPETE solution will bring our customer (wind blade manufacturers) savings that can range â‚¬3.5M/year (for smaller clients that produce ~400 wind blades/year) up to â‚¬26M (for larger clients that produce ~3,000 blades/year).",2017-02-01,2017-05-31,50000.0,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,12

The project will accelerate diesel locomotive market transition from oil based diesel fuel to cheaper, cleaner and much more sustainable alternative and bio fuel - methane either in form of Liquefied (LNG) or Compressed (CNG) methane. Switching the fuel enables locomotive sector to strengthen the advantage railroads hold over trucks in long-haul shipping, comply with tougher environmental and exhaust standards and decrease fuel costs in the same time.
In recent years methane is getting a high attention from transport companies, investors, and government in rail sector with US leading the market development. Opportunity is being seized by GE, CAT, EMD and few smaller companies by piloting and testing their dual fuel products. EU is clearly lagging the rest of the world in the adoption of methane as the next gen fuel for locomotive applications. Being European company DiGas is bringing to market dual fuel product dedicated for locomotive sector out competing all similar products on a global scale. With todayâ€™s average cost of locomotive dual fuel retrofit  500k EUR, the proprietary game changing innovation enables multiple times decrease of locomotive retrofit costs combined with high diesel fuel substitution rate (60-80%) of the system allowing for commercially attractive payback periods (4 y for shunter and 2 y for main-lines) for rail operators.
In project Phase 1 DiGas strives to investigate project risks and potential hurdles of the product commercialization kick-off in Phase 2, for example certification and homologation routes, rail rolling stock and customer for various countries as well as commercialization path for various markets delivering a solid business plan.

The COREWIND project aims to achieve significant cost reductions and enhance performance of floating wind technology through the research and optimization of mooring and anchoring systems and dynamic cables. These enhancements arisen within the project will be validated by means of simulations and experimental testing both in the wave basin tanks and the wind tunnel by taking as reference two concrete-based floater concepts (semi-submersible and spar) supporting large wind turbines (15 MW), installed at water depths greater than 40 m and 90 m for the semi-submersible and spar concept, respectively. Special focus is given to develop and validate innovative solutions to improve installation techniques and operation and maintenance (O&M) activities. They will prove the benefits of concrete structures to substantially reduce the LCOE by  at least15% compared to the baseline case of bottom-fixed offshore wind, both in terms of CAPEX and OPEX. Additionally, the project will provide guidelines and best design practices, as well as open data models to accelerate the further development of concrete-based semi-submersible and spar FOWTs, based on findings from innovative cost-effective and reliable solutions for the aforementioned key aspects. It is aimed that the resulting recommendations will facilitate the cost-competitiveness of floating offshore wind energy, reducing risks and uncertainties and contributing to lower LCOE estimates.

The primary research aim is to develop a sustainable WES for a variety of EU needs. There are a number of detailed scientific and technical issues that will be addressed by the project starting from identifying the wind energy potential (off-shore and on-shore, including the built environment) to the design of a sustainable and highly efficient WES. Also the new challenging load conditions imposed on wind farms located on places where existing type of wind turbine towers are not suitable require the development of new type of support structures for wind energy converters. This fosters new structural concepts taking advantage of high performance materials e.g. high strength steel and novel maintenance free fasteners. In addition, while most research efforts and practical applications of wind energy have focused on large-scale wind installations in remote offshore or onshore areas, much less attention has been given to wind energy installations near buildings. The project has a major training aim to create technical experts who will be able to lead the necessary industrial developments in the WES, and have a broad overview of a new and emerging multi-disciplinary field.

JETSCREEN will provide alternative fuel producers and, air framers and aero-engine OEMs with knowledge based screening tools. These tools will assess the compatibility of fuels with respect to the fuel system and the combustion system and will help evaluate the chances of success in an approval process. The JETSCREEN objectives are to develop a screening and optimization platform, which integrates distributed design tools and generic experiments to assess the risks and benefits of alternative fuels, and to optimize alternative fuels for a maximum energy per kilogram of fuel and a reduction of pollutants emissions. As a step prior to the lengthy and costly approval process, screening uses low cost small scale experimental and model-based testing to predict the impact of fuel on selected engine and fuel system components. The methodology is based on deriving predictive tools which capture fuel compositionâ€™s effects on properties and sub-processes which have a direct impact on the performance of the fuel system and on the performance and emissions of the combustion system. Moreover, once the sequence of models exists to derive a relationship between fuel composition and sub-system performance then the reverse direction namely optimization is possible; for targeted performance or emission reductions can then be connected to a modification in the fuel formulation. The ambition of the JETSCREEN program is to deliver, for candidate fuels, a certificate of analysis where the key results of the ASTM D4054 approval process are listed.

In order to realize the CSP potential, the efficiency of the adopted Power Conversion Units (PCUs) must grow over 50%, entailing temperature levels of the order of 1000 Â°C: promising solutions are based on Brayton thermodynamic cycles. This project stems from the observation that no existing TES option can be coupled to such PCUs and/or work at these temperatures, and aims at filling this gap. Three interrelated research objectives are proposed, to prove the feasibility and assess the potential of
1. an innovative CSP concept whereby (i) the receiver is co-located with the TES vessel, (ii)
the solar radiation is directly absorbed by the liquid storage medium, and (iii) the thermal
power is withdrawn from the TES by bubbling a gas through it, which can thus be used as
working fluid in a Brayton cycle. An efficient and simple system results, without irradiated
metal tubes, secondary fluid loops, heat exchangers, valves, nor pumps;

The solutions are best applied together, but each will also bring water and cost savings on its own, thanks to their ability to fit any kind of CSP plant; dry, wet, or hybrid cooled, existing or future ones, tailored to location and policy framework. Their application will save more than 0.5 Mâ‚¬/year of operational cost for a 50 MW CSP plant. 
Regarding competition on water resources and humanitarian issues, the social acceptance of CSP will be increased by detailed analysis of case studies and education of local population to the benefits of solar energy. 
The targeted savings of water and operation costs will increase CSPâ€™s competitiveness compared to other renewable energy and the electricity market in general, as well as its acceptance within local communities, achieving a big step forward in the SET plan goals for CSP technology by 2020.

Specifically, the project proposes to design a modular architecture with modular systems that can be scale-up to other sizes of aircrafts and UAV applications. The design methodology is complemented with safety and regulation analysis. Regarding the fuel cell technology, two high power PEM fuel cell systems of 45 kW based on metallic bipolar plates will be adapted for aircraft applications and integrated with optimized balance of plant components to obtain an enhanced 90kW fuel cell system able to propel without support of a battery the aircraft operating modes. The hydrogen storage will be based on cryogenic technology successfully applied in previous space applications in order to achieve a gravimetric index of about 15% for a hydrogen payload between 10 and 25 kg that provides an autonomy range to the demonstrator of 5-8 hours. Moreover, HEAVEN project will leverage existing drivetrain components and an aircraft demonstrator in order to achieve an overall and successful TRL6 at the end of the project. The technology developments will be enriched with economic and business assessments during the execution of the project. Thus, HEAVEN will produce estimations of a total cost of ownership for the entire life cycle of the technology and business plan for the deployment of the technology in different aeronautics applications.

Special emphasis is placed on air filtration and development of hydrogen ejector solutions, for both efficiency and durability reasons. In addition, full scale freeze start testing of the system will be conducted.

When research vessels are performing measurements, the main engines are turned off to minimize noise, vibration and air pollution causing disturbance in the measurements. The 165 kW (2 x 82.5 kW AC) fuel cell powertrain (hybridized with a battery) will provide power to the vessel's electrical equipment as well as the dynamic positioning during measurements, free from vibration, noise and air pollution.

One of the major obstacles for wider implementation of fuel cells in the marine sector is the hydrogen infrastructure. To alleviate this problem, a mobile hydrogen storage container, refillable in any 350 bar hydrogen refuelling station will be developed in this project. This novel solution will increase hydrogen availability to marine sector as well as many other sectors.

The consortium of this project contains companies from the whole fuel cell value chain, from balance-of-plant components to system integrator and end user. The fuel cell system will be tested in conditions similar to arctic marine conditions before implementation to the target vessel. In addition, long-term durability testing (6 months, 4380 operating hours) of the system will be conducted at an industrial site.

The Incoming Researcher is a winner of Grand Gold Medal of Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions, Excellent Doctoral Dissertations Award of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Excellent PhD Graduate Award of the President of CAS, attributed to his original proof-of-concept study of the novel RC-PV/T technology.
The Incoming Researcher is a highly dedicated and motivated young researcher and has been stimulated to devise this novel design. Solar thermal collection and photovoltaics are the dominating technologies, however, the combined photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technology is expected to become popular due to its higher overall efficiency, more cost effective and better match with building energy demand as well. Integration of radiative cooling into a PV/T collector can further contribute to such merits by adding a night sky cooling function, so a RC-PV/T collector can produce electricity and heat during the daytime and provide cooling during the nighttime. To achieve such triple functions, the applicants have analysed and proposed the ideal spectral selective characteristics of the RC-PV/T panel, and a desirable RC-PV/T micro/nano coating as well as a RC-PV/T collector will be designed and trial-manufactured.
The project has been carefully designed to match the Incoming Researcherâ€™s profile with the strengths of the University of Nottingham in solar energy, micro/nano coating and low carbon buildings, and thus facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer and training.

The project will deploy a total of 2,650 new fuel cell microCHP units with real customers and monitor them for an extended period. This will:
- Enable fuel cell mCHP manufacturers to scale up production, using new series techniques, and increased automation. By 2018, four leading European manufacturers (Bosch, SOLIDpower, Vaillant and Viessmann) will have installed capacity for production of over 1,000 units/year (each will install over 500 units in PACE). These production lines will test the manufacturing techniques which will allow for mass market scale up and the reductions in unit cost which will come from associated economies of scale.
- Allow the deployment of new innovations in fuel cell microCHP products, which reduce unit cost by over 30%, increase stack lifetime to over 10 years (by end of the project) and improve the electrical efficiency of all units.
- Create a large dataset of the performance of the units, which will demonstrate the readiness of fuel cell mCHP as a mass market product. This will prove that fuel cell mCHP can be a leading contributor to reducing primary energy consumption and GHG emissions across Europe.
- Allow the units in the trial to be pooled in a large scale test of the concept of aggregating and controlling the output from mCHP to act as a virtual power plant. This will be achieved in a project run by EWE on a section of the German grid earmarked for smart grid trials.
- Act as the basis for an effort to standardise mCHP products in Europe, helping create a more efficient market for both installers and component suppliers.

92,641660,EWIT,EWIT: Developing an e-waste implementation toolkit to support the recycling and the secondary raw material recovery strategies in metropolitan areas in Africa,"Urbanization is on the rise in Africa and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The fast growing use of technology is creating a rising e-waste stream, for which there is limited recycling capacity. Waste management infrastructures and public awareness of the health issues is largely non-existent. Basic environmental precautions are almost absent and health and safety regulations are loosely enforced. Improvements are therefore urgently needed to combat related health issues, alleviate poverty and develop the local recycling sector.
EWIT projectâ€™s aim is to address these challenges, assisting African municipalities in the implementation of effective e-waste management systems for their communities.
The project will develop a comprehensive mapping of the baseline data of African metropolitan areas related to e-waste management, analyzing the most relevant experiences, processes and legal tools available. It will then deliver a dynamic and easy to use information and service portal to offer guidance and practical support for the design and development of e-waste collection and recycling systems.
EWIT will generate the expected impacts through 5 coordinated work packages. The working model is based on two different set of workshops, one led by â€œCitiesâ€ and the other by â€œExpertsâ€. Tools, implementation models, policies and procedures will feed a dedicated information and service platform called â€œE-waste implementation toolkitâ€. This dynamic and easy to use internet portal will be a strategic source of knowledge for decision makers at industry and local government level. Dissemination will play a key role to assure that the projectâ€™s deliverables are well understood and ready to be applied.

93,789453,HomeEnergyStorage,Cost-effective battery for storage of locally produced Photovoltaic energy at residential buildings,"Photovoltaic (PV) electricity microgeneration is becoming an increasingly profitable solution, because electricity costs for consumers are expected to rise and the PV panel prices to fall.
However, in the residential market, there is a time-shift (i.e. the duck curve) between the electricity consumption curve and the PV electricity production, with largest consumption in the morning and evening, while most PV production is during daytime. Currently, these differences are managed in the following way: during the day, excess PV electricity production is fed into the utility grid, and the producer receives a payment based on the Feed-in Tariff. At night, electricity consumption is maintained by the utility grid at normal costs. In the past decade, this system was supported by attractively high Feed-in Tariffs. However, due to very large number of PV installations the Feed-in costs for utility grids have grown exponentially and new payment models have now much lower or even zero Feed-in Tariffs for microgeneration in residential buildings, in most EU countries. Thus, there is now an economical incentive for electricity storage.
With this innovation project, we aim to pave the way for market introduction of the most cost-effective solution for storage of locally produced PV energy at residential buildings. To reach this goal, VisBlue is developing a storage system based on Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries. The ultimate value proposition for end-users is the lowest cost in terms of EUR/kWh/cycle on the market, ensuring as low as 9 years of payback time, which is significantly lower than any of the competing solutions.
Furthermore, the successful implementation of the innovation project is expected to boost the companyâ€™s growth, placing VisBlue in a strong position to generate around â‚¬25.6 million in revenue and a profit of â‚¬8.6 million over five yearsâ€™ post-project.",2017-12-01,2018-04-30,50000.0,['Storage'],"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",3,11

Therefore, there is an urgent demand for smarter and more sustainable automotive solutions. Alternative fuels for fossil fuels are the key solution. Among the alternative fuel, the hydrogen is the most affordable and environmentally friendly solution. Thereby, the improvement in the fuel cell stack is a must. 
Metatron is a leader company regarding components of alternative fuels such as pressure regulator for CNG and LNG. Currently, for the first time, hydrogen gas regulators are developing specifically for fuel cell vehicles at Metatron.  The traditional H2 pressure regulators are designed for medical or chemical applications, and they have a single architecture using diaphragm technology. The innovative MetatronÂ´s solution lies in an H2 pressure regulator designed exclusively for FCV with double stage architecture, piston technology and made of aluminium alloy which works at 700 barG. These unique features offer large mileage (up to 800 km), durability (15 years guarantee without maintenance), lightness (<1,8 kg), reliability (\/- 1 barG output pressure variation) and safety.

This means achieving more sustainable and efficient wind systems at a lower environmental impact than with traditional technologies. The innovation of MEWi-B product lies in passive aeroelastic deformation; in the innovative design of the aerodynamic profile, in the innovative and recyclable materials used; in the lighter blades; in the reduction of the rotors diameter at the same power produced.
The new blades will allow to produce wind energy in areas where to date it is not cost effective because of low wind, but also to increase the efficiency (20%) of existing wind farms through the re-blading programme. To date, it estimated around 10.000 turbines in Europe that could benefit from re-blading. The wind energy landscape is moving towards a very difficult phase due to incentive cuts for Renewable Energy System, energy wholesale price reduction and expensive system charges. All factors are determining lower than expected returns on assets in operation. As a result, most new wind projects are now being abandoned due to unattractive returns. In this contest MEWi-B provides superior quality blades which delivers over-performance valued by customers.
The potential customers are wind turbines manufacturers which will put on their market an innovative solution, owners of existing wind farms, managing company which will benefit from more efficiency and longer life-cycle by replacing the obsolete blades, and developer of new wind farms which could use also marginal sites.

Given this context, the Micro Energy Storage (MES) systems are expected to seek radically new approaches to supply energy where it is needed. Buildings are becoming a local use micro energy-hubs consuming, producing, storing, supplying energy and having the potential to take up an important role in the power-supply system stability which generate energy with renewables, provide storage for electric and thermal energy and deliver demand response.

In the offshore wind industry, newly commissioned engineering projects often experience failures either in the initial years of operation or at the end of their lifecycle. Subsea cable damage most often arises from: anchor strikes, dragging fishing nets and erosion. Statistics show that a wind farm cable circuit of average length is likely to experience 1-2 faults per 20-year period. Insurance companies increasingly report on HV cable faults being a major issue for financial losses at offshore wind farms. They led to insurance claims totaling more than â‚¬60 million in 2015. On average, at least 10 subsea cable failures are declared to insurers each year in the offshore wind sector. The financial severity of these incidents continues to grow â€“ such that they account for 77% of the total global cost of offshore wind farm losses. Our CableSENTRY is an innovative solution based on Digital Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that detects subsea cable faults in real time. Acoustic signals from the HV cable create an optical response in a fibre optic line so faults and other events can be located accurately and immediately on a calibrated system. Applied in addition to existing fault location technology, our solution will be able to identify fault locations in land and subsea HV cables and save an average of 4 daysâ€™ downtime per fault over current methods",2017-07-01,2019-06-30,1380871.0,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,11

Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) modules cannot always be placed under ideal circumstances due to restrictions arising from the building profile. Therefore, non-ideal orientation and inhomogeneous irradiation resulting from shadowing from obstacles will often create non-uniform illumination. This, in turn, creates current mismatch among the different PV modules as well as among the different cells each PV module is made of. This mismatch can cause a dramatic reduction of the overall PV module power. Since current PV module technologies, both standard and smart, are not able to efficiently and effectively face the mismatch issue in highly non-uniform applications such as BIPV, innovative PV module technologies are required. The aim of this proposal is to realize a first fully functional demonstrator of Reconfigurable Smart PV (RSPV) module, able to dynamically change the electrical interconnection between the PV cells in real-time as the PV module adapts to its environment, and to develop the integrated intelligence. Both hardware and software will be designed ad hoc in order to balance additional cost and energy harvesting in non-ideal conditions.

Total heating bill reduction can reach up to 50%. In 1,5 year of existence, Lancey has put on the market an innovative patented product rewarded by a CES Best innovation award. Yet this first version of the Lancey heater is still limited as its battery can only be used to power the heater. 
Solar QUESTâ€™s purpose is to develop the V2 of Lancey heater, able to reinject power stored in the battery into buildingsâ€™ grid to power other devices. It will unlock Lanceyâ€™s participation to grid services and make it possible to maximise PV installationsâ€™ self consumption rate in summer too. With its Danish partner Tomorrow, Lancey will showcase the CO2 emissions its offsets, better engage users on energy transition and integrate self-consumption and grid services parameters into Lanceyâ€™s management algorithms.

105,657041,GLOBE,All Organic Redox Flow Batteries,"European Union (EU) intends to significantly reduce the CO2 emissions in the following decades. To do this, the use of fossil fuels in all sectors and particularly in power sector will be continuously reduced and replaced with renewable energy sources. Such transition depends on proper electrical energy storage (EES) technology for renewable energy management in order to handle the varying solar and wind generated electricity. So far only redox flow batteries (RFB) show potential for renewable energy management because of: i) scalability between storage capacity and power; ii) short response time; iii) good cycling capability, iv) long discharge time and v) low cost potential. The use of state-of-the-art metal based RFBs is limited by their relatively high costs that inherently are linked to the low current and energy density. Recently a breakthrough in RFB technology is reported, high current densities are achieved  in a RFB based on organic-halide electrolytes. Organic-halide RFB can store electricity at almost ten times lower life cycle cost compared to metal based RFB, due to increased current density and lower electrolyte costs. One of the objectives of the current proposal is to investigate feasibility and stability of organic-halide RFB. The main goal of the fellowship is to build All Organic RFB by replacing the halide part (Br2) with less hazardous and cheap organic electrolytes which have extremely fast electrokinetics: (2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxy (TEMPO) and hydroxylated anthraquinone di-sulphonic acids.  Since latter are not commercially available, a new chemical synthesis routes will be developed. Nanoporous films and anion exchange membranes will be considered as an alternative to expensive proton conductive membrane-Nafion.

Batteries allow for a significant increase of penetration of stochastic renewable energy sources but are unable to satisfy transient events requiring high power responses. In the case of fossil fuel technologies, a set of well-known drawbacks (high operation costs, fuel dependency, pollution and power supply instability, etc.) shows that these solutions are not the most suitable ones from economic and environmental perspectives.

By 2050, the EU-28 aims to achieve CO2 emissions cuts of 80-95% compared to 1990 levels and to achieve a 20% share
for renewable energy sources in its overall energy consumption by 2020. This requires a process of 'decarbonising'
Europe's economy, including the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. Wind energy and Solar
photovoltaic (PV) energy have been the leading sources of low carbon electricity generation in EU since 2011.
The installation of wind turbines is characterized by very high construction costs that amortize slowly over the years through
the sale of electricity to the grid. The amount of energy produced depends mainly on the nominal power of the installed
generator and of the amount of wind that can be used.
INNOWIND offers cost-effective mid-power wind turbine farms, with high flexibility in terms of size and area of construction,
with low security requirements and no special construction permits required, making implementation in urban areas a
possibility. INNOWIND offers for the first time the opportunity to make use of terrain not suitable for conventional wind
farming.
Furthermore, thanks to the easy scaling of the units from 50kW to 1000kW, it is possible to cater the specific power needs in

However, the inherent volatility of most of these energy sources requires both the installation of fast fossil backup power and large amounts of storage capacity. In the ERC funded project GREENEST the fundamentals of an ultra-wet gas turbine cycle are developed. In the proposed project BlueStep :  Blue Combustion for the Storage of Green Electrical Power, the idea of ultra-wet combustion is extended towards the demonstration of a very effective and clean energy storage and conversion technology. Excess renewable electrical energy is utilized in a high pressure electrolysis process to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Both gases are stored at high pressure and their combustion, referred to as blue combustion, can be directly incorporated in existing base load steam power plants, resulting in the BlueStep cycle. Combustion takes place in the steam cycle of the plant and the exhaust gases consist solely of steam that can further expand in the remaining stages of the closed steam cycle. Depending on the mode of application, the power output of the plant and the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced significantly. The proposed BlueStep cycle outclasses competing technologies in terms of efficiency, flexibility, space requirements, and investment costs. In a highly conservative market sector the proposed technology offers an economical and efficient method to realize extensive energy storage.

This means a slow ROI for decentralised renewable energy producers due to having to still pay for energy daily. The energy market is unclear and incomprehensible with most energy consumers not enough info on their energy consumption and generation rates.
gridBox is a smart energy management system that monitors energy generation and consumption rates and produces analytics to optimise energy transfers between generators, energy storage systems and the grid. It will also inform the user of actionable tasks that can be performed to reduce energy consumption by ~30% and improve energy efficiency through the analytics algorithms. It creates increased revenues for decentralised renewable energy producers and battery storage system owners by selling excess energy back to the grid. gridBox will increase the mix of renewable energy on the grid supplying all consumers with clean energy.

To reach this goal new waste management strategies need to be applied by municipalities, not only to align with EU recycling targets but also to be able to cover increasing disposal costs. Strategies should begin by making households aware of the necessity to lower their waste generation, while increasing their recycling rate. One of the most effective ways to motivate households, is through 'Pay as you throw' (PAYT) schemes, based on the implementation of a disposal fee per household, according to the amount of waste generated. In order to be able to apply PAYT schemes, selective waste collection needs to be implemented by municipalities or waste management companies. One of the most common, is door-to-door (DtD) waste collection, as it greatly facilitates the application of PAYT schemes while promoting recycling among households. Even though, the combination of DtD collection with PAYT greatly reduces the load of waste generated, current systems to account for the amounf of waste generated per household are not accurate. They quantify based on the number of bags/bins (with a set volume) each household generates, without considering that in many occasions these bags/bins are just partially filled upon collection. Nevertheless, households are charged the same, neglecting if all the volume has been filled. A new accurate measuring system is needed.

123,687409,EASY Pv,EGNSS high Accuracy SYstem improving PhotoVoltaic plants maintenance,"EGNSS high Accuracy SYstem improving PhotoVoltaic plants maintenance.

The purpose of the EASY PV proposal is to provide a time and cost effective service as direct response to the growing need expressed by several maintainers and PV field owners to enhance the energy production of their plants.

As photovoltaic plants are aging, it is not uncommon that their production lowers due to inefficiency caused by unknown modules on the plant lowering the whole plantâ€™s productivity. Thermal inspections are valuable for PV owners and maintainers, but relevant procedures (currently performed by operators with handheld cameras) are time demanding and sometimes expensive due to safety costs for the personnel involved in the operations (e.g.: PV modules on roofs, rough areas, â€¦). It stands to reason that today such operations are not fully automated yet and the responsive recognition of a broken module might result very difficult in a large PV plant.

As a first improved solution, the growing technology of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) is exploited to gather thermic images which are geo-referenced by GPS positioning and processed by computer vision algorithms. However this configuration is very respectful but still not enough in order to provide the required positioning accuracy for the automation and fast identification of the broken modules. Only the aid of accurate positioning allows a cost effective solution to reduce time, costs and risks for personnel involved: the added value provided by the employment of GNSS high accuracy solutions as novelty in the RPAS domain is the key driver for the EASY PV turnkey solution.

Finally EASY PV solution is conceived to build up an automatic system for acquiring, georeferencing and processing both visible and thermal images captured by an RPAS equipped with a Galileo/EGNOS high accuracy receiver, flying over a photovoltaic field. In this way it is possible to easily detect the defective modules to be replaced.",2016-02-01,2018-01-31,935973.13,,"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",2,10

Heart of our call is to build a worldwide new and unique machine which allows serially* produce the centrepiece of fuel cell system: the stack.This will revolutionize the way how stacks are produced in future. 

The members of the consortium are: a developer and producer of fuel cell systems (Proton Motor Fuel Cell GmbH), a supplier of MEAs and BiPolar Plates (BPP) (EWII), a supplier of industrial machinery for assembly, handling and testing equipment (USK Karl UTZ Sondermaschinen GmbH), two renowned research institutions (Technische Universitat Chemnitz / ALF, Fraunhofer IWU) and a EU project management expert (Uniresearch B.V.) and last but not least, UPS an international transport OEM with its own vehicle production of Light Commercial Vehicles.

126,817190,CITRES,Chemistry and interface tailored lead-free relaxor thin films for energy storage capacitors,"The goal of CITRES is to provide new energy storage devices with high power and energy density by developing novel multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) based on relaxor thin films (RTF). 

Energy storage units for energy autonomous sensor systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) must possess high power and energy density to allow quick charge/recharge and long-time energy supply. Current energy storage devices cannot meet those demands: Batteries have large capacity but long charging/discharging times due to slow chemical reactions and ion diffusion. Ceramic dielectric capacitors â€“ being based on ionic and electronic polarisation mechanisms â€“ can deliver and take up power quickly, but store much less energy due to low dielectric breakdown strength (DBS), high losses, and leakage currents. 

RTF are ideal candidates: (i) Thin film processing allows obtaining low porosity and defects, thus enhancing the DBS; (ii) slim polarisation hysteresis loops, intrinsic to relaxors, allow reducing the losses. High energy density can be achieved in RTF by maximising the polarisation and minimising the leakage currents. Both aspects are controlled by the amount, type and local distribution of chemical substituents in the RTF lattice, whereas the latter depends also on the chemistry of the electrode metal. 
 
In CITRES, we will identify the influence of substituents on electric polarisation from atomic to macroscopic scale by combining multiscale atomistic modelling with advanced structural, chemical and electrical characterizations on several length scales both in the RTF bulk and at interfaces with various electrodes. This will allow for the first time the design of energy storage properties of RTF by chemical substitution and electrode selection.

The ground-breaking nature of CITRES resides in the design and realisation of RTF-based dielectric MLCCs with better energy storage performances than supercapacitors and batteries, thus enabling energy autonomy for IoT sensor systems.",2019-04-01,2024-03-31,1996519.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,10
127,640988,FLPower,Frustrated Power: Proton-Electrolyte-Membrane Hydrogen Fuel Cells Catalyzed by Frustrated Lewis Pairs,"Despite H2 fuel cell technology pre-dating the internal combustion engine the technology has not progressed much in 100 years. All hydrogen fuel cells use precious (rare and expensive) metal catalysts to oxidise H2, and reduce O2, such as Pt. These â€œpreciousâ€ metals currently prevent the widespread use of fuel cells. The US Department of Energy has set a target of 0.125g of Pt / kW energy produced from fuel cells, and a total cost of $30 /kW. The current record stands at 0.2 g Pt/kW and a cost of $36/kW. The automotive industry requires the current Pt content of fuel cells to be reduced by 1/3 to become economically viable. Pt is a major cost component and is clearly a problem. This project develops a way to reduce Pt content of fuel cells by half â€“ falling well below DoE targets and those of the automotive industry. We do this by replacing rare and expensive Pt metal used to oxidize H2 on 1 side of the fuel cell with molecular catalysts made of B, C, Cl, and F elements â€“ cheap and abundant materials!
The molecular catalysts that we have developed form â€œfrustrated Lewis pairsâ€ (FLP). A suitable Lewis acid and a Lewis base when combined form an FLP which can be used to heterolytically split H2. The resulting Lewis acid hydride is then oxidized at a carbon electrode, and the energetic driving force required to oxidise H2 into 2 H\ and 2eâ€“ is greatly reduced by as much as 610 mV (equivalent to catalyzing the reaction by 118 kJ mol-1) without using any Pt. This proposal seeks to build on this pioneering work. We have found that FLP reactions can occur at very electron deficient Lewis acids without needing a Lewis base! Instead we can use a common organic solvent, tetrahydrofuran, as the Lewis base, and form water tolerant Lewis acid catalysts, that cleave hydrogen in seconds on the same timescale as electrooxidation. This fund will allow us to develop aqueous FLP arylborane electrocatalysts and build prototype â€œfrustrated fuel cellsâ€ as clean, cheap, energy  devices.",2014-12-01,2015-11-30,149533.75,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,10
128,670116,ARPEMA,Anionic redox processes:  A transformational approach for advanced energy materials,"Redox chemistry provides the fundamental basis for numerous energy-related electrochemical devices, among which Li-ion batteries (LIB) have become the premier energy storage technology for portable electronics and vehicle electrification. Throughout its history, LIB technology has relied on cationic redox reactions as the sole source of energy storage capacity.  This is no longer true. In 2013 we demonstrated that Li-driven reversible formation of (O2)nï€­ peroxo-groups in new layered oxides led to extraordinary increases in energy storage capacity. This finding, which is receiving worldwide attention, represents a transformational approach for creating advanced energy materials for not only energy storage, but also water splitting applications as both involve peroxo species. However, as is often the case with new discoveries, the fundamental science at work needs to be rationalized and understood. Specifically, what are the mechanisms for ion and electron transport in these Li-driven anionic redox reactions?  
To address these seminal questions and to widen the spectrum of materials (transition metal and anion) showing anionic redox chemistry, we propose a comprehensive research program that combines experimental and computational methods. The experimental methods include structural and electrochemical analyses (both ex-situ and in-situ), and computational modeling will be based on first-principles DFT for identifying the fundamental processes that enable anionic redox activity. The knowledge gained from these studies, in combination with our expertise in inorganic synthesis, will enable us to design a new generation of Li-ion battery materials that exhibit substantial increases (20 -30%) in energy storage capacity, with additional impacts on the development of Na-ion batteries and the design of water splitting catalysts, with the feasibility to surpass current water splitting efficiencies via novel (O2)nï€­-based electrocatalysts.",2015-10-01,2020-09-30,2249196.25,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,10
129,811473,LEP4BLADES,Innovative Leading Edge Protection System for Wind Turbine Blades,"Wind Power has become the most promising technology as source of renewable energy in the World. In 2016, Wind Power installed more than any other form of power generation in Europe (51% of total power capacity installations), overtaking coal as the 2nd largest form of power generation capacity.
Since cost reduction of each kW/h generated by Wind Power industry is one of its strategic targets, the market displays a strong tendency towards bigger wind turbines with longer blades. However, bigger rotor diameters have raised a dramatic problem regarding the durability of the blades which concerns the whole value chain of the wind power industry. Increasing blade lengths means faster linear velocity of the tip of the blade and consequently higher erosion rate of the leading edge of the blade caused by rain, hail or suspended particles.
Although the lifespan of a wind turbine is calculated in 25 years, traditional medium sized wind turbines provided with current protection systems of the leading edges, required complete maintenance tasks due to deterioration of the blades at around year 10. However, recently installed turbines with \100 m diameter rotors showed problems regarding the erosion of the blades at year 2.
In order to solve the erosion problem, Aerox Advanced Polymers SL, a SME specialised in developing solutions for the wind power industry, has developed an innovative leading edge protection (LEP) polymeric coating with particular mechanical and chemical properties which is able to avoid the erosion problem during the whole lifetime of the wind blade.
The LEP4BLADES project aims to accelerate the commercialisation of the coating solution through the scaling-up the manufacturing and application processes, which will also require the improvement of the polymer technology and the product formulation.",2018-06-01,2020-01-31,1011622.5,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,10

In response to that, RE-COGNITION proposes a holistic, end-to-end RETs Integration Framework towards energy positive buildings with a focus on small and medium-sized buildings in Europe. Through the envisaged Automated Cognitive Energy Management Engine (ACEME), RE will be utilized more efficiently paired with appropriate storage technologies and innovative energy systems to meet the electricity and heating/cooling demand of the buildings. The framework is designed to enable the integration of multiple, heterogeneous, energy generating systems covering the spectrum of available building-scale RES (solar (PV, thermal/ cooling), wind, bio-energy (renewable biofuel through micro-CHP) and geothermal) and demonstrating future-proof extensibility. To this end, the project entails R&D at the level of single technologies and their interconnection with novel energy systems (like heat-pumps harnessing geothermal energy, absorption chillers) leveraging current IoT and smart-grid standardization outcomes. Along with measurable improvements on each technologyâ€™s efficiency, performance, desired characteristics and cost-effectiveness, RE-COGNITION ensures optimal integration of RETs in buildings, as well as (inter)operation and matching between building RE supply and energy demand. Its stakeholder-centred approach aligns both the process and its outcomes with the needs and expectations of (end-)users by providing tools that facilitate large-scale deployment of building-scale RETs.

In particular, tower systems are appealing for the great environmental compatibility and offer tremendous potential for efficient (electrical and thermal) power generation. Yet, their industrial exploitation has been so far hindered by limitations in the materials used both for the central receiver - the core component - and for thermal storage. Such limitations dictate maximum working temperature and in-service overall durability (mainly driven by failure from thermal cycling and thermal shocks).  Improving the efficiency of a tower system entails necessarily improving the central receiver upstream and possibly re-engineering the whole systems downstream to work longer and at much higher temperature, especially in the thermal storage compartment. 

NEXTOWER will address this need by taking a comprehensive conceptual and manufacturing approach that will optimize bulk and joining materials for durability at the component level to achieve 25 years of maintenance-free continued service of the receiver and maximum thermodynamic efficiency at the system level. This is made possible through a unique combination of excellence in materials design and manufacturing, CSP full-scale testing facilities brought together in the Consortium, supporting the making of a new full scale demo SOLEAD (in Turkey) within the project.

Because the sustainable kerosene emits less soot and no sulphur, it meets future aviation air pollution standards. The conversion is based on plasma driven CO2 dissociation, solid oxide membranes and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of kerosene. Synergy between plasma activated species and novel perovskite electrodes of the oxygen separator are expected to raise CO productivity and energy efficiency. CO2 emitted upon fuel usage is recirculated as feedstock to the process by direct air capture. The technology is modular, scalable and relies on inexpensive existing infrastructure for storage, transport and distribution.

139,832339,INSTABRIQ,Resource-efficient Machine for the Recycling of coal dust into High-calorie Briquettes,"Coke, a highly-calorific low-sulphur fuel obtained from bituminous coal, is vital in the production of steel by steelworks. During this process, up to 0.5 kg of coke dust/tonne of coke is expelled. The release of coke dust can present respiratory health hazards to humans, whilst accumulating in the environment due to minimal recycling, often as a consequence of the presence of metal contaminants. Un-contaminated coke dust can currently be turned into coke briquettes with the aid of binding agents or adhesives. Binding agents and adhesives, however, contribute to inefficient combustion and release of environmentally-harmful SO2 and NOx gases, which decrease the efficiency of CCS technologies (i.e. CCS technology can be up to 99 % efficient in the absence of SO2 and NOx). Thus, minimising the amounts of sulphur and nitrogen in coal can dramatically reduce the percentage of CO2 emitted into the environment. We, the C.A. Group, have developed INSTABRIQ, a new type of briquetting machine, which can compress any type of coal dust to create low-sulphur (as low as 0.65 %) â€œclean coalâ€ briquettes, without using adhesives, thus also affording a high heat capacity. INSTABRIQ briquettes have the same structural integrity as adhesive-containing solutions. As an experienced metals recycling company, we are also uniquely positioned to remove metal contaminants from coke dust, thus increasing the portion of coal, which can be recycled to produce briquettes. INSTABRIQ is a unique and value-added tool for coal-reliant industries, facilitating virgin-raw-material- and CCS-technology-efficiency. Following this project, we expect to commercialise our machine by 2021 to create briquettes primarily for reuse in the steel industry and secondarily for households.

SUNTHERMâ€™s game-changer integrated heating system for households - SmartHeat - consists of:
- Smart heating and heat storage, provided by a 25 kWh thermal battery (60 Ã— 60 Ã— 200 cm), coupled to a module of cloudbased management with an online control unit for real-time control over heat management, acting as a buffer in the grid;
- Solar thermal collectors, for higher flexibility and 100% zero-carbon, sustainable heat production;
- Heat pump, smart grid enabled, providing the management of energy loads - peak load shaving -, the storage of excess power during low demand periods for release during peak demand periods - load balancing -, and the integrated optimization of the heat pump operation.
SmartHeat can effectively cover normal family's daily needs for radiators, floor heating or hot water, with a heat release capacity above any other heating unit available, due to its intelligent and huge storage capacity - equivalent to an oil burner in a utility room and delivery of twice the amount of hot water than a conventional hot water tank. By storing energy from the sun - or when the power is cheap - in our unique battery and delivering it when the house requires heating, we will offer the homeowner the opportunity to reduce the heat bill by 75% in comparison to the use of an oil burner, due to 40% increase in efficiency vs. a stand-alone heat pump.
Through the successful development and implementation of SmartHeat WWF award winning technology, SUNTHERM will be in a strong position to exploit a market worth at 34.5 billion â‚¬ and enhance its profitability by the stream of the sales, with an expected cumulated turnover of 83 million â‚¬, 5 years after project completion.",2017-11-01,2019-10-31,1110130.0,['Storage'],"['smart grid', 'thermal storage', 'heat pump']",4,9

Thus, foundations installation, together with O&M costs, have been identified as interrelated R&D priorities for driving down offshore levelised cost of energy (LCOE) over the next 15 years. 
The SME behind the DMC GroutTube project, Drechsler Marine Consult (DMC), aims to pursue this major market opportunity by bringing its innovative equipment/concept â€“ DMC GroutTube - for offshore grouting of multi-pile foundations of wind turbines, to commercial maturity through the testing, demonstration and certification of this new grouting system. The novel technology holds a range off clear advantages compared to the traditional grouting method used today. All these benefits provide an estimated grouting cost reduction of 68% (228kâ‚¬ and 304kâ‚¬ saved per each tripod and jacket foundations installed, respectively), representing a 3.8% LCOE reduction, per offshore wind turbine installed and doubling the number of foundations grouted per day. These saving represent a major step forward to achieve the goal of 5-11% reductions in LCOE that were set for 2015, which were not yet achieved.
Overall, this project opens not only an important economic opportunity for DMC â€“ expecting over â‚¬20 million profits, 5 years post-project â€“ but will ultimately lead to a lower overall life cycle costs of offshore wind turbines, as well as reduced environmental impact of installation activities.

144,661891,SAMOFAR,A Paradigm Shift in Reactor Safety with the Molten Salt Fast Reactor,"Imagine an inherently safe reactor that produces all electricity world-wide for thousands of years, and recycles all actinides until fission.

The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) can reach this goal. The cylindrical reactor core contains actinide-fluorides mixed in lithium-fluoride. The liquid salt is at ambient pressure and can freely expand upon heating, giving a strong negative reactivity feedback. The core is in its most reactive state and any geometrical change lead to lower reactivity. In case of hypothetical accidents, the fuel salt will automatically be drained via freeze plugs into fail-safe tanks. The fuel salt is continuously cleaned and controlled in an integrated chemical plant. The MSFR can operate as a breeder reactor in the thorium fuel cycle or as a burner reactor fuelled with plutonium and minor actinides. In short: the MSFR excels in safety, sustainability and optimal waste management.
Within SAMOFAR we will perform advanced experiments to proof the key safety features:
â€¢ The freeze plug and draining of the fuel salt
â€¢ Measurement of safety-related data of the fuel salt
â€¢ New coatings to structural materials like Ni-based alloys
â€¢ The dynamics of natural circulation of (internally heated) fuel salts
â€¢ The reductive processes to extract lanthanides and actinides from the fuel salt

Furthermore, we will build a software simulator to demonstrate the operational transients, and we will show the mild responses of the MSFR to transients and accident scenarios, using new leading-edge multi-physics simulation tools including uncertainty quantification. All experimental and numerical results will be incorporated into the new reactor design, which will be subjected to a new integral safety assessment method.

The goal of SAMOFAR is to deliver indisputable evidence of the excellent safety features of the MSFR, and to enable a consortium of important stakeholders like TSOâ€™s and industry, to advance with the MSFR up to the Demonstration phase.",2015-08-01,2019-07-31,3466896.5,"['Waste management', 'Fuel']",['waste management'],3,9

The principle of BAoBaB is altering the acid-base balance by means of an excess of available electricity to obtain an acid and base from its corresponding salt solution. When electricity is needed, acid and base are recombined into their corresponding salt solution again while obtaining electrical work from the entropy and enthalpy gain. Our goal is to develop this totally new, environment-friendly, cost-competitive, scalable, water-based electrical energy storage system from TRL3 to TRL5.

Our objectives are:
1. to establish and extend the potential of BAoBaB to become a reliable and environmentally friendly way of storing (renewable) electricity at kWh-MWh scale for application at user premises or at substation level.
2. to understand and enhance mass transfer in round-trip conversion techniques and hence to improve the energy conversion efficiencies of the BAoBaB system, aiming an efficiency >80% and >10 times higher energy density than in Pumped Hydropower Storage. 
3. to validate under accepted utility use conditions an automatically operated BAoBaB system (with corresponding battery management) at a scale of 1 kW power and 7 kWh energy storage.
4. To pave the road for cost competitive energy storage with attention to life-cycle cost and performance, aiming at <0.05 â‚¬/kWh/cycle.

BAoBaB operates at a timescale of hours to days, and hence will enable a larger penetration degree of distributed and intermittent renewable energy sources.

Facing this increasing environmental challenge three industrial partners, Geltz, Variata and Revatech identified the big economic potential of raw materials contained in eol PV modules. Prior to this request for funding they have developed a patented technology to recover about 95% of silicon, high purity glass, aluminum, copper, silver, gold, tin and lead from eol modules.

The PivotBuoy system combines the advantages of Single Point Mooring systems (SPM - pre-installation of the mooring and connection system using small vessels) with those of tension-leg systems (TLPs - weight reduction, reduced mooring length and enhanced stability), enabling a radical weight reduction of 50% to 90% in floating wind systems compared to current spar and semi-submersible systems but also enabling a critical simplification in the installation of traditional TLP systems. 
The PivotBuoy concept, initially conceived by its founder while at MIT, is currently at TRL3 after the proof of concept in a wave tank at 1:64 scale and it is the result of years of experience. The project proposes validating the concept at PLOCAN test site, integrating a part-scale prototype of the PivotBuoy single point mooring system in a 225kW downwind floating platform developed by X1 WIND. By testing in a relevant environment, the project will also validate critical innovations related to assembly, installation and O&M techniques, reaching TRL5 at the project end. 
The impact of the proposed innovations is sector wide: the system can be integrated not only in X1 WIND downwind platform but in any other floating platforms using single point moorings systems in the wind and in other sectors such as wave energy, tidal and oil&gas industries. The project consortium, combining experienced industrial partners from the oil&gas, naval and offshore wind sectors with cutting-edge R&D centres, will also bring additional innovations in components, materials and installation and O&M techniques, advancing the state-of-the-art of the floating wind sector.

However, the biggest limit of such technology is the intermittency and the diurnal nature of the solar light. For their future development, CSP plants need to be coupled with storage system. Among the existing thermal storage systems, the ThermoChemical Storage (TCS) is one of the most promising technology and it is based on the exploitation of the reaction heat of a reversible chemical reaction. Just recently, perovskite systems have drawn increasing interest as promising candidates for TCS systems. Perovskites are generally indicated as ABO3, with A and B the two cations of the structure and with O the oxygen. They exhibit a continuous, quasi-linear oxygen release/uptake within a very wide temperature range. Their reduction being endothermic consists in the heat storage step, while the exothermic oxidation releases heat when it is required. The overall objective of the proposal is to study more earth abundant compositions (Ca-, Fe-, Mn- or Co-based) of perovskites for identifying one or more promising candidate storage medium for the design and the realization of a prototype of a multilevel-cascaded TCS system. It aims at solving the no-easy solution problem of the wide temperature range to be covered by a TCS system for CSP plant by using perovskites with different operating temperatures cascaded from the lowest operating temperature to the maximum one.

Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM), of which waste recycling encompasses one part, is essential on a global scale. Innovative, low-cost methods of waste recycling was developed by vulnerable and marginalized waste pickers , which have led to the creation of an informal waste recycling sector (IRS)  which are currently being used in Brazil and others LMIC, and have the potential to be more widely deployed. The IRS has developed work procedures that diverge from those deployed in EU recycling, setting a social technology (ST). This IRS ST is beneficial to ISWM, as it diminishes overall costs and amplifies quantities recovered, besides providing income to a poor, jobless population.

Developing deep geothermal power plants requires the use of expensive and difficult to transport and operate heavy drilling machinery fit for oil and gas market purposes. As a result, up to 70% of the construction costs of geothermal plants are related to drilling. These costs are, in proportion, higher for small geothermal plants. As such, the potential of small-scale geothermal power is hindered where it is needed the most, in remote areas (e.g. rural region, islands) where currently highly polluting diesel generators are being used.
Qmatec is the Norwegian market leader in the supply of mobile drilling rigs.

158,774866,HP-MOSES,Solar assisted high temperature heat pumps for molten salt energy storage applications.,"Aiming at an integrated EU energy system, the work programme expresses the need for Europe to develop next generation competitive technologies for the electricity transmission network, which will be going beyond the state of the art and will be ready to integrate the market in five to ten years' time. Among these technologies, energy storage systems play a crucial role for the flexibility, stability and security of the European electricity network in the context of a progressively higher integration of variable renewable energies into the grid.  
The main objective of the proposal is the technical and economic feasibility analysis of a large-scale (50-1000MW) molten salt energy storage system based on solar assisted high temperature heat pumps (HP-MOSES).  
The proposed HP-MOSES storage system consists of a solar assisted supercritical heat pump cycle converting the electricity surplus into high temperature heat during charging. The heat is then stored for the required time in a molten salt hot tank, and is converted back to electric energy in a thermal engine  during the discharging cycle. 
HP-MOSES is expected to be a cost-effective and commercially viable large-scale site-independent energy storage system. 
With these features it can be considered as a valid alternative to existing bulk storage technologies in terms of round-trip-efficiency and cost of stored energy.",2017-05-01,2017-10-31,50000.0,['Storage'],"['energy storage', 'heat pump']",3,9

It aims to reduce carbon emissions by 60% relative to the 1990 level by 2050 and increase the use of renewable energy to 20% by 2020. Buildings account for about 40% energy consumption in the EU and the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling of buildings will be important in achieving this goal.
Transformation of the EU new-existing building stock towards low/zero energy buildings requires effective integration and full use of the potential yield of intermittent renewable energy sources. Thermochemical heat storage (THS) can play a pivotal role in synchronizing energy demand and supply, on both short and long term basis. The proposed solar powered thermochemical heat storage (Solar-Store) system will integrate solar collector, evaporative humidifier and heat pipe technology with a novel THS reactor design for seasonal storage of solar energy. The proposed system will deliver efficient, low-cost THS that can be fitted in the limited space in dwellings. The fellowship aims to benefit from Prof. Yijun Yuanâ€™s recent work in energy storage systems, making use of sorption materials and solar thermal technology. Professor Yuan's considerable industrial and academic experience will make valuable contribution to the EU host organisation in terms of technology/knowledge transfer, PhD student/young researcher training and IP/commercialisation of new technologies. The partner organisations will also involve to this interaction (secondments) to enhance the effectiveness of the fellowship.

An appropriate cleaning schedule can raise the energy yield of the PV modules and reduce the operating costs, increasing the revenues and, at the same time, limiting the need of non-renewable energy generation. NoSoilPV aims to tackle this issue by developing a smart method capable of quantifying the soiling accumulated on the PV modules in real time without the need of expensive additional hardware. Moreover, through the analysis of historical precipitation datasets and the use of weather prediction models, the algorithm developed in this project will predict the economic impact of soiling and notify at which time artificial cleanings should be performed in order to minimize costs and maximize the energy production.
NoSoilPV will be conducted by Dr. Leonardo Micheli within the Centre for Advanced Studies in Energy and Environment (CEAEMA) of the University of JaÃ©n (Spain). CEAEMA is an ideal environment for this project, which involves PV performance analysis, weather and dust prediction modelling and machine learning techniques, because of the high quality research conducted in PV and in all the multidisciplinary aspects of the project. NoSoilPV aims to answer a number of unsolved questions in soiling and to provide the community a useful tool to increase the energy production and the economic revenues. The project will support the EU in its effort to increase the clean energy share and to maximize material efficiency, leading to an increase in PV energy yield, without the installation of new modules or systems. In addition, this fellowship will favor the EU reintegration of Dr. Micheli and will give him the opportunity to enhance his career as an independent researcher.",2018-06-01,2020-05-31,158121.6,,"['PV', 'renewable energy', 'photovoltaic']",3,9

Specific work on standardisation will ensure that the lessons learned are applicable to the full range of OEMs supplying vehicles into the European market, helping to accelerate the introduction of next generation products. In parallel, the demonstration activities will greatly raise awareness of the viability of fuel cells as a solution to demanding heavy duty vehicle uses (and raise public awareness of hydrogen mobility more generally due to the visibility of the trucks). A successful demonstration of fuel cell trucks will have substantial impacts beyond the technical progress delivered by the project itself, as it will enable public authorities to continue implementing bold decarbonisation strategies by providing clear evidence that viable zero emissions solutions will exist for all vehicle types in the medium term. The project will also support the wider rollout of hydrogen mobility by introducing a further source of hydrogen demand that can improve the economics of existing and future refuelling station deployments, in turn facilitating the rollout of other vehicle types.",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,4993851.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,9

It aims to help accelerating the R&D efforts into silicon solar cells, the dominating PV technology with a persistent market share of around 90%. Basis for this forms â€œQuokkaâ€, a multidimensional silicon solar cell simulation tool recently developed by the applicant. Quokka is specifically designed for silicon solar cell conditions, which allows for valid simplifications to the general semiconductor modelling approaches, and sets it apart from generally more powerful commercial software and other free tools in terms of computational speed and ease of setup. Since its release for free early 2013, Quokka sees a rapid increase of usage amongst all major PV research institutes and manufacturers.
Within this project, the applicant will grow Quokka from its (capable) childhood to a mature simulation tool, being supported by the world-leading expertise in solar cells of the host institution, Fraunhofer ISE. One measure consists in coding optimized numeric routines to efficiently handle much larger mesh sizes, e.g. enabling the unprecedented and very useful capability of simulating a full size silicon solar cell. Furthermore, several physical models of highest future relevance will be identified, experimentally validated and added to Quokkaâ€™s capabilities. Accessibility to PV scientists, engineers and students in Europe and worldwide forms a key point of this project, and will be achieved by publishing underlying algorithms and validation cases, and by continued free hosting, integration and documentation on the leading web-portal for solar cell modeling.

Insights gained from advanced in-situ and in-operando analysis methods will be used for multi scale modelling targeting on the simulation of aging mechanisms for a reliable lifetime prediction and enhancement. In addition, the latest generation of anode materials based on silicon as well as a prelithiation process for lifetime enhancement will be implemented in the cell manufacturing process. The implementation of high energy materials combined with a low cost and environmental benign aqueous cathode manufacturing process will lead to remarkable cell costs reduction down to 130 â‚¬ per kWh.

165,774974,NextWind,Harvesting airborne wind energy using rigid kites.,"Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a renewable energy source with a huge potential, but remains yet to be harnessed at a commercial scale. Commercialization of AWE will contribute in reaching the committed share of 27% renewables in Europe by 2030. 

The wind energy is stronger and more steady at higher altitudes, which means that AWE can be installed in locations where wind turbines are not viable. AWE can also be used in locations where conventional wind turbines have a negative impact on the visual environment. Contrary to conventional wind turbines, kite turbines have a very small footprint on the ground and are hardly visible up in the air. A complete construction of a kite turbine requires only 10% the mass of a conventional wind turbine and yearly operational hours can double due to high altitude operation.

The Norwegian based AWE producer, Kitemill has demonstrated autonomous operation of their 30-kW kite turbine in operational environment at their test site. 

Their unique features for succeeding in commercialization of kite turbines:
 â€¢ The first airborne wind energy supplier to feature vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) solution. The advantage with a    VTOL system is a minimized landing platform since it only need to be as wide as the wingspan of the kite. 
â€¢ Customer secured for a demo park consisting of five 30-kW kite turbines. 
â€¢ The first company to have obtained permanent operating license in designated areas issued by National Aviation Authorities.
â€¢ Commercialization strategy will start with the 30-kW kite turbine to obtain a high number of operational hours at a smaller scale, which will reduce risk for the customers when introducing a new energy technology.

Heat-to-fuel will achieve competitive prices for biofuel technologies (<1â‚¬/l) while delivering higher fuel qualities and significantly reduced life-cycle GHG reductions. Heat-to-fuel will result in increased Energy production savings (>20%) and enhanced EUâ€™s energy security by the use of local feedstocks which in turn ensured local jobs are preserved and increased. The benefit of combining technologies like in Heat-to-Fuel is, that the drawbacks of the single technologies are balanced. FT and APR are promising technologies for the efficient production of 2nd generation fuels. But currently the economic border conditions don't allow the implementation, similar to many other biofuel technologies. The radical innovation of combining an APR with a FT reactor is the basis to overcome this barrier. The large organic wastes (from HTL or other streams) can be conveniently treated with APR to produce H2. Both dry and wet organic wastes can be integrated, with mutual advantages, i.e. steam production for gasification, HTL and APR preheating; FT heat cooling without external utilities. Using the synergies between these technologies maximizes the total process efficiency.

MinWaterCSP will reduce water evaporation losses by 75 to 95% compared to wet cooling systems. It aims to increase the net efficiency of the steam Rankine cycle by 2%, or alternatively reduce the capital cost of a dry-cooling system by 25%, while maintaining cycle efficiency. To complement this, mirror cleaning water consumption will be reduced by 25% through an improved mirror cleaning process for parabolic trough collectors, the development of a cleaning robot for linear Fresnel collectors and a reduced number of cleaning cycles enabled by an enhanced monitoring of the reflectance of the mirrors. Also, comprehensive water management plans for CSP plants in various locations will be developed and combined with plant performance simulations to maximize the impact of the achieved design improvements in a complete system context. Zero liquid discharge and the option of making use of solar energy or low grade waste heat for water treatment will be considered. MinWaterCSP will improve the cost-competitiveness of CSP. This will make CSP more attractive for investment purposes and drives growth in the CSP plant business as well as job creation at European companies which provide technologically advanced CSP plant components.

168,646554,PV FINANCING,PV FINANCING,"Feed-in tariffs (FITs) have been the fuel for successful solar PV growth stories in basically every one of todayâ€™s large solar markets. First in Europe, now in China and Japan. The US is the only exception â€“ backed by tax credits and net-metering, leasing has become a key means of financing residential solar systems there.
With many European countries phasing out FITs, the simplicity of selling solar power will be gone; and without safe and fair returns, real estate and homeowners will not invest in PV anymore. In post-FIT times, solar companies and/or electric utilities in partnership with financial institutions will have to come up with new business models and financing schemes for PV investors in order to continue the success story of the FIT era. 
The German Solar Industry Association as project coordinator is driven by the mission to successfully evolve those business and financing models, to disseminate them among stakeholders and to shape the necessary policy framework and to remove barriers that prevent those models from realization. 
Consequently, the goal of PV Financing is to help stakeholders from specific application segments with the implementation of PV projects based on new PV business models while applying innovative equity and debt financing schemes.

169,638133,ThforPV,New Thermodynamic for Frequency Conversion and Photovoltaics,"'The Shockley Queisser (SQ) limits the efficiency of single junction photovoltaic (PV) cells and sets the maximum efficiency for Si PV at about 30%. This is because of two constraints: i. The energy PV generates at each conversion event is set by its bandgap, irrespective of the photonâ€™s energy. Thus, energetic photons lose most of their energy to heat. ii. PV cannot harness photons at lower energy than its bandgap. Therefore, splitting energetic photons, and fusing two photons each below the Si bandgap to generate one higher-energy photon that match the PV, push the potential efficiency above the Shockley Queisser limit. Nonlinear optics (NLO) offers efficient frequency conversion, yet it is inefficient at the intensity and the coherence level of solar and thermal radiation. 
Here I propose new thermodynamic concepts for frequency conversion of partially incoherent light aiming to overcome the SQ limit for single junction PVs. Specifically, I propose entropy driven up-conversion of low energy photons such as in thermal radiation to emission that matches Si PV cell. This concept is based on coupling 'hot phonons' to Near-IR emitters, while the bulk remains at low temperature. As preliminary results we experimentally demonstrate entropy-driven ten-fold up-conversion of 10.6ï­m excitation to 1ï­m at internal efficiency of 27% and total efficiency of 10%. This is more efficient by orders of magnitude from any prior art, and opens the way for efficient up-conversion of thermal radiation. 
We continue by applying similar thermodynamic ideas for harvesting the otherwise lost thermalization in single junction PVs and present the concept of 'optical refrigeration for ultra-efficient PV' with theoretical efficiencies as high as 69%. We support the theory by experimental validation, showing enhancement in photon energy of 107% and orders of magnitude enhancement in the number of accessible photons for high-bandgap PV.

The development of new materials and technologies, wherein both anions and cations display reversible, multi-electron redox, is bound to strongly impact this field. 
MOOiRÃ‰ will challenge this goal through innovative approaches on Metal Organic Compounds and Frameworks (MOC/Fs) with mix-in many-electron reversible redox of both, transition metal cations and organic ligand anions.

The maintenance of optimal temperatures and optimal light incidence is critical for high crop yields. In summer, GHs are typically white washed or shaded by nets or by screens, in order to avoid excess temperature in the GH. Standing out, this sunlight surplus can be turned into electricity by adding PV panels, which can supply electricity to the national grid and/or supply the required energy for a heating/cooling system for the optimal control of the GH micro-climate. 
However, previous attempts of dual harvesting, which have been performed mainly in Italy and Spain, used conventional PV panels or semi transparent PV panels that were positioned to receive maximum sunlight on the south facing roof of GHs and significantly shaded crops all year around, resulting in a significant a negative effect, not only with regards to high crop yields loss, up to 25% but also to negative effects on edibles and fruit size, hardness and colour, which reduce sell prices of affected crops.
On the other hand, If PV panels would have been placed in other positioning then, PV harvesting would underperform and consequently PV yields would be reduced. SUN4GREEN new smart design directs light either into the greenhouse or to the PV panels depending on the season need.
What makes SUN4GREEN different and revolutionary is that its performance is season dependant and is adapted to GH characteristics. Its design allows growers having real dual sun and crop harvesting targeted to obtain benefits from both sources, which is not possible with simple, direct PV technology implementation, not adaptable to seasonal agriculture requirements and where thus, agriculture was compromised to make room for PV electricity production.

â€¢	To further support the deployment PV systems for electricity generation with focus on physical and financial grid interactions
â€¢	To provide PV Prosumers (households and industries) with competitive and sustainable electricity

At the time being many EU Member States have drastically reduced measures to further support the development of the RES sector, even though several projects have clearly demonstrated the need to maintain the policies to support RES until when a consolidated competitiveness has been achieved. 
Such competetiveness for variable RES will depend on the ability of the existing or future electricity markets to provide them with adequate revenues, whatever the size of the plant.  
In addition, the variable aspect of PV doesnâ€™t allow them by nature to bid on the market at chosen times, with a possible and already visible impact on the market prices. The consequence could be that under such conditions, their competitiveness will become more difficult to achieve unless the consumers could become more responsive to price signals and allow to displace the load.

Reliable and sustainable energy sources that can be utilized in large parts of Europe and that are able to balance these fluctuations are needed. Geothermal energy has the potential to become an excellent source for both base and flexible energy demands, providing much lower environmental footprint than both fossil and biomass fuels, as well as much less risks and societal resistance than nuclear power. 

There are however some techno-economic challenges which needs to be addressed to facilitate highly flexible operation of geothermal power plants. In GeoSmart, we propose to combine thermal energy storages with flexible ORC solutions to provide a highly flexible operational capability of a geothermal installation. During periods with low demand, energy will be stored in the storage to be released at a later stage when the demand is higher. As this approach does not influence the flow condition at the wellhead, critical infrastructures will be unaffected under variable energy generation. To improve efficiency, we also propose a hybrid cooling system for the ORC plant to prevent efficiency degradation due to seasonal variations. Efficiency will be further improved by larger power plant heat extraction enabled due to a scaling reduction system consisting of specially design retention tank, heat exchanger, and recombining with extracted gases. The scaling reduction system has the potential to almost double power production of many medium enthalpy geothermal plants. Overall, GeoSmart technologies will drastically reduce geothermal energy costs, making it cost competitive with its fossil fuel-based counterparts.
To bring GeoSmart technology to TRL7/8, we will demonstrate it in a medium/high (Turkey) and low (Belgium) temperature fields to show its potential benefits and applicability in different settings.",2019-06-01,2023-05-31,17363898.25,"['Storage', 'Wind', 'Fuel']","['geothermal', 'geothermal power', 'geothermal energy']",6,8

As a result, new more efficient energy structures are emerging, like Smart Grids, Micro Grids and Virtual Power Plants (VPPâ€™s), but inverters on the market are not suitable, since they lack features such as integrated storage capabilities and bidirectional power flow. Another challenge the grid is facing is the spreading of electric vehicles and the electrification of transport in general, which calls for safe and quick vehicle charging.
 
Ferroamp Elektronik (Sweden) is proposing the FerroHub, an innovative electronic hub leveraging several patents, which fully supports smart grids. The solution incorporates a PV inverter, energy storage and the necessary hardware and software to handle power flow to and from the network, as well as other innovative technologies developed by Ferroamp that augment the stability of the power network and empower the users to gain control of their energy costs. Big loads (in the case of EV charging for example) will not be a problem anymore, since FerroHub can use the integrated storage to provide the excess power needed.

This incapacity to consume large amounts of excess electricity has been one of the biggest obstacles to high penetration of renewable energy systems, such as wind power. 
Our CEO, JosÃ© Campos Rodrigues, Electrical and Nuclear Engineer, has invented, patented and demonstrated a new technology for efficient electrochemical production of synthetic natural gas (SNG). This is considered a great energy storage due to rising prices for natural gas and the dependency from imports, and as energy carrier offers the advantages to be easily stored, transported and back-converted into energy.
The European Patented Electrogas is a system that can be scaled from 1kW up to 1MW of power and will generate SNG using available non-dispatchable electricity.
Conventional techniques to produce SNG require high temperatures and pressures. The capacity of Electrogas to produce synthetic gas at low temperature and pressure is revolutionary for its technical and economic feasibility.
Our consolidated market segments will exceed 5 billion â‚¬ in 2020 (2 digits annual growth rate), including Synthetic Fuels, the Electricity storage market, grid management systems, Islands and other isolated systems and micro-grids.

To exceed this goal a commercial CSP plant of > 1GW of nominal capacity is foreseen, in which  high nominal capacity of CSP plant is reached in a modular way where each MOSAIC module delivers thermal energy to linked thermal energy storage systems that supply their energy to a high capacity power block (>1GW). This modular configuration guarantees reliability, flexibility and dispatchability according to the needs of the electrical grid while reduces significantly the specific cost of the Power block (â‚¬/MW installed).  
Each MOSAIC module consists of an innovative fixed spherical mirror concentrator arranged in a semi-Fresnel manner and an actuated receiver based on a low cost closed loop cable tracking system. This configuration reduces the moving parts of the whole system decreasing solar field cost while keeping high concentration ratios. This will assure high working temperatures thus high cycle efficiencies and a cost effective use of thermal storage systems. 
Energy from the sun is collected, concentrated and transferred to the heat transfer fluid at module level where, due to the modular concept, distances from the solar concentrator to the receiver are much shorter that those typical from solar tower technologies. As a result, the efficiency of energy collection is maximized, atmospherical attenuation is minimized and accuracy requirements can be relaxed.
All these technical benefits contribute to a much lower capital cost of the whole system while keeping efficiency and reliability. This has consequently a strong impact in the final cost of electricity production.

Small wind can play an important role in meeting this challenge by providing reliable decentralized renewable energy. However, there are a number of technical and economic barriers the small wind industry needs to overcome in order to become fully competitive. These include low performances in urban environments with slow and turbulent winds, high noise levels, need for reliable safety systems to avoid over-speeding, risks to birds and high upfront investments for the purchase and installation of the technology. 

Existing market solutions only cover a certain range of wind speeds and have low performances in slow winds. They also cause uncomfortable noise with levels that can reach 60dBA - above WHO standards (40 â€“ 55 dBA) - while posing a collision hazard for birds during flight. In economic terms, the average final installed costs of a small wind turbine are around â‚¬10,000 to â‚¬15,000. 

SEESWIND is the first technology in the small wind market that offers solutions to cover the full range of winds and user demands thanks to its modular and easy to install (plug & play) configuration, ensuring a silent (0 dBA), efficient and safe performance while reducing by 10-40% the overall final cost for the user.

This Calcium-looping process (CaL) is the basis of a proven pilot-scale technology for CO2 capture, which is accomplished by carbonation of CaO and its regeneration in a calciner reactor operated under high CO2 partial pressure and high temperature. The wide availability of limestone (<10â‚¬/ton) is a key factor for the feasibility of the CaL process. However, the huge potential for lime also to store energy has been inhibited by its propensity to sinter at the high temperatures of the standard CaL cycle for CO2 capture, which reduces dramatically its multicycle conversion. SOCRATCES will be built on previous R&D results of the partners indicating that the CaL process can be integrated into CSP plants for thermochemical energy storage and power generation by means of a simple closed CO2 loop. High global efficiencies (>45%) are achieved under new CaL conditions implying carbonation under high temperature (>850ÂºC) at high CO2 partial pressure  compatible with high efficiency power blocks. Moreover, fast calcination is carried out at temperatures < 700ÂºC by the Flash Calcination technology, which allows using mature and inexpensive solar receiver technology.

A custom heat pipe heat exchanger will be modelled and designed around the requirements of heat transport capacity wick structure and capable of heat exchange with a molten salt pumping loop. This loop will include dual media thermocline thermal storage system with cost/system modelling, validation and instrumentation incorporated. A pilot Smartrec system will be constructed and deployed in a secondary aluminium recycler and/or ceramic processor valorising high grade heat for continuous energy-intensive salt-cake recycling. Smartrec will be validated by integration with existing systems with >6 months operation including a fully developed instrumentation framework. A knowledge-based tool will be developed containing all relevant Smartrec parameters and information to model the system fully and allow users to determine their requirements, potential benefits and integrate Smartrec into their own systems via an open access workshop hosted by the consortium.",2016-09-01,2019-08-31,3705625.02,['Storage'],"['thermal storage', 'recycling']",3,8

Yet, current technology requires to employ huge blades to obtain more energy. This is not efficient and safe as they need high initial investment in the turbines manufacturing, transportation and ground works and a major portion of land, which increases the rental costs and can displace farming from fertile land. Also, the blades are prone to erosion, requiring costly operation maintenance and they can be a safety hazard to the people working in these wind farms when submitted to tornados or hurricanes.
Our CCG technology is based on the concept of a packed and controlled cyclone inside a hollow tower, which rotates the turbine blades on the top of the structure. In this way a CCG 30 MW unit (15x more than the most common turbines) occupies 30x less space. Our CCG solution is simple and easy to build, consisting of a turbine generator and a reinforced concrete structure, it can be installed using current road ways. Thanks to these features, CCG can be installed in onshore locations, where winds >30 m/s, may occur. It will reduce by 50% energy costs compared with conventional horizontal-axis wind turbines, i.e. LCOE (0.02-0.03 â‚¬/kW) CAPEX (750-950 â‚¬/kW) Our target market will be existing onshore wind farms for repowering and planned wind farms, i.e. > 900 GW in 2022. Thanks to the uniqueness of CCG, we expect to get at least a 1% penetration in the wind energy sector by 2024, which means over 1 GW capacity installed with our technology and a ROI of 9.8.

In this context, NEOHIRE main objective is to reduce the use of REE, and Co and Ga, in WTG. This objective is mainly achieved through the development of: a) New concept of bonded NdFeB magnets able to substitute the present state-of-the-art sintered magnets for WT, and b) New recycling techniques for these CRM from the future and current PM wastes. In this way, the EU external demand of REE and CRM for PM in WTG will be reduced in a 50%.
The specific objectives are: i) To develop a new NdFeB material solution that reduces the use REE and CRM amount in PM for WTG (100% of HRE, 30% of LRE Nd/Pr, and 100% of CRM Co and Ga), ii) To increase the deliverable electric power in wind power electric generators from current 2.74 MW to 3.56 MW per 1Tn of REE owing to novel electric machine designs, iii) To research and develop two recycling processes to highly increase the CRM recycling rates in NdFeB PM wastes for sintered PM from current WT (increase from 0 to 70% the recovered Nd, separate 100% of Dy and recover 90% of Co) and novel Bonded NEOHIRE PM (recycling almost 95% of Nd), iv) To achieve an economic and technically feasible large-scale framework for NdFeB PM commercial recycling, and v) To ensure the economic and technical sustainability of NdFeB resin-bonded PM developed technologies.

Oddly enough, the low availability has almost always been due to control issues and hybridisation strategies rather than problems in the fuel cells themselves.

Giantleap aims to increase the availability and reduce the total cost of ownership of FCEBs by increasing the lifetime and reliability of the fuel cell system; this will be achieved with advanced online diagnostics of the fuel cells and the balance-of-plant components of the system, coupled with prognostics methods to calculate the system's residual useful life, and advanced control algorithms able to exploit this information to maximise the system's life.
The same control system will also be engineered for robustness, in order to increase availability to the level of diesel buses or better.

Giantleap will improve the understanding of degradation in fuel-cell systems with extensive experimentation and analysis; diagnostic and prognostic methods will focus on exploitation of current sensors to make the novel control approach cost-effective.
Giantleap includes the demonstration of a prototype in relevant environment, allowing the project to reach technology readiness level 6.

The prototype will be a trailer-mounted fuel-cell based range extender meant for battery city buses. The ability to swap out the range extender in case of malfunctions greatly increases the availability of the bus, while the large battery capacity allows the bus to complete its route should malfunctions occur during usage.

The next decade and beyond may average 1,000 offshore towers/year worldwide, with an overall investment volume around 15-20.000 Mâ‚¬/year. 

This growing sector faces technological challenges, as it is set to move into deeper waters further offshore while being able to reduce the costs in order to reach a competitive LCOE (levelised cost of energy). For water depths above 40m (70% of the future market) approximately 40-50% of investment corresponds to the substructure (foundation and tower). Therefore a significant cost reduction in foundation/tower would drastically improve the overall cost of offshore wind energy. 

This project intends to develop and demonstrate in operative environment a full scale prototype of a revolutionary substructure system for offshore wind turbines. The concept consists in a self-installing precast concrete telescopic tower which for the first time ever shall allow for crane-free offshore installation of foundations, towers and turbines, thus overcoming the constraints imposed by the dependence on offshore heavy-lift vessels. It will allow for a full in-shore preassembly of the complete system, which is key to generate a highly industrialized manufacturing process with high production rates and optimized risk control. The main benefits expected are:
â€¢ 30-40% cost reduction (both CAPEX and OPEX).
â€¢ Large water depth applicability range for deep offshore (>45m water depth). 
â€¢ Supports increased turbine size (5-8MW).
â€¢ Allows for large scale fast industrial deployment of foundations.
â€¢ Reduces dependence on costly and scarce installation vessels.
â€¢ Improved asset integrity (durability)

Currently, virtually all renewable hydrocarbon fuels originate from biomass. Their feasibility to meet the global fuel demand and their environmental impact are controversial. In contrast, SUN-to-LIQUID has the potential to cover future fuel consumption as it establishes a radically different non-biomass non-fossil path to synthesize renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuels from abundant feedstocks of H2O, CO2 and solar energy. Concentrated solar radiation drives a thermochemical redox cycle, which inherently operates at high temperatures and utilizes the full solar spectrum. Thereby, it provides a thermodynamically favourable path to solar fuel production with high energy conversion efficiency and, consequently, economic competitiveness. Recently, the first-ever production of solar jet fuel has been experimentally demonstrated at laboratory scale using a solar reactor containing a ceria-based reticulated porous structure undergoing the redox cyclic process. 
SUN-to-LIQUID aims at advancing this solar fuel technology from the laboratory to the next field phase: expected key innovations include an advanced high-flux ultra-modular solar heliostat field, a 50 kW solar reactor, and optimized redox materials to produce synthesis gas that is subsequently processed to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The complete integrated fuel production chain will be experimentally validated at a pre-commercial scale and with record high energy conversion efficiency.

Thus, it is necessary to identify, develop and validate a more innovative, disruptive approach including new materials and processes to have a chance to reach these ambitious challenges.
In this perspective, the DOLPHIN project is exploring an unconventional, highly innovative route towards a newly designed cell architecture featuring a Dual-Core Single Repeat Unit (DC-SRU).
Thanks to smart approaches in the fields of â€˜Process Integrationâ€™, â€˜Interfaces Qualityâ€™ and â€˜Materials Efficiencyâ€™, DOLPHIN will deliver a light-weight & compact fuel cell and stack architecture with low (mass/charge) transport resistances inside the fuel cell core. Mechanically strong and corrosion resistant structures with redesigned and more coherent cell-internal interfaces will delay the activation of major ageing mechanisms and failures occurrence hence increasing system reliability to a level compatible with automotive durability targets. Finally, by triggering an original concept relying on two integrated multi-functional cores and two architectures (w/o GDM) of increasing level of disruptiveness, DOLPHIN will finally deliver a reinvented process scheme with projected stack production costs less than 20 â‚¬/kW.

Alarmingly, only after a few years of installation, offshore wind turbines (WT) may need emergency repairs. They also feature an extremely short lifespan hindering investments to green energy, effectively designed to reduce CO2 emissions.
We have designed real-time monitoring and diagnostics platform in the context of operation and maintenance scheduling of WT components. Using this architecture, we can quantify the risk of future failure of a given component and trace back the root-cause of the failure. This is business-critical information for Energy Companies and Wind Farm Operators. 
The platform consists of an autonomous software-hardware solution, implementing an Object Oriented Real-Time Decision Tree learning algorithm for smart monitoring and diagnostics of structural and mechanical WT components. The innovative concept lies in running WT telemetry data through a machine learning based decision tree classification algorithm in real-time for detecting faults, errors, damage patterns, anomalies and abnormal operation. We believe our innovation creates evident value and will raise great interest as decision-support tool for WT manufacturers, Wind Farm Operators, Service Companies and Insurers.
In this project, we will carry out pre-commercialisation actions to position ourselves in the market, provide unique selling proposition for future customers as well as raise interest among potential R&D collaborators and pilot customers. We will also establish technology proof of concept for the platform.

The Pulp&Fuel concept is to develop a simple and robust fuel synthesis process taking advantage of the synergy between super critical water gasification (wet gasification) and fixed bed gasification (dry gasification). For the Pulp&Fuel project, we have chosen to study the integration of the full process on a pulp mill. The developed process will take advantage of low to negative value wet and dry resources on a paper mill to add value to the overall process. The yield of biofuels will be significantly increased to 28 % compared to a classic approach that would only yield 18 %.  The Pulp&Fuel final objective is to produce biofuels below 1 â‚¬/L without having a negative impact on the existing operations of the pulp mill. To achieve these goals a team of 10 partners, leaders in their field, from 4 EU-member states, will join efforts.

212,715027,Uniting PV,"Applying silicon solar cell technology to revolutionize the design of thin-film solar cells and enhance their efficiency, cost and stability","Thin film (TF) photovoltaics (PV) hold high potential for Building Integrated PV, an important market as European buildings require to be nearly zero-energy by 2020. Currently, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (= CIGS(e)) TF solar cells have high efficiency, but also a simple one-dimensional cell design with stability and reliability concerns. Furthermore, its present research has been mainly focused on improving the absorber and buffer layers. 
Scientifically, Uniting PV aims to study the practical boundaries of CIGS(e) TF solar cell efficiency. For that reason, its goal is to revolutionize the design of CIGS(e) solar cells through implementation of advanced three-dimensional silicon (Si) solar cell concepts. This novel design consists of (i) surface passivation layers and (ii) light management methods integrated into ultra-thin (UT) CIGS(e) solar cells: (i) Passivation layers will be studied to reduce charge carrier recombination at CIGS(e) surfaces. The aim is to create new understanding and thus scientific models. (ii) Light management methods will be studied to optimize optical confinement in UT CIGS(e) layers. The aim is to examine the interaction between light management and charge carrier recombination in UT CIGS(e), and to create scientific models. The main reasons to introduce these developments is to reduce charge carrier recombination at the CIGS(e) surfaces and in the CIGS(e) bulk, while maintaining optical confinement. 
Technologically, the project targets to establish a solar cell with: (1) Increased cell efficiency, at least 23.0 % and up to 26.0 %; (2) improved stability and reliability, due to reduced CIGS(e) thickness and passivation layers hindering alkali metal movement; and (3) reduced cost, due to the use of less Ga and In, and industrially viable materials, methods and equipment. Hence, its outcome will be upscalable, valuable for other TF PV materials, and start a new wave of innovation in and collaboration between TF and Si PV research fields.",2017-03-01,2022-02-28,1986125.0,,"['solar cell', 'PV']",2,8
213,687561,MONBASA,MONOLITHIC BATTERIES FOR SPACESHIP APPLICATIONS,"The overall ambition of MONBASA is to develop an energy storage system for small satellites (nano-/microsatellites) that outperforms existing solutions and can be integrated with MEMS technology. To be both, applicable and competitive, the novel solution will have to respond to specific needs, namely:

(1) High energy efficiency and density;
(2) Small size and low weight;
(3) High reliability;
(4) Compliance with existing standards and regulation; and
(5) High cost-efficiency.

Any energy storage system will have to first demonstrate its ability to store energy efficiently, within specific power, lifetime and safety specifications and eventually be available at a cost that is ultimately affordable by the nano/microsatellite sector, which is highly cost-sensitive.

Worldwide nanosatellite sector is continuously growing and three main aspects are driving the development: miniaturization, standardization and cost. However Europe has seriously fallen behind competitors from the US and Asia, with regard to R&D in the field of energy storage, which is one of the crucial components for improving and widening small satellites performance and applications.

With its approach, MONBASA is bridging the gap between R&D and market, with the desired future impact being that the provision of tailored energy solutions becomes a European discipline and business. By bringing together a cross-sector consortium that comprises actors from the areas of energy R&D, processing technologies and space applications, the exact needs of the space industry will be considered for innovative energy storage solutions at low TRL levels. This will not only significantly increase future market uptake of a novel solution that so far is in the state of basic research, but it will foster urgently needed intense knowledge exchange between non-space and space actors for jointly developing novel solutions for a field of expectedly strong growth.",2016-06-01,2018-05-31,996465.5,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,8

Following the R&D stage already accomplished and the patent application, the ultimate goal we seek in the project is to complete the prototyping stage and testing studies to reach its commercial appetite and value for leading companies of the wind energy sector such as Siemens and MHI Vestas, which account for more than 80% of the wind turbine manufacturers market share only in Europe.
This is an innovative foundation solution for offshore wind turbines that directly impacts on (1) production costs reducing on circa 30%; (2) on transportation (self-buoyant) and installation (self-installed) with a combined costs savings of 86.5% and operational average time reduction from 12-20h to 3h and; (3) it also affects on the decommissioning phase by 50% reduction. All these costs savings represent circa 16.7% of the total costs of an offshore wind turbine life-cycle. Other crucial aspects are related to structureâ€™s duration extension and less maintenance requirements, technical and operational easiness in all previous phases along with health and safety improvements.

216,785635,ATTACK,Pressured to Attack: How Carrying-Capacity Stress Creates and Shapes Intergroup Conflict,"Throughout history, what has been causing tremendous suffering is groups of people fighting each other. While behavioral science research has advanced our understanding of such intergroup conflict, it has exclusively focused on micro-level processes within and between groups at conflict. Disciplines that employ a more historical perspective like climate studies or political geography report that macro-level pressures due to changes in climate or economic scarcity can go along with social unrest and wars. How do these macro-level pressures relate to micro-level processes? Do they both occur independently, or do macro-level pressures trigger micro-level processes that cause intergroup conflict? And if so, which micro-level processes are triggered, and how?

With unavoidable signs of climate change and increasing resource scarcities, answers to these questions are urgently needed. Here I propose carrying-capacity stress (CCS) as the missing link between macro-level pressures and micro-level processes. A group experiences CCS when its resources do not suffice to maintain its functionality. CCS is a function of macro-level pressures and creates intergroup conflict because it impacts micro-level motivation to contribute to oneâ€™s groupâ€™s fighting capacity and shapes the coordination of individual contributions to out-group aggression through emergent norms, communication and leadership.

To test these propositions I develop a parametric model of CCS that is amenable to measurement and experimentation, and use techniques used in my work on conflict and cooperation: Meta-analyses and time-series analysis of macro-level historical data; experiments on intergroup conflict; and measurement of neuro-hormonal correlates of cooperation and conflict. In combination, this project provides novel multi-level conflict theory that integrates macro-level discoveries in climate research and political geography with micro-level processes uncovered in the biobehavioral sciences",2018-08-01,2023-07-31,2490382.5,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,8
217,792059,GOPV,Global Optimization of integrated PhotoVoltaics system for low electricity cost,"Scenarios have forecasted a long lasting amplification with PV electricity becoming the cheapest electricity source in many regions with costs in the range of 4 to 6 câ‚¬/kWh for EU by 2024, while 2.2 câ‚¬/kWh has been achieved for a 800 MW PV plant planned in Abu Dhabi for 2019.
The PV market will continue to expand in the coming years with more than a doubling in the production capacity expected for 2024. At the same time investment in production capacities is foreseen to keep growing hence maintaining the sector highly competitive. 
For the European PV industry, which is struggling to survive after years of massive investments in China and south-east Asia, the growth of the market represents a chance to come back as a prime player on high-efficiency premium technologies. This is the positioning of GOPV to develop highly competitive technologies for the PV utility market and strong synergies between European players. The project will accelerate reduction of electricity cost implementing advanced PV features and creating synergies across 5 topic areas: Light Management; Energy Efficiency; Material Efficiency; System Reliability; and System configuration and O&M. Ultimately, it will set up an integrated 500 kW PV system to demonstrate a competitive electricity cost of 0.02 â‚¬/kWh for irradiation levels of 1900 kWh/mÂ²/year GHI in Southern Europe. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) will hence be reduced by 50% (currently 0,04 â‚¬/kWh) and the energy payback time reduced by 40%, both in respect to actual standard solution and to PERC best in class mono-facial solution. GOPV project will deliver a 35 years lifetime for the PV string instead of 25 years standards.
Beyond GOPV, the global turnover for the six industrial partners exploiting the results of the project will be close to 48 Mâ‚¬ (2022) and will reach 680 Mâ‚¬ in 2027 (x 14 compare to 2020) with an expectation of creating more than 2000 jobs on the 2022-27 period.",2018-04-01,2022-03-31,9775000.75,,['PV'],1,8

These â€˜coatingsâ€™ comprise functional and performance coatings and paints as well as adhesion layers. Therefore, novel triggerable smart polymer material systems and the corresponding recycling processes will be developed. The triggerable solutions will be based on smart additives (like microcapsules or microwave triggered additives) for the â€˜coatingâ€™ formulations that will be activated by a specific trigger (heat, humidity, microwave, chemical). 
A continuous recycling pilot plant will demonstrate the novel DECOAT principle that allows upgrading existing mechanical recycling by adding tools for sorting by and activation of the trigger. The optimal use of the CreasolvÂ® process for recycling of coated parts will be assessed. The focus is on recycling of the bulk material, but re-use of the coatings materials themselves will also be tackled. Using these recycling processes, circular use of demo cases for outdoor gear, household electronics and automotive parts will be validated.
The novel triggerable DECOAT technologies will create new markets for additives, coatings, paints and adhesives fulfilling the recycling need. The concepts will support designers and product developers for making â€˜recyclable-by-designâ€™ products. This will create direct business opportunities for the DECOAT partners and serve as examples for promoting DECOAT solutions to the wider stakeholder community. 
The targeted products (parts) are coated plastic from cars, electrical and electronic equipment and coated textiles which produce annually almost 3.5 million tons waste. DECOAT will lead to a decrease in landfilling of ca. 75% and a reduction in the carbon footprint by at least 30% for these products. By enabling their recycling, DECOAT is expected to generate on medium term a novel market of over 150 million in Europe (or ca 500 jobs).",2019-01-01,2023-01-31,5901707.5,,['recycling'],1,8
219,818232,GEORISK,Developing geothermal and renewable energy projects by mitigating their risks.,"Geothermal project development has several risky components, the most important one being the resource risk. This concerns mainly deep geothermal projects, but some shallow geothermal open systems could also be included in this category of projects. Beyond exploration, the bankability of a geothermal project is threatened by this geological risk. The geological risk includes: - The short-term risk of not finding an economically sustainable geothermal resource after drilling;  - The long-term risk of the geothermal resource naturally depleting rendering its exploitation economically unprofitable. Until the first borehole has been drilled into the geothermal reservoir, developers cannot be sure about the exact parameters (temperature and flow rate) of the planned geothermal electricity or h&c project. Once drilling has taken place, in situ pump tests, temperature and hydrological measurements then reduce the resource risk and make it possible to attract external capital.  Risk insurance Funds for the geological risk already exist in some European countries (France, Germany, Iceland, The Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland). The geological risk is a common issue all over Europe.  With the notable exception of these six countries, project developers have very little capability to manage this financial risk.  GEORISK project will work to establish such risk insurance all over Europe and in some key target third countries to cover the exploration phase and the first drilling (test). It means activities to be funded before financial institutions and IPP funding the confirmation drilling and surface systems.

In this context, Shallow Geothermal Energy Systems (SGES) are a stable, reliable and renewable energy source with some key features compared to many other RES: being available everywhere and being capable of providing not only heating, but also cooling with unparalleled efficiency. Amongst SGES, closed loop systems with vertical Borehole Heat Exchangers enjoy the widest deployment in the EU where the total installed number of GSHP units amounts nowadays to about 1,4 million, representing an installed capacity of about 16.500 MWth. Against this background, there is still a need to remove market barriers and gain competitiveness, but also to develop the next generation of geothermal systems with new materials for penetrating further the market of building construction and renovation. Also the area of District Heating and Cooling needs improved heating and cooling storage technologies which could largely benefit from enhanced Underground Thermal Energy Storage (UTES) technologies. By a smart combination of different material solutions under the umbrella of sophisticated engineering, optimization, testing and on-site validation, GEOCOND will develop solutions to increase the thermal performance of the different subsystems configuring an SGES and UTES.

Due to its unique positive power temperature coefficient, the efficiency of amorphous silicon (a-Si) cell can be higher than that of a crystalline silicon (c-Si) cell when the operating temperature is above 100Â°C, at which heat is able to drive the ORC. This has therefore stimulated the applicants to propose the a-Si PVT-ORC system which combines the respective advantages of PV and solar ORC technologies. The a-Si PVT-ORC system is estimated to have an overall electrical efficiency up to 12.8% at 120Â°C, which is comparable to the c-Si PVT system at 75Â°C, but the former can eliminate expensive battery and use the coupled thermal storage/ORC instead, offering more economic and environmental benefits.
The proposed project will offer an excellent opportunity of training and development for the very promising young researcher. The project has been carefully designed to match Dr Liâ€™s expertise in solar thermal power systems and the expertise of the University of Nottingham in CHP, BiPV, CFD and 3D printing technologies, and thus facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer.

Although the efforts of industry and public entities to support the development of efficient solutions able to capture CO2 and avoid its emission to the atmosphere, thus mitigating the greenhouse effect, currently the Carbon Capture technologies cost is unsustainable: the first Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects cost > 70 â‚¬ per tonne of carbon dioxide captured, a value higher than the European carbon tax (< 15 â‚¬/tons, expected to reach 45 â‚¬/tons in 2021), making the CCS economically inconvenient. 
Carbon Clean Solutions Ltd. has developed a CO2 capture process, called CapCO2 and characterized by two disruptive innovations: 1) the intensified CO2 capture solvent, called CDRMax, with a reduced water content and a higher stability in respect to the industry benchmark solvent MEA; 2) the CO2 absorber and solvent stripper configuration using Rotary Packed Bed (RPB) technology, which reduces the units size of a factor > 9.

Electricity and transport are the largest contributors to GHG emissions; the trend in transport toward electric vehicle will increase pressure on the electricity system and fundamentally change its dynamics. With producers focused on their legitimate business targets, and consumers focused on security of supply and low prices, the burden of decarbonizing electricity falls on policy makers as driving force, and on transport system operators (TSOs) as technical managers that ensure the safety and stability of supply.
Grid stability is a delicate equilibrium, where some agents provide stability via ancillary services (regulating voltage and frequency) and others rely on that stability (consuming energy and/or disturbing the frequency due to embedded capacitors/impedances); power producers are usually stabilizers (synchronous turbines that provide inertia against sudden changes). Penetration of non-synchronous renewables such as Wind and PV threatens to disrupt the balance, especially in islands and poorly interconnected areas, as they provide power but rely on stability provided by others; this forces the system to have lots of synchronous generators idle just for stability, which is inefficient and costly.
GRIDSOL wants to change the approach: we propose Smart Renewable Hubs, where a core of synchronous generators (CSP and biogas combined cycle HYSOL) is integrated with PV under a dynamic control system (DOME), self-regulating and providing ancillary grid services thanks to firm, flexible generation on a single output, tailored to a specific location, relieving pressure on the TSO.

In particular, fuel and oxygen electrode issues and interconnect contact loss will be tackled.

The approach to harnessing the intricate phenomena causing critical performance degradation will be based upon a methodical analysis of in-service performance data correlated with post-operation states, augmented by a dual-focus campaign targeting macroscopic stack testing procedures as well as specific component ageing tests. The probabilistic nature of degradation will be captured by slimming down deterministic simulation models through conception and integration of stochastic correlations between (nominal/accelerated) operating conditions and degradation effects, based on statistically significant data obtained from field-tests and purposely generated experiments. Stochastic interpretation will thus serve the physical description of dominant SOFC degradation mechanisms in CHP and P2X operation, but allowing rapid estimation of remaining useful stack life. 
The combined results will be translated to validated test protocols that allow quantifying and predicting degradation in SOCs as a function of test aggravation, defining appropriate transfer functions between stress-accelerating and real-world conditions.

A HTF (High Temperature Fluid) is a liquid used to heat transport and transfer it in a solar thermal plant. Nowadays, most of the plants (both parabolic or tower technology) use synthetic oil as the HTF, which reaches working temperatures up to 400ÂºC. However, high temperature cycles accelerate oil degradation and then impurities appear. The appearance of impurities is a problem that affects the operation and the integrity of the current CSP power plants.
Oil regeneration is a common operation in many industrial processes, however, there is no specific solution for CSP power plants that meet their efficiency and costs related needs without risking their profitability. By now, CSP power plant operators treat the oil periodically in external far regeneration plants that provide a standard fluid distillation with low efficiency and big fluid loses that represent great costs. Due to sectorâ€™s current constraints to increase power plantâ€™s capital investment and operation & maintenance costs new more efficient, and with more flexible management models, HTF regeneration solutions are required.
TRANSREGEN is a new high efficiency oil regeneration system that implements a compact & transportable design in order to extend fluid generation and waste management possibilities.

The aim is to develop an optimized combination of innovative Thermal Energy Storage-TES (specialized for CSP scale 1-5 MWe) and engineering solutions to improve the number of production hours of an existing small CSP plant, located in a desert area and coupled with an ORC system. With an optimized TES solution, it is possible to extend periods of energy production of a CSP plant (also during non-solar radiation), eliminating or minimizing the need to burn fossil or renewable fuels in hybrid or back-up systems. Nowadays, efforts are being devoted to R&D on TES for large-scale plants, though large potential for small/medium-scale CSP installations exists. 
ORC-PLUS is in the spectrum of â€œlarge scale prototype to pre-commercial scale demonstrationâ€. The technology proposed is based on a solar field, using a thermal oil as Heat Transfer Fluid and ORC power unit coupled with an innovative TES. Experimental demonstration of two different industrial prototypes of TES systems will be performed in relevant  environment (TRL 6). For each prototype, a simulation model of the pilot processes will be developed, with prototypes of TES systems. The models will be optimized on the basis of the characteristics of the site and power load, to determine conditions and relevant parameters of the real scenarios for each application and to select the TES technology best fitting the needs of the targeted sector. Final result will be an industrial pilot plant used to validate the technology in a real operational environment and to demonstrate its feasibility (TLR7).

To the best of our knowledge, the use of this class of reactions for TES applications has not been explored so far. The goal of this study is the identification of solid-state reactions fulfilling a large number of scientific and technological requirements (high storage capacity, good thermal conductivity, mechanical and chemical stability, complete reversibility of a charging/discharging cycles etc.).

However, without new ways to improve the conversion efficiencies further significant cost reductions will be difficult and the c-Si technology will not be able to maintain its dominant role. In the SiTaSol project we want to increase conversion efficiencies of c-Si solar cells to 30 % by combining it with III-V top absorbers. Such a tandem solar cell will result in huge savings of land area and material consumption for photovoltaic electricity generation and offers clear advantages compared to todayâ€™s products. The III-V/Si tandem cell with an active Si bottom junction with one front and back contact is a drop-in-replacement for todayâ€™s Si flat plate terrestrial PV. To make this technology cost competitive, the additional costs for the 2-5 Âµm Ga(In)AsP epitaxy and processing must remain below 1 â‚¬/wafer to enable module costs <0.5 â‚¬/Watt-peak. It is the intention of the SiTaSol project to evaluate processes which can meet this challenging cost target and to proof that such a solar cell can be produced in large scale. Key priorities are focused on the development of a new growth reactor with efficient use of the precursor gases, enhanced waste treatment, recycling of metals and low cost preparation of the c-Si growth substrate. High performance devices will be demonstrated in an industrial relevant environment. The project SiTaSol approaches these challenges with a strong industrial perspective and brings together some of the most well-known European partners in the field of Si PV and III-V compound semiconductors.

239,733815,CAPOWER,ADVANCED MATERIAL FOR COST EFFECTIVE AND HIGH DENSITY ULTRACAPACITORS FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR,"To meet carbon emissions targets, transport must become more energy efficient. Currently only 14%â€“30% of the energy from the fuel you put in a vehicle is used to move it down the road, depending on the drive cycle. The rest of the energy is lost to engine and driveline inefficiencies or used to power accessories.

There are several innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of the vehicles and reduce transport emissions such as regenerative braking systems, start-stop systems, KERS, and ERS. However, all these systems require fast electric energy storage.
Existing technologies for energy storage cannot meet the needs of the transport sector. The conventional technology uses batteries, but these are slow to charge and discharge energy, large and heavy. Ultracapacitors have been put forward as the solution, as they can charge and discharge quickly, however they are currently prohibitively expensive to allow them to be universally taken up across the wider transport sector.

We at Xerolutions have developed a new material, called CAPOWER, which reduces the cost of energy stored in ultracapacitors by over 20%. Compared with the conventional material, CAPOWER increases Power density, Energy density, Cyclability and reduces volume per unit of energy stored.
The cost efficiency of our material will allow the widespread adoption of the latest energy recovery systems to be introduced to all vehicles. 

The aim of the project is to scale up production of CAPOWER and demonstrate its effectiveness to T2 suppliers to kick start its take up in the market, and to thereby facilitate the widespread introduction of the energy efficient technologies. This will in turn reduce emissions and fuel consumption.

Batteries and supercapacitors are two very complementary types of energy storage devices. Batteries store much higher energy densities; supercapacitors, on the other hand, hold one tenth of the electricity per unit of volume or weight as compared to batteries but can achieve much higher power densities. Technology is currently striving to improve the power density of batteries and the energy density of supercapacitors. To do so it is imperative to develop new materials, chemistries and manufacturing strategies.
3D2DPrint aims to develop micro-energy devices (both supercapacitors and batteries), technologies particularly relevant in the context of the emergent industry of micro-electro-mechanical systems and constantly downsized electronics. We plan to use novel two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials obtained by liquid-phase exfoliation. This method offers a new, economic and easy way to prepare ink of a variety of 2D systems, allowing to produce wide device performance window through elegant and simple constituent control at the point of fabrication. 3D2DPrint will use our expertise and know-how to allow development of advanced AM methods to integrate dissimilar nanomaterial blends and/or â€œhybridsâ€ into fully embedded 3D printed energy storage devices, with the ultimate objective to realise a range of products that contain the above described nanomaterials subcomponent devices, electrical connections and traditional micro-fabricated subcomponents (if needed) ideally using a single tool.",2016-10-01,2021-09-30,2499942.0,['Storage'],"['energy storage', 'nanomaterial']",3,7

Another key concept of GEOTâ‚¬CH will be a better integration between heat exchange elements during installation by developing an innovative heat exchanger allowing to achieve high levels of thermal performance with low pressure loss. This device employs a co-axial configuration and spiral fluid flow pathways to achieve low thermal resistance compared to conventional U-tube devices.
Furthermore, GEOTâ‚¬CH aims to implement cost-effective geothermal systems by alleviating the costs associated with drilling boreholes in large size buildings. The GEOTâ‚¬CHâ€™s approach seeks the maximum use of the foundation structures that are otherwise required, exclusively, for structural and geotechnical purposes in tertiary buildings.

The Hydrogen Economy offers ready solutions to decarbonize the transport sector. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) close to be deployed in the market in increasing numbers. For FCEVs to be introduced to the market in volumes, a network of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) first has to exist. Green hydrogen is figured, in the medium â€“ long term, as the target technology to decarbonize the transport sector. Indeed, this will not be commercially attractive in the first years. Similarly, new-built hydrogen supply capacity will not be viable in the first years with low demand.

It uses widely available carbon-lean natural gas (NG) or bio-methane to produce hydrogen and power with Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology. Similar to a combined heat and power system, the high quality heat from the fuel cell is used to generate hydrogen. 
CH2P therefore generates hydrogen and electricity with  high efficiencies (up to 90%) and  a reduced environmental impact compared to conventional technologies. The system will have high dynamic (more than 50% of energy will be in form of hydrogen), purity level of hydrogen at 99.999%,  a CO-level lower than 200 ppb. The target cost for the hydrogen generated will be below 4,5 â‚¬/kg. The overall technology concept will be based on modularity to enable a staged deployment of such infrastructure.

Photovoltaic solar cells can directly convert the sunlight into electric energy by making use of the photovoltaic effect in semiconductors. Halide perovskites are emerging crystalline semiconducting materials with among the strongest light absorption and the most effective electric charge generation needed to design the highest efficient photovoltaic solar cells. The PI has the ambition to reinvent halide perovskites as environmentally friendly photovoltaic material, aiming at:
(i) Removing lead: state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells are based on lead, which is in the list of hazardous substances of the European Union. The PI will prepare new tin-based perovskites and prove them in the highest efficient solar cells.
(ii) Solvent-free crystallisation: organic solvents drive the crystallisation of the perovskite in the most efficient solar cells. However, crystallising the perovskite without using solvents is more environmentally friendly. The PI will establish physical vapour deposition as a solvent-free method for preparing the perovskite and the other materials comprising the solar cell.

approach based on a 1-phase thermodynamic cyclic process instead of the thermodynamic 2-phase compression process of
conventional heat pumps. This, for the first time, enables high-scale industrial use that existing conventional heat pumps

This concerns in particular the fossil fuel-based energy sector as also stated in the H2020 topic â€œSecure, clean and efficient energyâ€. Harnessing solar energy by photovoltaics (PV) is the most promising way towards a decarbonized society. However, efficiency and costs of conventional solar cells are still hampering their broad application.

Recently a novel type of solar cell appeared based on metal-halide perovskite. Due to versatile and simple manufacturing methods, its unique optoelectronic properties and high electronic quality, this material has the potential to revolutionized PV by a unique combination of low-cost and high efficiency. However, there are still loss mechanisms present that need to be understood and eliminated to make this technology really a breakthrough compared to conventional PV.

This project addresses these losses, which are caused by defects (such as grain boundaries, interfaces to contact materials, and impurities) by a combination of in-depth optoelectronic and high-resolution structural characterization. The aim is to reach a completely novel operation regime, the â€œphotonic solar cellâ€, which is at the same time a perfect light emitting diode. This is highly exciting from the physics point of view and directly relevant for application, because performance is increased. Furthermore, the obtained understanding of the defect physics will enable increased long-term stability (one of the major challenges) and accelerate the development of non-toxic lead-free perovskite materials.

This work is timely because trial-and-error engineering approaches, which were applied so far, have come to their limits.

264,718838,FLOW,New Floating Platform for offshore wind in deep waters.,"Wind power has established itself in recent years as a clean alternative to conventional sources of electrical generation. Reduced costs and wider deployment, especially in the European market, have led over the past decade to its use at sea. Here the wind resource is larger and more constant, allowing higher unitary power turbines. However, the marine environment itself also imposes a number of restrictions and challenges. The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources are in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. 
Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact.
The aim of the NFLOW project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:1 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics. 
The design has been focused on 5MW machine, with the aim of reaching 8-10MW machines when available in the future. The already mounted prototypes have wind turbines installed of around 2MW, which prevented an optimization of structures.

Here, the wind resource is larger and more constant, allowing higher unitary power turbines. However, the marine environment itself also imposes a number of restrictions and challenges. The technology that is being deployed now is fixed to the seabed, using different types of foundations, but a large amount of wind resources is in deeper waters, where floating solutions are needed. Because of their initial higher costs, these solutions are still under development, with only three prototypes installed worldwide. The challenge nowadays is to reduce the costs of floating wind turbine structures that will ease the access to a much larger energy potential than available in land, more easily manageable and with lower visual impact. The aim of the SATH project is the demonstration in real conditions of a floating structure for offshore wind which will allow a reduction in LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) over the current floating technology. To achieve this, it is proposed as a first objective the validation and qualifying for this technology, of a 1:3 scaled prototype not only from a technical point of view but also from economic and necessary logistics. The SATH solution is a platform that consists of two cylindrical floats (of prestressed reinforced concrete) which can be manufactured onshore and transported and positioned at the final location in a single mooring point allowing the rotation of the platform around, self-aligning with the wind direction.",2017-02-01,2017-07-31,50000.0,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,7

267,642682,AWESCO,"Airborne Wind Energy System Modelling, Control and Optimisation","The height of conventional wind turbines is limited by the enormous stresses on the structure. The idea of the Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is to replace the most efficient part of a conventional wind turbine, the tip of the turbine blade, with a fast flying high efficiency kite, and to replace the rest of the structure by a tether which anchors the kite to the ground. Power is generated either by periodically pulling a ground based generator via a winch, or by small wind turbines mounted on the kite that exploit its fast cross wind motion. While the concept is highly promising, major academic and industrial research is still needed to achieve the performance required for industrial deployment. This can best be done by innovative junior researchers in a closely cooperating consortium of academic and industrial partners.
The ITN AWESCO combines six interdisciplinary academic and four industrial network partners with seven associated partners, all selected on the basis of excellence and complementarity. All partners work already intensively on AWE systems, several with prototypes, and they are committed to create synergies via the cooperation in AWESCO. The main task is to train fourteen Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) in training-by-research and to create a closely connected new generation of leading European scientists that are ready to push the frontiers of airborne wind energy.
AWESCO is the first major cooperation effort of the most important European actors in the field and will help Europe to gain a leading role in a possibly huge emerging renewable energy market, and to meet its ambitious CO2 targets. In addition, the AWESCO early stage researchers will be trained in cutting-edge simulation, design, sensing, and control technologies that are needed in many branches of engineering.",2015-01-01,2018-12-31,2990467.2,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,7

It is based on the successful UleWIN wood chip and pellet boiler concept consisting of a fixed-bed updraft gasifier directly coupled with a Low-NOx gas burner and a hot water boiler, which shall be further developed for fuel flexible operation (utilisation of forest residues, SRF, miscanthus, olive stones, nut shells and agro-pellets). Moreover, a compact flue gas condensation system with integrated condensate neutralisation, also capable to operate with highly acidic flue gases from agricultural fuel combustion, shall be developed to increase the efficiency of the whole system up to 110% (related to the fuel NCV). An advanced control system as well as measures for improved system integration shall additionally increase the annual utilisation rate up to 95%. It is expected to achieve at the end of the project a TRL of 5.
These objectives are very relevant to the work programme since they focus on highly efficient and fuel flexible residential heat production at almost zero CO and OGC emissions, by 50% reduced NOx emissions (compared with conventional boilers) as well as ultra-low PM emissions below 13 mg/MJ (even when utilising K-rich fuels). Since this shall be reached by primary measures only, fuel flexible heat generation will be possible at reduced heat generation costs in comparison to present heating systems.
To fulfil these goals an overall methodology shall be applied which is divided into a technology development part (based on process simulations, computer aided design of the single units, test plant construction, performance and evaluation of test runs) as well as a technology assessment part covering risk, techno-economic, environmental and overall impact assessments, market studies regarding the possible potentials for application of the new technology as well as dissemination activities.",2016-01-01,2018-12-31,3514397.5,['Fuel'],['updraft'],2,7

ReSOC is an electrochemical device that converts electrical energy into hydrogen (electrolysis mode) or alternatively fuel gas to electrical energy (fuel cell mode). It is characterised by its very high efficiency compared to competing technologies. ReSOC enables to store renewable electricity when it is produced in excess or to convert it into a CO2-free transport fuel. Therefore, it is considered as a key technology to allow the broad penetration of renewable electricity into the European energy system.
Fragmented national research efforts are currently impeding quicker development and deployment of next-generation fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. Therefore, BALANCE will identify, quantify and analyse national activities dealing with the diverse aspects of ReSOC technology. This analysis will result in an integrated European research agenda for ReSOC technology to gain synergies and to generate breakthroughs in this highly promising but currently low-TRL technology. Close communication with the advisory board will enable alignment of the proposed agenda with the roadmaps and activities of EERA, IEC and IEA on the topic of hydrogen technologies.
Technical development will cover the development of the next generation of ReSOC cells, their integration in the optimised stack assembly, and investigation of the constraints from reversible operation at system level and integration with the grid. Cost will be addressed by using low-cost materials and improving manufacturability. The experimental work will be supported by modelling and simulation at all scales and by the techno-economic analysis of different integration of the ReSOC technology in industrial applications.",2016-12-01,2019-11-30,2500596.25,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,7

This waste stream is expected to exponentially increase with an increasing number of 2G bioethanol plants being built, according to a report of the International Energy Agency.
FALCON aims to convert this lignin-rich industrial waste of 2G biofuel plants to higher value products, in particular shipping fuels, fuel additives and chemical building blocks. This would be the next consecutive step in turning waste to products, thus minimizing waste and simultaneously providing new alternatives for fossil resource based processes. The FALCON process is based on enzymatic and mild chemical conversion of the lignin waste stream, providing a more environmentally friendly approach to the production of fuels and chemical building blocks.
FALCON takes full advantage of the lessons learned over the last 150 years in the petrochemical industry with respect to design of the processes. This implies an initial treatment at the 2G bioethanol plant, converting the waste to a lignin oil that can be more easily transported and also directly used as a low sulphur shipping fuel. It will be further converted into fuel additives and chemical building blocks in centralized facilities.
To achieve this, FALCON has formed a consortium of industry (3), SME (4) and academics (2) covering the whole value chain from a 2G biofuel plant delivering the lignin waste to enzyme producers, chemists and process engineers to depolymerize the lignin to oil. End-users are a fuel and chemicals producer and a ship engine developer.

The use of fuel cells in this critical sector is currently prevented due to the high spatial requirements of multiple smaller modules, high capital cost compared to other technologies, and complexity of integration. ELECTROU will break all of these barriers. The project will demonstrate to key decision makers, investors and financiers that there is a near term route to produce electricity and heat in a highly efficient way by a technology which is commercially viable today.

ELECTROU will prove through funding support that multi-MW installations within buildings can make an investment grade return without the need for any form of local or EU subsidy, this is a critical step in making the sector viable. A targeted dissemination campaign will be performed to share all of the results with stakeholders and the general public that promotes the technical, commercial and environmental benefits of this mature but high tech technology. We will develop one valid process for all fuel cell installations in Europe by supporting the set-up of simplified regulations, codes and standards that as a result will positively influence market entry throughout the EU.",2018-01-01,2023-06-30,6000000.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,7
284,654444,OPERA,Open Sea Operating Experience to Reduce Wave Energy Cost,"Europe is endowed with abundant wave energy which could cover some 10% of its electricity needs with a clean, predictable and job-creating resource,  which EU companies are at the forefront exploiting with little dependence on foreign suppliers.

There remain important technical challenges to bring down costs to within investorsâ€™ reach, as a top priority open-sea operating experience must be analysed to permit the focus of R&D efforts on identifying and solving problems uncovered in open-sea deployments. However, to this day, most wave energy R&D does not have access to open-sea operating data as they are not shared by the companies that sponsored open-sea tests. 

OPERA will remove this roadblock by collecting and sharing two years of open-sea operating data of a floating oscillating water column wave energy converter. In addition the project will be the first open-sea deployment for four cost-reducing innovations that will be advanced from TRL3-4 to TRL5. Together, these four innovations have a long-term cost reduction potential of over 50%. These are: a 50% more efficient turbine, latching and predictive control, a shared mooring system for wave energy similar to those that have reduced mooring costs 50% in aquaculture, and an elastomeric mooring tether that reduces peak loads at the hull-mooring connection 70% and thus addresses one of the most pressing challenges for structural survivability of wave energy devices. 

Documenting and sharing this open-sea experience will also induce a step-change in our knowledge of risk and uncertainties, costs and societal and environmental impacts of wave energy. The consortium brings together world leaders in wave energy research from four European countries and the IPR owner and most advanced teams to exploit each of these innovations. 

Last but not least, the project brings national in-cash co-financing of over â‚¬2 million to directly fund the open-sea testing.",2016-02-01,2019-07-31,5741263.75,,['wave energy'],1,7

The part of the project will focus on inviting companies to matchmaking events so they can make new connections and find partners with whom to work on their plans. The project will also target two specific industrial companies: one, ENEL Green Power, will try to make progress on the Implementation Plan by coordinating the many different PV actors in Italy; the other, Photowatt, will work mostly privately but tap the consortium's expertise and those of scientists whom it will select to help it make the right strategic technical choices to be a serious competitor in PV manufacturing.

Another important part of the project is to monitor progress in PV. Data will be collected on public spending in the EU, on private spending, on the kinds of projects being funded and on the overall performance of PV technology. Forecasts for future spending will be made according to various scenarios. The project will track whether improvements in the performance of technology are keeping pace with expectations. It will make recommendations to European funding authorities on how they can play their part in putting European PV technology back the top of the class if it is falling behind.",2019-04-01,2022-03-31,1094565.0,,['PV'],1,7

An intriguing theory suggests that altered brain development results in schizophrenia, and the selective cellular defects in parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons observed in schizophrenic patient brains.  However, the role of altered interneuron development in producing these pathophysiological hallmarks of schizophrenia is currently unknown due to a lack of cellular models of human interneuron development.  Cerebral organoids are a revolutionary in vitro model of embryonic brain development generating complex brain circuits and recapitulating many aspects of interneuron development.  The generation of organoid tissue from hiPSCs allows for the growth of patient-specific brain tissue.  Therefore, the current proposal will develop a cerebral organoid schizophrenia model to analyze PV-interneuron development.  First, cerebral organoids will be grown from patient-derived hiPSCs genetically modified to include a PV-GFP reporter.  Using this reporter, genome-wide PV-specific gene expression will be analyzed to identify deregulated developmental pathways during PV-interneuron development.  Second, a phenotypic analysis of PV-interneuron development will determine how PV-interneuron synaptic morphology and/or migration are altered in this cerebral organoid schizophrenia model.  These assays are relevant to disease-related pathology, and will include axonal morphological analysis and a novel organoid co-culture migration assay.  These results will determine the role of interneuron development in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disease for the first time in human tissue.  Understanding the developmental mechanisms of schizophrenia will address a major unmet therapeutic need by inspiring new avenues of innovative therapeutic strategies.",2017-09-01,2019-08-31,178156.8,,['PV'],1,7

This industry-demanded and market-driven Lift Energy Saving System (LESS) champions EU smart energy efficiency policies and empowers European electricity consumers to take charge of energy costs and consumption. 
Our general objective can be further developed in the next three sub-systems: 
- Product development and production of a low-cost energy recovery system.  
- A Hybrid energy storage systems with ultracapacitors and batteries that enable autonomous operation of the microgrid system.  
- Connector elements to add versatility to the system (so that other sources of micro generated energy such as solar panels or micro wind generators could simply be installed in buildings).  
As stated above this project has a big target market. Around 4.5 million lifts are currently installed in the EU. The remaining 3.2 million are medium-use elevators (found in our target residential sector) where the innovation proposed could be disruptive. This means that the new development has a target market of about 2.1M lifts in Europe. This includes only the existing lifts. According from the Elevator World Magazine, 12,000 new electric lifts were installed in Europe, representing a 10.7% increase on 2011. Although we are targeting Europe first with our technology, we believe this technology could also be marketed at the international market.   
Our overall objective for Phase 1 is to create a Feasibility Study that consists of a technological feasibility, market assessment, business model assessment, risk assessment, IPR assessment and a Business Plan.

288,774912,LeydenJar,Boosting Battery Energy Density in Electric Vehicles,"Lighter batteries will help the e-mobility sector to reach its tipping point. A lower battery weight would result in a bigger Electric Vehicle (EV) autonomy range, thus encouraging the take up of cleaner vehicles in Europe. Nowadays, many EU countries cannot afford to deploy a dense network of urban EV charging stations; as a consequence, large sectors of the EU population are excluded from the e-mobility revolution that the European Commission strongly promotes.    
In a current high-end electric car, more than a third of the weight is due to the batteries. The technology of LeydenJar improves the energy density of lithium-ion batteries 50% by volume and 33% by weight without compromising cost, safety, power density, lifetime, and cycle life. A 50% increase is huge compared with global annual improvement of 3%-5% offered nowadays. 
Our technology is based on 100% silicon-manufactured anodes produced via a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology. This process has been proved successful in the photovoltaic solar cell industry and we are the first and only (since our technology is patented worldwide) to offer it in the e-mobility domain. Our technology has the potential to be disruptive in the domain of EVs (both battery EVs and fuel cell EVs) but also the consumer electronics can be similarly interested in a 50% longer operating time, reduced weight, and smaller ecological footprint. Thus we have the long-term ambition to become a game-changing silicon anode supplier, thus contributing to the creation of a new EU industry around the production of Li-ion batteries.
The first step of this strategy is to carry out a feasibility study to verify the commercial viability of LeydenJar; this will be the overall goal of the present SME Instrument phase 1 project.",2017-04-01,2017-08-31,50000.0,['Fuel'],"['electric car', 'photovoltaic', 'fuel cell', 'electric vehicle', 'solar cell']",6,6

At the same time the industry is relying more and more on truck and bus batteries to crank and start engines as well as to run an increasing number of electrical loads. This stress imposed on batteries is one of the major causes of engine start failure with consequent delays on delivery and additional maintenance costs.
C2C was founded in 2014 to solve this problem by bringing a new Electric Double Layer Capacitor (supercapacitor) to the energy storage market, the C2C-NewCap.
This technology holds a large range of applications from Heavy Truck engine cranking and hybrid traction passenger vehicles to wind turbine pitch control or even utility grid peak shaving.
After the initial 200Kâ‚¬ research project started in 2011 funded by public sources, we have raised 210Kâ‚¬ through Venture Capital from Caixa Capital and Innoenergy. This investment allowed us to develop our technology from the lab scale to demonstration in real application conditions (TRL6).
In what concerns heavy trucks and buses we eliminate the dead-battery risks by dedicating the starting function to our supercapacitors. We have chosen transportation as our entry market due to the big need existing in the heavy transport segment, where we have a perfect fit, relevant industrial partners and few competitors from whom we differ with a patented technology that makes ours simpler to install, safer to operate, more eco-friendly, more reliable and cheaper.
The successful market application of the C2C-NewCap technology will mean more on-time deliveries, less fuel consumption, carbon emissions and air pollution and, ultimately, the end of jumper cables for trucks and buses.

290,683621,Synchronverter,Smart Synchronous inverter for gridâ€™s stability,"The integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) plays a fundamental role in the development of Smart Grids. Nowadays, RES (solar, wind, etc.) and DERs (energy storage, EV, etc.) are connected to the grid via DC/AC converters (inverters). Now, these inverters do not provide ancillary services (power-frequency control, voltage control, etc.) like the synchronous generators (generators normally used in conventional power plants) do, which is required to avoid grid voltage and frequency fluctuations and faults. Since the amount of RES and DERs installations are drastically increasing in the world, there is an urgent need to implement smart inverters with these functionalities included. The Synchronverter facilitates the connection of RES and DERs to the grid causing a conventional inverter to mimic a synchronous generator, consequently, these power sources can actively participate in the grid stabilization in harmony with other generators. The Synchronverter has been developed by Synvertec an Israeli company seed-funded by Horizon Green Tech Ventures an investment alliance formed by Alstom S.A, Rotem Industries Ltd (Isralei company specialized in the commercialisation of advanced technologies) and Gefen Investmens ( a business incubator company). Synvertec is also participated by Israel Electric Corporation (IEC - Israeli Grid Operator) and the Office of the CHief Scientist (Israeli goverrmental R&D fostering office).

The combination and unique integration of de-centralized storage with technologies for local energy system optimization, including demand response, electric vehicle charging optimization and synergies with other energy vectors at the local level, can offer a cost-efficient pathway (in comparison to high-CAPEX grid upgrade investments) for local energy systems optimization in presence of high volumes of volatile and intermittent RES, since huge amounts of currently non-utilized flexibility can be unleashed to ensure optimal congestion management and effective tackling of local instabilities and imbalances. MERLON introduces an Integrated Modular Local Energy Management Framework for the Holistic Operational Optimization of Local Energy Systems in presence of high shares of volatile distributed RES. Optimization in MERLON applies to multiple levels spanning optimal coordination of local generation, with demand and storage flexibility, as well as flexibility offered by EVs and CHP Plants to facilitate maximum RES integration, avoidance of curtailment and satisfaction of balancing/ ancillary grid needs.

292,840461,GiFlex,GridEye flexibility service to distribution systems through distributed technologies,"The European Unionâ€™s priority of increasing the penetration of renewable generation in modern distribution networks has posed many challenges. The largest share consists of distributed and small-scale systems. The increased variability of supply from distributed renewable generations such as, wind and solar photovoltaics causes frequency and voltage stability issues in the system. Moreover, the power electronic interfaces reduces the system inertia which can lead to severe frequency deviations if a proper control mechanism is not implemented. However, an energy storage system and demand response with non-dispatchable generations will reduce the variability and thus, improve the system resilience by providing energy arbitrage, frequency and voltage regulation and fast reserves which are beneficial to distribution network management. Although the small-scale distributed sources are not capable to provide these flexibility services to the distribution and transmission network operators, the aggregator in the modern distribution network enables this process. Besides, they are able to provide slow services such as peak shaving, demand side management. GiFlex tackles this aspect by proposing an optimization framework in the smart grid scenario. The objectives are: 1) to assess and implement accurate estimation of flexibility services from GridEye measurements by employing machine learning algorithms, 2) to aggregate the flexibility services from distributed sources. The DEPsys product GridEye has a target of providing services in seconds. 3) GiFlex further will address the joint provision of fast response in seconds and slower response in minutes through a co-optimization framework.

Its main benefits stem from (1) reducing up to 15% on the electricity costs, (2) decreasing the associated CO2 emissions (1.5%), (3) maximizing the self-consumption of green electrical energy (solar, wind)  locally produced, and (4) contributing to stabilize the electricity distribution networks for providers. To complement these benefits we propose two unprecedented features: (1) an Energy Storage Management module, which will maximize the self-consumption of green sources of energy from a Battery Storage Energy System and (2) a Smart Grid Integration module, which will provide a virtual charge to balance the energy demand/response of electricity providers. The existing control technologies do not include any intelligence to implement an efficiency energy plan, and are mainly focused on centralized tools which are difficult to install and entail high initial investment and labour costs. Besides, no solution enables to predict the peak demand and maximizes the self-consumption of local green electrical energy. To ensure the viability of SEMS we will assess its technical, commercial and financial feasibility and the IPR exploitation, and define our Business Plan so as to achieve the market uptake in the targeted European countries in 2020.

The transport of liquefied hydrogen (LH2) is considered as the most effective option for scaling up the hydrogen supply infrastructure. However, LH2 implies specific hazards, which are very different from those associated with the relatively well-known compressed gaseous hydrogen. Experience with LH2 in a distributed energy system is lacking.

However, algal biofuel production remains outside the realm of economic feasibility due to the energy-intensive extraction techniques and limitations in algal cultivation which requires large amounts of fertilizer. Existing commercial algal biomass production technologies are prohibitively expensive for fuel generation which represents a commercial constraint to developing competitive European algal biofuel companies. The proposed Fellowship â€“ TASAB - is a novel algal biorefinery concept, offering an environmentally-sustainable closed system integrating both thermal and biochemical conversion pathways. This concept will be able to maximize energy production from algae for achieving a net positive energy balance and to almost fully recycle nutrients to support algal large scale production and reduce the economic and environmental impacts associated with synthetic fertilizer use. TASAB will enhance and upgrade bio-oil yield and produce value-added products and biochemicals which could be sold at a premium and would offset production costs for energy generation. TASAB will enable this sector to produce cost-competitive biofuels, while creating a future-oriented sustainable economy.

Novel organic-inorganic perovskite materials for solar cells have drawn vigorous scientific interest over the past few years due to their potential low cost, high charge carrier mobility, absorption coefficient and efficiency. The two top scientific journals, Nature and Science, selected perovskites as one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in 2013.

A hybrid of microbial fuel cells (MFC) and conventional anaerobic digestion (AD), H2AD is based on a patented bioreactor and electrode architecture.  H2AD enables a 10x reduction in the time required to reduce the organic content of waste, and recover the energy via conversion to a hydrogen/methane rich biogas. 
Effluent disposal has been identified by LIE as a key restriction on the productivity and profitability of the EU agri-food and drink processing industry (a-FDPI), which is the largest EU manufacturing industry but includes 271,000 micro and small enterprises (ÂµSE). No viable micro-scale technology currently exists for disposal of effluents from ÂµSE, or is able to recover energy from these waste volumes. However, currently at TRL6/7 through extensive testing on cattle slurry, H2AD can also directly address the challenge of waste management in the a-FDPI, recovering some of the 288TWh of potential energy lost in effluent from the EU a-FDPI annually.
The overall aim of the Phase 2 project is to undertake the experimental development and field trials required to confirm predicted H2AD performance/payback for new feedstocks, derived from the a-FDPI.

In particular, micro cogeneration in the residential sector allows householders to produce their own electricity (that they can also export to the grid) and use by-product heat for heating and/or cooling, significantly reducing greenhouse emissions and saving primary energy. Their huge potential has been recognized by the EU, especially considering that householdsâ€™ consumption accounts for 25.4% of total European energy consumption. 
We at MITIS, small Belgian technological enterprise, are committed to the development of efficient and clean micro CHP systems based on gas microturbines. We present FLAMINCO, a ground-breaking micro CHP boiler system designed to replace conventional domestic boilers in households, and that can be integrated in individual/community smart grids with other renewables. With its flameless combustion and our patented high efficiency heat exchanger, it delivers 1.5kWe power output and 6.5kWth thermal power with minimal NOx and CO emissions. Moreover, innovatively based on the Inverted Brayton Cycle, it does not require highly pressurized chambers and results therefore much less expensive to manufacture than its competitors.

PEDAL will develop a disruptive PV technology where record increases in efficiency are achieved and costs dramatically reduced; 
(1) Diffuse solar radiation will be captured to produce higher efficiencies with concentration ratios over 3 in plasmonically enhanced luminescent solar concentrators (PLSC).  Current LSC efficiency achieved is 7.1%, [1].  This proposal will boost efficiency utilising metal nanoparticles (MNP) tuned to luminescent material type in LSCs, to induce plasmonic enhancement of emission (PI and team have achieved 53% emission enhancement).  MNP will be aligned to enable directional emission within the LSC (being patented by PI and team).  These are both huge steps in the reduction of loss mechanisms within the device and towards major increases in efficiency.
(2) Plasmonically enhanced luminescent downshifting thin-films (PLDS) will be tailored to increase efficiency of solar cells independent of material composition. MNP will be used, where the plasmonic resonance will be tailored to the luminescent species to downshift UV. MNP will be aligned to enable directional emission within the PLDS layer, reducing losses enabling dramatic increases in a layer adaptable to all solar cells.
(3) These novel systems will be designed, up-scaled and a building integrated component fabricated, with the ability not only to generate power but with options for demand side management. 
Previous work has been limited by quantum efficiency of luminescent species, with this breakthrough in both the use of MNP for plasmonic emission enhancement and alignment inducing directionality of emission,  will lead to efficiencies of both PLSC and PLDS being radically improved.

1.  Improved performance: 20% Lifetime Cost of Energy improvement over a conventional PTO
2.  Improved reliability: extending service intervals from less than 1 year to over 2 years
3.  Verified survivability: PTO design lifetime greater than 20 years

The results will be disseminated and exploited to maximise the benefit of this project to the ocean energy sector, and to raise investor and market confidence in the emerging tidal energy industry.

In order to verify the technology, we will conduct accelerated onshore and in-sea testing of a prototype PTO and achieve third party validation of the design and the test results. In parallel we will develop a commercialisation strategy for selling and licensing the product to tidal energy technology developers, and explore potential uses outside the tidal sector, such as wave power and marine propulsion.

Two large-scale pilot projects will be implemented in two different EU regions, in urban (Osimo) and rural (Oud-Heverlee) contexts with weak connections with national grids. These pilots will test and promote the main project concepts: Smart energy system and Local Energy Community. A Smart Energy System is defined as an approach in which smart electricity, thermal, water, gas grids etc are combined with storage technologies and coordinated to identify synergies between them towards maximization of energy independency and reduction of operation costs. The purpose is to reduce energy carbon footprint while meeting energy demands and creating real and sustainable energy islands. To achieve this both physical networks (electricity, natural gas, district heating and cooling, water) and non-physical networks (mobility and citizens/communities) have to interact in order to become a Local Energy Community where inhabitants can act and exchange energy to provide reliable and cheap energy in colaboration.

304,813232,LC-SOLAR,Low cost solar energy conversion to electricity,"Replacing fossil-fuels with solar energy in electric power generation is one of the most important challenges to humanity. From an economic point of view, the important parameter is the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), or Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), which is the net present value of the unit-cost of electricity over the lifetime of an energy generating asset. The minimally expected LCOE for any solar energy system in 2030 is 0.045 [â‚¬/kWh], similar to today's Photovoltaics (PV) LCOE, and at the same level as fossil-fuels. In this proposal, we aim to demonstrate a Proof of Concept [PoC] for a low-cost CPV operating at LCOE of 0.025 [â‚¬/kWh] (50% reduction of PVs today). The proposal is a direct continuation of our ERC project on new thermodynamic ideas for solar cells, where we demonstrated that; In contrast to thermal emission, photoluminescence (PL) rate is conserved when the temperature increases, while each photon is blue-shifted (photon-energy increased). We also demonstrated how such Thermally Enhanced-PL (TEPL) generates more energetic photons, by orders of magnitude, than thermal emission at similar temperatures. These findings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump, and can harvest thermal losses in photovoltaics with a theoretical maximal efficiency of 70%, and a practical device/solution that can reach 48% efficiency. In our preliminary unpublished work, we demonstrate 42% TEPL efficiency compared to an ideal-PV. The challenge in this PoC is to demonstrate photon recycling, photon management, and thermal management, where the maximum of the PL is converted to electricity in an operating PV. We also performed a detailed breakdown of the costs related to TEPL based device. Based on our cost analysis, achieving 32% total conversion efficiency without a cooling system supports LCOE of 0.025 [â‚¬/kWh], which will significantly accelerate the usage of renewable energy.",2018-08-01,2020-01-31,150000.0,,"['recycling', 'renewable energy', 'heat pump', 'PV']",4,6

Hydrocarbons will provide a large proportion of the worldâ€™s energy for the foreseeable future.  There is no escape from the critically low oil price worldwide. Innovation becomes important in this price environment.  â€œEasyâ€ oil has already been found; future supply will come from complex reservoirs requiring enhanced oil recovery (EOR).  There is a massive growth in renewables technology; the EU is making steady progress towards its 2020 target. The EU renewables energy share increased from 8% to 15% in the decade to 2013.  Energy supply and consumption brings with it the global issue of climate change as emissions from industry and transport increase.  Inextricably linked to energy is the reduction of the global carbon footprint and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) offers the only real technology that can handle the already produced carbon dioxide.
Corrosion in energy and environmental control linking to energy supply provide the underpinning rationale for this proposal. Corrosion is one of the major life-limiting factors for energy supply (oil and gas, renewables, EOR) and in environmental pollution control (CCS) and is estimated to cost 3% GDP.

In addition, existing CSP plants are facing troubling issues with the molten salts mega tanks, one of the core elements of their Thermal Energy Storage (TES) areas. These tanks, usually worth around â‚¬10M, are made of stainless-steel or carbon. The length of their welding cord and the increased corrosiveness of these materials at high temperatures endanger their durability. Recently, some settlements and even breakages have been reported in commercial plants, causing relevant repairing and substitution costs.
TANKRETE project, developed by InCrescendo, is aimed at tackling this problem while contributing to increase the CSP profitability. TANKRETE is a cylindrical tank with an isolating foundation system, all manufactured with patented thermal concretes. TANKRETE provides greater stability and durability to the TES area, with a significant reduction in the investment cost (35% cheaper than current tanks), plus additional 3-4% savings in a budget of â‚¬45M in salt volume. TANKRETE provides adaptability and design flexibility, as well as immediate applicability, it being compatible with current plantsâ€™ technologies. We have developed two small-scaled functional prototypes, whose long term thermal and structural stability has been successfully tested.
Based on our estimates, TANKRETE will reach by the 3rd year from launch a cumulative turnover of â‚¬63M in a turnkey business model, with a cumulative profit for us of â‚¬6.3M.

Nowadays, crop-based biofuels are also used with the same purposes, but consume huge water and land resources for their production.
Carbon Recycling International (CRI), founded in 2006 in Iceland, produces renewable methanol (currently 4 kt/year in the George Olah plant) from industrial CO2 emissions and Renewable Energy Sources (RES), through a novel process of clean fuel production (VulcanolÂ®). This proprietary technology is called Emissionsâ€“to-Liquids (ETL) and is certified ISCC Plus by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification system. While conventional production of methanol emits up to 4 t CO2/t methanol, our ETL plant fights global warming by consuming 1.4 t CO2/t of VulcanolÂ® produced and requires approximately 1500 times less land and up to 15,000 less water than crop based biofuel, eradicating ethical concerns about competition between biofuels and human food production. VulcanolÂ® is an efficient energy carrier that can be used to easily store and transport off-peak renewable energy, stabilizing the power grid and supporting expansion of RES. ETL helps to fulfil stricter EU regulations regarding the use of advanced renewable fuels and RES; improves air quality in industrial areas, thus, health of their population and employees and supports employment creation (25 skilled jobs per ETL plant). During this phase 2, CRI aims to a) scale up the technology and adapt ETL plants to economically operate with RES, b) to attract investment to build and operate ETL plants and c) to close distribution agreements for the produced VulcanolÂ®, which by 2024 will provide an annual profit of â‚¬95.4 million and an 8.2 years payback.",2019-01-01,2020-12-31,1827380.63,['Fuel'],"['biofuel', 'renewable energy', 'recycling']",4,6

Proton-exchange membrane electrolysers (PEMEL) are a mature technology that can be coupled with intermittent renewable power sources. However their wide deployment still depends on innovative breakthroughs regarding the design of alternative catalysts avoiding the use of precious metals and fulfilling three main characteristics: sustainability, cost-effectiveness and stability.

This will allow us to grow our company from our current aggregated load of 50 MW, and our turnover of â‚¬4.5 million to â‚¬43 million per year by 2022.

Electricity systems in EU countries are facing significant challenges as penetration of renewable energy (in particular wind) continues to increase to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets. Due to the intermittent and inflexible nature of renewable energy sources, efficient real-time frequency balancing of grids will become a major challenge for grid operators. A deviation of only 1 Hz from the standard grid frequency (50 Hz) can cause blackouts and power outages as the grid loses inertia, requiring grid operators to quickly add/remove load from the grid to restore balance. 

Following our success with our current smart grid optimisation system we have seen an opportunity to introduce a disruptive new system, OptiGrid, which will use Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) to allow potentially problematic changes in grid frequency to be detected and acted upon within 0.4 seconds, rather than the 10-second state of the art. As well as providing grid security, this will also allow a greater quantity of renewable energy sources to be integrated into the grid as we will be able to effectively and rapidly deliver the required frequency response performance to grid operators.   

With the frequency response market expected to see imminent high growth, our technology is well placed to take a significant proportion of this target sector.

Also, in a long term, offshore wind farms will be required to move to deeper waters (> 45m), due to the lack of suitable shallow water sites and the desire to harness better energy resources. At these depths, fixed foundations are not economically viable. For this reason, there is a clear need to approach different concepts that enable deployment in deeper waters, such as floating devices.
Floating Power Plant A/S and linked third pary Floating Power Plant Ltd (FPP), aims to pursue a major opportunity by bringing its innovative hybrid concept â€“ an offshore-proven, floating, wind and wave power plant â€“ to commercial maturity. Specifically, with POSEIDON, FPP aims to go a step further in its business strategy by overcoming the key barriers that may hinder the successful market uptake of its commercial-scale device â€“ the P80.The innovation project activities will be focused in the UK (primary target market).
P80 is based on a unique patented technology, which presents several advantages when compared with current offshore renewable concepts: facilitates deployment in deeper waters; enables higher energy yields; allows a reduction in capital costs due to shared foundations, grid infrastructure, and platform (between wind and wave); and allows a reduction in O&M costs due to its unique safe harbour. Overall this translates into a reduction of LCOE (up to â‚¬ 0.13/kWh), which is the ultimate objective of the EU offshore renewables industry in order to become competitive.

It will develop a smart and flexible, small-scale CHP unit (100-1,000 kWe) fueled with fast pyrolysis bio-oil originating from different types of biomasses and/or residues. Fast pyrolysis converts biomass into a uniform liquid intermediate called FPBO, and the process is characterized by a high feedstock flexibility. Nowadays, FPBO is produced on commercial scale in Europe. For small scale biomass CHP systems a standardized fuel, enabling optimization of the conversion units and thus creating a cost competitive value chain, is highly preferred. Moreover, to achieve high resource efficiencies at all times a highly flexible ratio between heat and power generation is desired. A smart, demand driven unit should be capable of dealing with the fluctuating energy demand and/or varying availability of wind/solar power. The SmartCHP system combines a FPBO fueled engine and flue gas boiler to produce electricity and heat at a high efficiency over the whole load range.

This flexibility cannot only come from electricity end-uses, the volatility and variability of RES generation is too high. Energy system decarbonisation will necessitate the use of novel conversion and storage in alternative energy carriers and their networks to achieve the avoidance of RES generation curtailment.

The project aims at supplying totally or partially the thermal energy requirement for CaCO3 calcination by high temperature solar heat thus reducing the life cycle environmental impacts of the process and increasing the attractiveness of renewable heating technologies in process industries. 
This will be achieved by the demonstration of a pilot scale solar reactor suitable for calcium carbonate decomposition (Calcination reaction: CaCO3 = CaO \ CO2) and to simulate at prototype scale a 24h/day industrial process (TRL 4-5) thereby requiring a high-temperature transport and storage system. The system will operate at 950Â°C and will include a 30 kWth solar reactor producing 30 kg/h CaO and a 16h hot CaO storage. Life cycle environmental impacts of the solar-based solution in comparison with standard processes will be developed as well as economic evaluation.
The project develops and merges three advanced technologies: high temperature solar reactor, transport of high-temperature solid materials and high temperature thermal storage. The synergy between these technologies lies in using the solar-treated particles as storage medium. 
The development of a such innovative technology for continuous particle processed by concentrated solar energy at about 950Â°C is unique in the world. Thanks to the solar unit integration in the industrial process (potentially combined with CO2 capture), this should result in the considerable reduction of the carbon footprint of the CO2 emitter industries and open a new market for renewable energies.",2016-01-01,2019-12-31,4366562.5,['Storage'],"['concentrated solar', 'thermal storage']",3,6

DEVULC can reclaim valuable manufacturing scrap such as tyre rubber crumb, EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer), and Silicone rubber, and it can deal with spent and used rubber materials (rubber seals, used tyres, etc.) that are sufficiently clean, and with waste (scrap cut-off) when new rubber products are manufactured create a new 100% recycled material: DEVULC TPV. 
The process is socially responsible, environmentally sustainable and economically viable. No chemical solvents are used, devulcanization takes 1 min, and there is a 99% crumb conservation. DEVULC TPV is a versatile material that can be engineered to provide a range of properties. It has a consistent quality and can be incorporated in up to 25% content for the production of new rubber products. 
DEVULC will positively impact the industrial rubber and the tyre rubber markets. It will develop a recycling method which complies with the environmental standards imposed in the EU. It results in a recycled material fully compliant with the restrictive standards for automotive industry. 
It will impact large rubber manufacturers which will built inside their installations a DEVULC recycling plant working in continuous with the rubber production chain for the recycling of the scrap cut-offs. The recycled material could be entyrely used by this large company. 
Plants located near a pole of rubber producers, to jointly manage all residues, can benefit from the scale-size effect. Technically, different lines could be operated for different rubber types. Finally, waste sorting plants could benefit from a DEVULC plant built in their facilities. With this installations, rubber cemeteries could become sources of recycled rubber, turning rubber waste management into an economically profitable activity.",2015-04-01,2017-11-30,1683200.75,['Waste management'],"['waste management', 'recycling']",3,6

In order to achieve it, PVâ€™s efficiency and its associated costs need to be improved. REPHLECT project tackles both factors thanks to an innovative combination of advanced High Concentration PV (HCPV) technology and a close to the end market model.
HCPV, due to its use of very high efficiency PV cells, is currently the solar technology with the highest cost reduction potential (85% in the last 5 years). REPHLECTâ€™s HCPV builds up on the excellent results obtained in the FP7 project â€œNGCPVâ€, in which concentrator cells, module and system efficiency were improved. Now BSQ Solar, one of NGCPVâ€™s partners, will take a step forward by designing a module that will reach a concentration of 1000X from the 820X developed by NGCPV, and at the same time including innovative features.
To reduce the associated costs, REPHLECT will design components that allow local manufacturing and will migrate assembly lines to Satellite Production Centres (SPCs) located in highly irradiated areas to produce the panels close to the market. The only most IP sensitive part, the receivers, will be developed in BSQ headquarters in Madrid.

In this sense, it is a common perception that a joint industrial effort is needed to conceive and develop highly-efficient and multifunctional energy producing construction materials, in order to provide market opportunities at a world-wide level for the European photovoltaic and construction industry value chains. This market deployment depends critically on the achievement of ambitious targets in terms of significant cost reduction, flexibility of design, high performance, reliability in the long-term, aesthetics, standardization and compliance with legal regulations. Within this context, the main objective of BIPVBOOST project is to bring down the cost of multifunctional building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems, limiting the overcost with respect to traditional, non-PV, construction solutions and non-integrated PV modules, through an effective implementation of short and medium-term cost reduction roadmaps addressing the whole BIPV value chain and demonstration of the contribution of the technology towards mass realization of nearly Zero Energy Buildings.  In order to address these global objectives and maximize the impacts, the project will optimally combine and demonstrate in real operation conditions: (i) a completely flexible and automated BIPV manufacturing and control line, (ii) a large portfolio of multifunctional BIPV products optimally integrated in the building envelope, (iii) process and energy management innovation based on digitalization and (iv) advanced standardization activities supporting the qualification of BIPV systems for a massive implementation in the building skin.",2018-10-01,2022-09-30,8844070.14,['Energy management'],"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",3,6

The development and
promotion of abundant and clean alternatives such as liquid hydrogen, liquid biomethane, nitrogen (all renewable fuels) and
LNG is becoming a necessity. These gaseous fuels are among the serious options to be considered. Hydrogen, for example,
can be produced anywhere where there is water and a source of electricity. And hydrogen-fueled vehicles emit no
greenhouse gases or other pollutants. During combustion, hydrogen produces only water vapour.
However, these fuels have significant infrastructure and transport limitations. Hydrogen is currently expensive also because
is difficult to handle and store. The same applies to fuels like LNG.
The current method of transporting LNG and other gas-based fuels like hydrogen, biomethane and nitrogen, is the cryogenic
tanker. Specialised driver/operator training, and expensive equipment is required to handle these tankerâ€”trailers and as
such, there is often limited infrastructure for them outside states with large petrochemical industries. This limited transport
infrastructure has, in turn, led to limited support infrastructure.
GGLS has developed the GBGâ„¢, lightweight composite tanks for collecting, transporting and storing cryogenic materials,
specifically gaseous fuels. These patented tanks can be used as an integral part of a system to maintain a continuous
cryogenic gas supply or as on board fuel tanks for use in road vehicles, particularly heavy trucks, coaches, buses and vans
or for rail, marine and aircraft applications.
GBGâ„¢ innovative tanks are capable of revolutionising the collection, distribution and storage at the point of use of
renewable fuels in both cryogenic and gaseous forms. Indeed, rather than transferring fuel, the GBGâ„¢ system is based on

324,705944,THERMOSTALL,"High Performance Seasonal Solar Energy Latent Heat Thermal Storage Using Low Grade, Low Melting Temperature Metallic Alloys","Energy storage technologies have long been a subject of great interest to both academia and industry. The aim of this project is to develop a novel, cost effective and high performance Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage System (LHTESS) for seasonal accumulation of solar energy in increased quantities. The major barrier for currently used Phase Change Materials (PCMs, organic and hydrated salts) is their very low heat conduction coefficient, low density, chemical instability and tendency to sub-cooling. Such inferior thermo-physical properties result in the LHTESS having large dimensions and not having a capacity to provide the necessary rate of heat re-charge and discharge, even with highly developed heat exchangers. The new approach to overcome the above issues is the deployment of low grade, eutectic low melting temperature metallic alloys (ELMTAs). The ELMTAs are currently produced for application in other areas and have not been actively considered for the thermal energy accumulation with the exception of very limited studies. Their heat conduction is two orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional PCMs, they are stable and provide the thermal storage capacity which is 2-3 times greater per unit of volume. The project consists of both theoretical and experimental investigations. A range of low grade ELMTAs for application in LHTESS will be selected and Differential Scanning Calorimetry will be used to measure their thermal properties. Thermal cycling tests of such alloys will be conducted. Numerical investigations of heat transfer and flow in the LHTESS with ELMTAs will be performed. Experimental studies of heat transfer and flow in a laboratory prototype of the LHTESS with ELMTAs will be conducted. As outcomes of investigations, dimensionless heat transfer correlations will be derived and design recommendations for a practical  solar energy seasonal LHTESS with the low grade ELMTA will be produced for project industrial partner",2016-11-01,2018-10-31,195454.8,['Storage'],"['energy storage', 'thermal storage']",3,6

Globally, over 400 million waste containers are being served by millions of trucks every day, and 50 % of the value in the market is in the logistics. Enevo is a growing Finnish technology company that aims to capitalise on this 12-billion-euro business opportunity and become the #1 supply chain platform company for waste and recycling operations worldwide.

As waste management plays a central role in the circular economy, Enevo is a key player in developing more efficient waste collection and management systems. Enevo helps its customers make their waste and recycling operations more efficient, leading to a more sustainable world. Enevoâ€™s vision is to turn all waste in the world into a valued resource.

SmartWASTE project is addressing two significant EU-wide challenges:
1) Optimising transport operations and tackling the environmental and logistical challenges that the European transport sector is facing
2) Waste management in the circular economy context.

This situation affects negatively the environment in terms of pollution and greenhouse gases emissions, as well as social perception regarding waste management, consumerâ€™s products industry and policy makers.

iCAREPLAST addresses the cost and energy-efficient recycling of a large fraction of todayâ€™s non-recyclable plastics and composites from urban waste. Heterogeneous plastic mixtures will be converted into valuable chemicals (alkylaromatic) via chemical routes comprising sequential catalytic and separation steps. This multistage process will also yield carbon char and a pure CO2 stream as products, whilst it will present improved economic sustainability, operational flexibility and lower CO2 footprint thanks to (i) the energetic valorisation of gas by-products through innovative oxycombustion units integrated with efficient heat recovery; and (ii) the use of AI predictive control and real time optimisation. iCAREPLAST aims to demonstrate (TRL-7) the whole technology for plastic waste valorisation in a pilot plant able to process >100 kg/h of plastic. Advanced upstream waste sorting, pre-treatment and pyrolysis is strongly backed by previous demonstration activities and knowhow of the consortium, with profound knowledge of waste management and recycling market.

iCAREPLAST solution will enforce circular economy by substantially increasing the amount of recycled plastics to produce commodity products that can be used for virgin-quality polymers production or as raw materials for other processes in petrochemicals, fine chemicals, automotive and detergent/surfactants industries.

The core of this project is the application of an innovative technology, recently developed and proved successfully at pilot scale in Iceland, which can limit the production of emissions from geothermal plants by condensing and re-injecting gases or turning the emissions into commercial products. To both increase public acceptance and to generalise this approach, it will be applied by GECO in four distinct geothermal systems in four different European countries: 1) a high temperature basaltic reservoir in Iceland; 2) a high temperature gneiss reservoir in Italy; 3) a high temperature volcano-clastic reservoir in Turkey; and 4) a low temperature sedimentary reservoir in Germany. Gas capture and purification methods will be advanced by lowering consumption of resources, (in terms of electricity, water and chemicals) to deliver cheaper usable CO2 streams to third parties. Our approach to waste gas storage is to capture and inject the soluble gases in the exhaust stream as dissolved aqueous phase. This acidic gas-charged fluid provokes the dissolution of subsurface rocks, which increases the reservoir permeability, and promotes the fixation of the dissolved gases as stable mineral phases. This approach leads to the long-term environmentally friendly storage of waste gases, while it lowers considerably the cost of cleaning geothermal gas compared to standard industry solutions. A detailed and consistent monitoring program, geochemical analysis, and comprehensive modelling will allow characterising the reactivity and consequences of fluid flow in our geologically diverse field sites letting us create new and more accurate modelling tools to predict the reactions that occur in the subsurface in response to induced fluid flow. Finally, gas capture for reuse will be based on a second stage cleaning of the gas stream, through amine separation and burn and scrub processes, producing a CO2 stream with H2S levels below 1 ppm, which is the prerequisite for most utilisation pathways such as the ones that will be applied within the project.",2018-10-01,2022-09-30,15599842.88,['Storage'],"['geothermal', 'geothermal energy']",3,6

However, single junction photovoltaic (PV) cells fail to achieve their theoretical efficiency due to an inability to harness all wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Spectral losses may be overcome through the addition of a spectral converter coating to the surface of a finished PV cell, which, through a photoluminescence process, converts solar photons into wavelengths suitable for use. Nonetheless, spectral converters currently fail to deliver their promise to significantly boost PV cell performance due to the difficulties of translating luminescent molecules (lumophores) from solution into efficient solid-state materials.

By considering the lumophore-host material as an integrated unit, rather than discrete components, in SPECTRACON, I take a radically new approach to the design of spectral converters. Organic-inorganic hybrid polymer hosts incorporating covalently-grafted lumophores will be rationally engineered to deliver spectral converters with the tailored optical, structural, viscoelastic and mechanical properties needed for high performance solid-state conversion, which has so far been unattainable. Using cheap materials and a solution-based process suitable for scalable manufacturing, these spectral converters will be integrated with PV cells to realise next generation luminescent solar devices which display record levels of efficiency and reduced costs.

A scientific breakthrough that demonstrates efficient solar spectral conversion in the solid-state would enable immediate deployment of luminescent solar devices to the commercial market, thus accelerating progress to an all-renewables society and delivering unprecedented impact on the quality of life of future generations.

In bioenergy production the solid fuel quality and especially moisture content and share of foreign matter are the key parameters. The water content of the fuel is a parameter used in the regulations of some manufacturers to manage the settings of a biomass boiler. But it is also essential for verifying energy content of the fuel delivered to the power plant which is base for fuel pricing. Solid biofuels often contains foreign matter such as stones, sand, soil and also metals that lowers energy content and increases operation and maintenance costs in the power plant. High moisture content and amount of foreign matter in biofuels increases operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for the whole production chain.
Current practise of biofuel quality control is based mainly on manual sampling and laboratory analysis method which is uncertain and requires a lot of manual work.  Inrayâ€™s technology that enables solid biofuels online quality data that can be used in optimizing power plantâ€™s processes. 

Specific objectives for this feasibility study are: End-user survey, Partner search, IPR survey and Elaborated Business plan development.",2014-10-01,2015-01-31,50000.0,['Fuel'],"['biofuel', 'renewable energy']",3,6
336,829877,HiVOLT,HIGH-VOLTAGE LITHIUM STORAGE - secure + efficient battery storage solution of the next generation,"The share of renewable energies such as wind and solar energy, which is fed into the electricity grids, is constantly
increasing worldwide. This type of energy is highly volatile, and depending on the time of day and the weather they supply
different amounts of energy. This causes two problems: 1. the energy grids are being burdened more and more - the
blackout danger is growing! 2. The electricity is not available as required. That is why we need a highly flexible system in the
future to compensate these fluctuations, to be able to guarantee a secure energy network and the provision of electricity on
demand. Technologically, battery storages can provide this flexibility, but the price/performance ratio is still the biggest
obstacle for a full market penetration.
HiVOLT describes a newly developed battery system based on high-voltage technology, which offers significant cost and
efficiency advantages compared to conventional systems. Savings are achieved, among other things, by eliminating
transformers and reducing system costs through lower currents. The impact of the technology is outstanding and has the
potential to revolutionize the storage market. This is reflected in the outstanding economic efficiency of the high-voltage
lithium storage. It is at least 33% higher compared to TESLA, BYD, E3DC and results from the following factors:
Higher number of charge cycles (8,000), max. depth of discharge, higher energy efficiency (92%), low investment costs (570
â‚¬/kWh) and low system costs (50% reduction).
In SME Phase 2, the product is to be made ready for series. Serial production and commercialization are to be carried out.
Commercial enterprises in i.a. Europe, East Asia and USA are to be reached (market size: 1.1 bn â‚¬). The high-voltage

While significant efforts have been made into the developing accurate forecasts, much work remains to integrate the forecasting in the electric system operations. The successful incorporation of forecasts into grid operation emerges as an important challenge. Accurate photovoltaic (PV) generation forecasts are major themes of the research roadmap of many international task forces, as Smart Grids SRA 2035 to support the flexibility increasing of the power systems. In this context, the project aims to support large scale integration of PV systems in countries with a high solar resource and a significant potential of small capacity PV systems such as Greece.

(a) relatively unproven, 
(b) expensive and 
(c) have yet to gain the confidence of the market. 

In this project we will address these three barriers by demonstrating a prototype turbine incorporating our novel Direct Drive generator at a real-world tidal site.

Our goal in this project is to reduce the lifetime cost of tidal energy by 20%. Outputs will be independently verified, and will demonstrate improved efficiency, improved reliability and lower maintenance costs. The results will be disseminated to raise investor and market confidence in the emerging tidal energy industry.

There are some studies found in the literature to predict the performance of this fuel cell using one and two-dimensional single phase models. The validation of these models was done using the experimental test results for the membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) built with conventional materials. In this project, the main objective is to develop a high performance FE-DMFC stack through modeling and experimental studies. For this purpose, a three-dimensional and two-phase multiphysics model, which includes all the transport phenomena in all the layers, will be developed to predict the performance of the FE-DMFC stack accurately. To validate this model, a FE-DMFC stack based on alternative MEA materials (i.e. materials having lower cost, and higher stability and reaction kinetics) will be manufactured in-house in cooperation with the partner organization in Europe. After validating this model, the effect of significant design and operating parameters of the stack on the output parameters will be investigated; thus the parameters that increase the performance of this fuel cell mostly will be determined. This project will have have a very positive impact in Dr. Colpan's career as it will help him to develop lasting integration with his institution and increase his network in Europe. The knowledge and results gained as a result of the research conducted during this project will be shared with other researchers, scientists, and general public through several activities (e.g. conference, seminar, and papers in the journals, webpage, and visiting schools).

344,731285,SHAR-Q,Storage capacity sharing over virtual neighbourhoods of energy ecosystems,"Storages are unavoidable components of the future smart grid with large share of variable renewable generation. However, the unit-cost of energy, that is retrieved from storages, is several times higher than the cost of energy consumed upon its output from RES. Therefore, there is a strong requirement on the optimisation of storage capacities deployed in the grid. This is especially true for the small energy sites such as DER and prosumersâ€™ microgrids which are the segments, targeted by the SHAR-Q bottom-up concept.  

The principal objective of the SHAR-Q is to optimize the storage capacities deployed in the grid with the help of a peer-to-peer interoperability network that connects neighbourhooding RES\Storage ecosystems into a collaboration framework. Thus, the optimization of storage capacities can be achieved through their sharing among the participating actors. To get connected to the SHAR-Q network, an open interoperability gateway with semantic interface descriptors will be provided that will be based on the most adopted standards in the field. Moreover, the users will be provided with an ability to manage their contribution to the collaborative models on their own in a way that resembles the well-known social web portals (e.g. users can control with whom they wish to share specific storage capacities). 

The viability of the collaborative business models will be proven through added-value services, deployed over the SHAR-Q interoperability network, that will be demonstrated in 3 different pilots, targeting 3 different segments of end-users such as neighborhoods of distributed RES, coalitions of prosumers and locations with e-vehicle charging stations.

Project AMPYXAP3 concerns the design, construction and testing of the first article of an initial commercial PowerPlane, version AP3.

The global transition to a sustainable energy supply is burdened by the exorbitant societal costs associated with it. Renewable energy infrastructure projects have extremely high capital costs, and in most cases the cost per kWh of renewable electricity produced exceeds the cost of fossil-fuelled alternatives, thus requiring subsidies or other supportive instruments from governments. The economic effects of the energy transition are very significant, including the deterioration of international competitive position of countries or regions with high ambition levels regarding climate change, such as the EU â€“ caused by rising electricity prices for industry. PowerPlane technology will have a disruptive effect on the electricity generation sector; due to the low levelised cost of energy (LCoE) that can be achieved with it, and due to its low capital costs.

The need for a low cost, low capital investment renewable energy technology is evident. The AP3 PowerPlane, to be developed in the AMPYXAP3 project, fulfils the customer need of PowerPlane technology demonstration in long-term continuous safe operation at costs and LCoE as predicted.

Ampyx Power aspires to manufacture and sell PowerPlane systems, as well as deliver operational and maintenance services to wind park owners.

The combination of these extraordinary properties makes of graphene a unique material. However, what really makes of graphene a huge promise under a macroeconomic perspective is that graphene in essence is carbon; one of the most
abundant elements in earth. This is why graphene has attracted a huge social, economic and industrial interest over the last years and this is why some sources predict that graphene will become the responsible of the next technological revolution.
However, the current methods for production of graphene-based materials require from multistep chemical transformations, making their industrial production completely unfeasible and very expensive. Therefore, the use of these materials in real energy storage devices is prevented nowadays.

Considering the improved performance, the effective cost is actually reduced. Furthermore, the printing solution facilitates scaling up during commercialisation.

Notwithstanding extensive R&D efforts, the cost and energy demand the production process remain too high, particularly in downstream processing. We believe the efficiency of microalgae downstream processing can be greatly improved through the use of nanotechnology. Hybrid and/or multifunctional nanoparticles can be tailored with multiple functional groups to combine several unit operations in a single technology. In this project, we combine expertise on Fe3O4 nanomaterials and cell disruption technologies from the experienced researcher with expertise of the two co-supervisors in nanocellulose materials and microalgae harvesting to create a bio-based and re-usable Cellulose Magnetic Hybrid (CMH) nanomaterial for downstream processing of microalgae. As a basis we will use nanocellulose, a natural material that can easily be grafted with multiple functional groups. The nanocellulose will be equipped with quaternary ammonium groups to generate flocculating and cell disruption activity, as well as pH-responsive to allow detachment of the nanomaterial after processing. The nanocellulose will be linked to an Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which will allow separating the microalgal biomass from the medium as well as recovery of the nanomaterial after downstream processing. Thus, our CMH nanomaterial will be capable of combined flocculation, dewatering and cell disruption of microalgae and can be removed from the biomass and re-used after processing. The techno-economic feasibility of this novel technology will be demonstrated in two model systems: lipid production in Nannochloropsis and astaxanthin production in Haematococcus. We believe that this CMH nanomaterial will be able to achieve a critical cost reduction in microalgal downstream processing and truly advance large-scale microalgae biomass production  towards commercialization",2017-08-02,2019-08-01,160800.0,,"['nanomaterial', 'biofuel']",2,6
355,867453,ParaResWEC,Nonlinear Rock and Roll - Modelling and Control of Parametric Resonance in Wave Energy Converters,"The title of this project is â€˜Nonlinear Rock and Roll â€“ Modelling and Control of Parametric Resonance in Wave Energy Convertersâ€™.  The over-arching aim is to catalyse increased research into parametric resonance (PR) within wave energy and other offshore renewable energy fields. 

The concept of resonance is well known in the study of wave energy converters (WECs). In comparison, PR has received virtually no attention, and is often unexpected since it is a nonlinear phenomenon not predicted by the linear/frequency domain models traditionally favoured in WEC research and analysis. Whereas normal resonance causes the oscillations of a system to grow linearly with time, PR causes an exponential increase in oscillation amplitude, and therefore has great potential to be either detrimental or beneficial to a WEC performance. For certain classes of WECs, PR can lead WEC instability and decreased performance, by transferring energy from the primary mode of motion into other modes. Alternatively, for other types of WECs designed to extract power from the parametrically resonating modes of motion, triggering PR could result in increased energy capture and represent a game-changing approach to improving WEC performance.

To achieve the over-arching goal, the project focuses on the following  specific objectives:
1) Demonstrate novel control techniques to either mitigate or harness PR for different classes of WECs.  
2) Provide opensource tools for modelling and analysing PR in WECs, to aide the wave energy community in overcoming the barriers surrounding the advanced nonlinear methods required to investigate PR.  
3) Strong communication, dissemination and exploitation activities.

356,838508,THERM,Transport of Heat in hEteRogeneous Media,"Geothermal represents a promising energy source to satisfy the growing energy needs with only minimal environmental impacts. To develop and test new technologies for energy production and storage in geothermal reservoirs, deep understanding of heat transport in fractured media is critically needed. The THERM project focuses on the investigation of heat transport and associated thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes occurring during the lifetime of a geothermal reservoir. Fractured reservoirs, such as those found in enhanced geothermal systems, are characterized by a strong hydraulic and transport complexity coming from the fracturesâ€™ surface roughness, from their arrangement in networks, and from the interaction of the fractures with the surrounding rocks. As a result, the characteristics of the hydro-thermal flow which occurs when a cold fluid is injected into a hot fractured rock mass are controlled by fracture network discontinuities and properties of fracture surfaces themselves. While progresses have been made in characterizing and modeling subsurface heterogeneity in flow and solute transport processes, the effects of multi-scale subsurface heterogeneities on heat transport remains an open question. I propose new 3D fully coupled physical-based numerical models at different scales associated to state-of-the-art field experiments to develop a quantitative understanding of complex coupled processes occurring along fluid-rock interfaces during fluid circulation in geothermal systems. The main objectives are (i) to characterize the combined effect of fracture-scale and network-scale heterogeneity on flow and heat transport phenomena, and (ii) to design new field experiment to jointly measure the integrated THM behavior of fractures. Thanks to THERM, the ER will receive a unique multidisciplinary scientific training by Rennes 1 University that will reinforce significantly her expertise for future research activities and open new perspectives for career.",2020-09-01,2022-08-31,196707.84,['Storage'],['geothermal'],2,6

Thus, developing new solar energy harvesting solutions with enhanced performance is essential. Silicon (Si) devices currently dominate 90% of the PV market share and have a standard operational efficiency (Î·) of 20-25%. To boost this performance, researchers are fabricating multijunction solar cells, i.e. introducing a tuneable-bandgap perovskite PV material on top of the Si. By creating this dual junction device, the practical Î· jumps to 30-35%, dramatically reducing the cost/Watt of the existing commercialized technologies. Yet, little is known about how the electrical and optical properties of the perovskite and Si layers influence one another or whether the present microscale pyramidal patterning of Si needs to be re-optimised for multijunction architectures.

The main objective in this project is to probe the optoelectronic interactions of next-generation PV devices to capture the intricate optical interplay between the perovskite and Si. By leveraging the Researcherâ€™s expertise in implementing/conducting functional microscopy experiments, the Host will learn cutting-edge techniques based on scanning probe and optical microscopes. Meanwhile, working with Dr. Sam Stranks at the University of Cambridge offers an unparalleled opportunity for the Researcher to acquire knowledge about novel optical spectroscopy imaging methods as well as perovskite device synthesis. Researching at Cambridge will also encourage international collaborations with world-renowned scientists.

Current manufacturing processes rely on manual work that has substantial limits in terms of cycle times, costs and scalability. Developments will start with the re-design and optimization of two key components: the media supply unit and the tank valve regulator. Both are components that are currently difficult to manufacture and are perceived as bottlenecks in the production process. Based on these new designs, an integrated production line will be planned using simulation tools. These tools will enable the evaluation of different layouts, part flow strategies and for different production scenarios. In terms of manufacturing tools, the end of line test will be improved to reduce cycle times by a factor of 3 and assistance systems for assembly stations will be developed that will enable scalability by reducing the need for training of workers. The overall target is to reduce the cycle time for production of a whole fuel cell system from 15 hours to less than 2.5 hours. Data gathering and analysis methods will be developed to enable the tracking of parts through the production line and - through a correlation of process and quality data - the continuous improvement of the production process.
Demonstration of the end of line test and the assistance system will be done in hardware. The whole production line will be evaluated using a simulation tool that has been verified on the current production process. A set of engineering samples of the re-designed tank valve regulator and the media supply unit  will be produced and used for tests of the integrated fuel cells and for assessment of the whole production process.A potential of 250 new jobs in manufacturing of fuel cells and for production of the key components will be generated by the project.",2017-02-01,2020-01-31,3286068.75,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,6

The rechargeable battery technology is based on cost-effective materials, such as zinc and manganese, which are non-polluting, safe and abundant in nature. The device comprises a zinc anode, a patented manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode and an aqueous solution of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) as electrolyte. Its architecture is simple, does not require maintenance and the battery is non-polluting, non-toxic, non-acid, non-corrosive, non-explosive.

Lithium Ion batteries (LIBs) are currently dominating the energy storage market, as they are to date best performing devices in terms of energy storage capability (energy density). However, LIBs are still facing challenges because they lack of a high power density, meaning these devices have long charging/discharging cycles. This issue is especially important in view of efficiently exploiting renewable energies and especially for supplying the required energy to power electric vehicles (when high energy inputs are required in a very short time). As alternative, supercapacitors emerge as alternative to Lithium Ion batteries because these devices can provide high energy inputs in just a matter of seconds because of their high power density. Nevertheless, in contrast with LIBs, supercapacitors cannot accumulate enough energy to supply during a long time (they have a low energy density). For these reasons, supercapacitors and LIBs are being used as complements one of each other in those highly energy demanding applications. In view of the rapid market entrance of electric vehicles and the big pressure towards using alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, the energy sector is facing an increased need for solutions to enhance the power density of LIBs and to improve the energy density of supercapacitors. The solution to achieve these improvements is the development of new and better performing electrode materials, as the performance of electrochemical devices mostly relies on the properties of the electrodes integrating them.",2015-02-01,2015-07-31,50000.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,6

Current commercial micro-turbines operate on average only 20% of the time being unable to work at wind speeds less than 4m/s. This result has given micro-wind turbines an inefficient and undesirable reputation, and they are now scarcely recommended by suppliers as they cannot guarantee their payback time.

The patented Briareo polymeric blade has been designed by applying high quality aerodynamic principles to operate in both lift and drag modes according to the specific wind, being especially performing in winds lower than 4m/s. The SME proponents have eventually developed their own turbine which in tests has exhibited a rotational capacity 4x that of current turbines. The Briareo micro-wind turbine is based on the â€œIkeaâ€ concept: it can be purchased of the shelf, easily self-assembled and installed without needs for certification, not imposing greatly on its residency (smaller than 100cmx150cm) or producing much noise. The high manufacturability of Briareo allows the use of the low cost rotational moulding industrial process.

However large scale CHP plants (>10MWe) require large investments while technologies used for small scale CHP (<50kWe) are experiencing problems with scalability due to issues related to tar removal. This has created a strong market demand for small-to-medium scale (0,1MWe-3MWe) solutions. The main objective of the planned project is to develop a CHP unit in the 250-1500kWe range using the GasEK gasification reactor that would allow to use local biomass for producing heat and electricity. GasEK has the necessary level of innovation to dominate the market in the selected power range. At the heart of the development is a patented central nozzle system which makes it possible to develop larger gasifiers producing low tar level wood gas that has not been possible before. The unique aspect of the patented solution is the Electrical Control Unit with smart-control software giving the solution a distinct competitive advantage. As a result GasEK will offer a reliable and cost-effective CHP plant for distributed energy production using local biomass. Levelized Cost of Energy of 40EUR/MWh and 3 times lower payback than the current benchmark guarantee it a strong market advantage.

This is the case of many EU States. Because of issues related to decreasing ore grades and scarcity of supply of primary metal forms, recycling of above-ground deposits of metal-bearing waste (or â€œin-use stockâ€) will become an increasingly important means of securing resources to provide essential building blocks to the European industry. Recycling of metal in-use stock has the further potential of avoiding consuming the large amounts of energy required in primary metal production, and of reducing related greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, however, because of metal losses during and after use, end-of-life recycling rates for many metals are often very low, so the potential for improving those recycling efficiencies is an important consideration for the achievement of a more resource efficient economy and sustainable development in Europe. 
This project proposes a comprehensive, exemplary research line that merges complementary drivers in the assessment of the metal-energy-climate change nexus for (i) estimating the size of current urban mines for selected, critical metals; (ii) assessing future opportunities and barriers to their recycling, and (iii) related potentials for carbon emissions reduction. The results of this project are expected to reach a wide impact in the research community and will timely inform an evidence base for future decision-making, and for enhancing the growth of European economy improving resource efficiency and recycling.

This technology is likely to provide much better control of the enhanced flow paths around a geothermal well and does not involve the amount of fluid as conventional hydraulic fracturing, reducing the risk of induced seismicity considerably. RJD shall be applied to access and connect high permeable zones within geothermal reservoirs to the main well with a higher degree of control compared to conventional stimulation technologies.

Laboratory tests will include the determination of parameters such as elastic constants, permeability and cohesion of the rocks as well as jetting experiments into large samples in. Samples will be investigated in 3D with micro CT scanners and with standard microscopy approaches. In addition, advanced modelling will help understand the actual mechanism leading to the rock destruction at the tip of the water jet.

Waste LAB recycling rates are as high as 95% in Europe, but the current recycling process â€“ smelting waste LABs in a furnace â€“ consumes vast quantities of energy, is highly polluting, wasteful, large scale and expensive. Furthermore, smelted lead must be further processed to produce the essential LAB ingredient: the active lead oxide paste. A new lead recycling process is needed that is energy efficient, non-polluting, low cost, scalable and produces LAB-ready lead products. Such process would meet EC priorities by addressing resource efficiency, the sustainable supply of raw materials and drive the circular economy. AEL has developed a novel hydrometallurgical process technology to recycle waste LABs in a highly energy efficient, non-polluting and cost effective way. NUOVOpbâ€™s commercial appeal lies in its low cost and scalability, and our ground-breaking ability to produce LAB-ready products that exceed the performance of current products on the market. Our LAB-ready paste can create new LABs with 22% greater energy capacity and 50% longer life.  The technology has the potential to transform the global battery recycling industry, which has an expected value of â‚¬9.5 billion in 2024. 5 years post project, we expect to be operating 18 NUOVOpb facilities across the world.

Placing the entire server in our dielectric fluid bath radically reduces data centre energy consumption from todayâ€™s industry average of 1.7 mPUE right down to 1.03 mPUE (see proposal for an explanation of mPUE). We are effectively developing the next generation data centre configuration.
With initial investments, we have successfully completed two major prototypes, the latest of which is fully functioning in an operational data centre. Extensive trial data has proved industry disrupting power consumption and functionality at TRL7. Our pricing and market feasibility also shows a clear opportunity to become leaders in the $ 7.12B data centre cooling market. We are requesting SME Instrument Phase 2 funding to finalise all needed functionality for initial clients and prepare for mass production. We propose to make key enhancements to our current full-scale prototype, whilst validating performance through 3 customer pilots and pre-sales activities. By 2022, we expect to sell over 600 SmartPods with revenues of 36.5 M â‚¬ and creating 92 skilled jobs.",2018-03-01,2020-02-29,1337305.38,,['data centre'],1,6

Increasing recycling rates is crucial for the implementation of a circular economy as clearly stated in the EU Plastic Strategy. NONTOX focuses on the removal of hazardous and undesired substances from plastic waste taking into account the whole value chain: sorting and pre-treatment techniques, recycling technologies but also post-treatment techniques. Valorisation of by-products and removed substances is also considered to enhance potential applications. NONTOX will target material recovery of plastics originating from WEEE, ELV and C&DW streams containing hazardous additives or undesired compounds such as flame-retardants, stabilizers, fillers,  etc. Main secondary plastic outputs will include for example, ABS, EPS, PS, HIPS, PE, PP. The market for these polymers is massive as together they represent about half of the EU demand for plastics and yet a significant portion of these valuable plastics is landfilled or incinerated. NONTOX will further develop two different technologies (Extruclean and CreaSolvÂ®) to remove hazardous substances from aforementioned plastic waste streams, allowing for increased recycling rates. NONTOX will also improve knowledge and state of the art concerning pre-treatment and sorting of plastic waste containing hazardous substances. Thermochemical conversion of non-target plastics and side streams from the main recycling processes will be investigated to increase system efficiency by integration and widen the range of final products and applications. NONTOX is conceived by a multidisciplinary consortium including internationally renowned RTOs, universities, key industrial partners and recyclers as well as product design experts.",2019-06-01,2022-05-31,4998076.25,,['recycling'],1,6
373,816636,EGREMPLARE,The first eco-friendly technology for greasy mixed plastics recycling,"Owing to their combination of unrivaled properties and low cost, plastics are the workhorse material of the modern economy. While delivering many benefits, the current plastics economy has drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. The primary problem is the high material waste rate and poor closed-loop recycling in plastics manufacturing. Today, just 14% of plastics are used for recycling. To cope this problem, the European Commission has tried to implement increasingly stringent regulations, such as reducing landfilling or incineration, by increasing the taxes for waste disposal and promoting recycling. Nevertheless, the current inefficient recycling technologies make plastics recycled uncompetitive as raw material for many plastics converters. At TUSTI. BV. (Eindhoven, Netherlands) we have developed a smart solution to overcome these barriers. EGREMPLARE high-tech recycling process is a novel process that makes recycling of mixed plastics possible, allowing to increase to 60-85% the collected plastics to be recycled. We use our proprietary cleaning process that uses a bio-based material without not generation of new waste streams and with a low energy consumption. Companies have to pay less than landfilling taxes, contributing to the achievement of objectives set by the European Commission and reducing disposal cost. Since our foundation in 2015, we have invested over 350,000 euros to develop pilots tests, the bio-based cleaner, and process improvements. Now, based on the good results of our system, we aim to speed-up the technology to introduce our solution in the plastic recycled market. This market with such growth potential (predicted to increase at 6% CAGR up to 2022 reaching â‚¬42B), could greatly benefit from our eco-friendly and low-energy solution.

With the increase in the amount of PET wastes, its disposal began to pose serious economic and environmental problems; current PET waste disposal options include incineration, landfilling and recycling. Landfilling and incineration are outdated processes, their environmental impact is high and the dependency from crude oil is critical. Recycling is the preferred option for the treatment of waste PET: plastics must be a resource and their recycling is the only way to make sustainable the plastic production chain in Europe without loss of material.
The recycling of PET does not only serve as a partial solution to the solid waste problem but also contributes to the conservation of raw petrochemical products and energy.
The proposed project aims at implementing an industrial plant to produce high quality PET through the chemical recycling of PET wastes (icluding opaque & multi-layer) and promotes true sustainable development of PET production enabling virtually endless PET re-use.
Garboâ€™s chemical recycling technology represents a novel and industrial applicable technology for the transformation of PET based wastes in monomer (BHET) that can be purified and re-used in the production of PET as raw material instead of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), with enormous advantage for the polyester value chain in terms of competitiveness and jobs creation.

The innovation is based on the patented heat exchanger made from thin stainless steel sheet. This unique element serves as a core for all processes within a full-cycle hybrid system, including heating, cooling, waste heat recuperation, and energy storage. Using same element for multiple purposes allows customers significantly reduce investments, shorten payback time and increase ROI. For most of objects the payback time is 3-5 years, which is by far the industry record.
The system has already been piloted in Finland, Estonia, Czech RepubliÑ, Poland, Malta, Ukraine and Russia for a variety of objects including private houses, industrial plants, spas and multi-story buildings. The system is easily scalable and can be supplied both to B2C and B2B markets. However, so far PolarSol has paid little attention on focusing marketing and sales effort in order to attract as diverse customer base as possible. The diversity has provided us better opportunity to test different system modifications. One of the main goals of the project is to identify customer segments with the highest market potential with special emphasis on B2B market. This goal will be pursued in Phase 1 by means of market surveys and thorough analysis of available options.

Butanol is one of the most promising biofuels due to its superior fuel properties compared to current main biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel. In addition to its ability to reduce carbon emissions, its higher energy content (almost 30% more than ethanol), its ability to blend with both gasoline and diesel, its lower risk of separation and corrosion, its resistance to water absorption, allowing it to be transported in pipes and carriers used by gasoline, it offers a very exciting advantage for adoption as engines require almost no modifications to use it.  

The main WASTE2FUELS innovations include:

â€¢    Development of novel pretreatment methods for converting AFW to an appropriate feedstock for biobutanol production thus dramatically enlarging current available biomass for biofuels production
â€¢    Genetically modified microorganisms for enhancing conversion efficiencies of the biobutanol fermentation process
â€¢    Coupled recovery and biofilm reactor systems for enhancing conversion efficiencies of Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation
â€¢    Development of new routes for biobutanol production via ethanol catalytic conversion

The focus of the technology demonstration plant is to prove the functional capability of the plant concept, followed by detailed characterization and optimization of the integration of both subsystems. The main objective is to move the technology beyond the state of the art to TRL 4.
Electrical efficiencies of more than 60% and total thermal efficiencies of more than 90% are intended to reach at base load conditions. An operational flexibility ranging from 25% to 100% electric power should be achieved. The emission levels should not exceed 10 ppm NOx and 20 ppm CO (at 15% vol. residual oxygen).

Reversible heat pumps and chillers will be used to exchange heat with the DHC network on the demand side. In this way, the same network can provide contemporary heating and cooling.
FLEXYNETS solutions will integrate effectively multiple generation sources (including high- and low-temperature solar thermal, biomass, PV, cogeneration and waste heat) where they are available along the DHC network, by managing energy at different temperature levels and assuring optimized exergy exploitation.
Together with storages, control strategies that optimize the harvest of renewable energy sources are key from the technical and economic points of view. On the one hand, strategies will be assessed that assure a thermal balance among diffused heat generation, storage and utilization. On the other, policies will be elaborated to decide when energy is to be gathered locally or exchanged (both purchased and sold) with the electricity and gas networks.
The optimal management of such new generation networks will lead to a synergic effect on primary energy savings (hence on the reduction of the CO2 emissions), assuring at the same time investment and operation profitability.

Utonomy, a British/German SME, is developing a novel, cost-effective smart grid technology that monitors and controls gas pressure, flow & gas quality by means of cloud-based, algorithm-driven hardware that can be easily installed without the need for any changes in the gas infrastructure. Utonomy has already developed a pressure management application that helps utilities reduce gas leakage to TRL 6, with the first field pilots planned for January 2018. However, during development work and in the course of discussions with future customers, Utonomy discovered that pressure management has even more commercial potential when applied to increase the grid feed-in capacity of biomethane plants.

Low carbon intensity methanol production with CRI technology reduces carbon emissions by more than 90% compared to fossil fuels. ETL is a sustainable process of renewable fuel production which has no impact on our food chain or land use. Methanol produced by CRI can also be directly used in the chemical industry for the manufacturing of sustainable goods such as paints and plastics.
CRI aims to up-scale its current plant scale and offer a standard, modular ETL plant design with nominal 50.000 t/yr methanol production capacity. The improved ETL technology achieved with the current innovation project, will enable CRI to efficiently operate using variable power sources or stranded energy assets. One of the defining characteristics of renewable power sources such as wind and solar is their interment and variable production levels. High capacity factor production sites are often untapped or under-utilized due to the lack of adequate transmission line access or capacity. CRI will provide a means to valorise under utilized renewable energy sources.

Optimisation of the kesterite bulk properties together with redesign and optimization of the device interfaces and the cell architecture will be developed for the achievement of a challenging increase in the device efficiency up to 18% at cell level and targeting 16% efficiency at mini-module level, in line with the efficiency targets established at the SET Plan for 2020. These efficiencies will allow initiating the transfer of kesterite based processes to pre-industrial stages. These innovations will give to STARCELL the opportunity to demonstrate CRM free thin film PV devices with manufacturing costs â‰¤ 0.30 â‚¬/Wp, making first detailed studies on the stability and durability of the kesterite devices under accelerated test analysis conditions and developing suitable recycling processes for efficient re-use of material waste. The project will join for the first time the 3 leading research teams that have achieved the highest efficiencies for kesterite in Europe (EMPA, IMRA and IREC) together with the group of the world record holder David Mitzi (Duke University) and NREL (a reference research centre in renewable energies worldwide) in USA, and AIST (the most renewed Japanese research centre in Energy and Environment) in Japan. These groups have during the last years specialised in different aspects of the solar cell optimisation and build the forefront of kesterite research.

Consequently, large investments are needed for storing solar energy from summer season to dark winter time. The widely available combined heat and power plants and heating networks should be utilized effectively also in the future energy system. In addition to these challenges, decarbonisation of the transport sector requires massive production of renewable fuels especially for the heavy duty sector: air traffic, ships, heavy duty road vehicles. FLEXCHX project is aiming to present a cost-effective solution to tackle these challenges of the new European energy mix.

Principal ideas of the proposal are:
-  A hybrid process that integrates electrolysis to biomass gasification and synthesis is developed and the key enabling technologies of this process are validated to reach TRL5.
-  In summer season renewable fuel intermediate (FT-wax) is produced from biomass carbon boosted with solar energy driven electrolysis. A small amount of by-product heat is also produced to cover the summer-time demand for district heating. Biomass consumption is halved compared to the winter time operation and 50 % of the input energy comes from low-cost excess electricity.
- In winter season the plant is operated without the electrolyzer in a way that biomass conversion to liquid fuel intermediate,  heat and electricity is maximized.
- Most of the invested plant components are in full use throughout the year, only the electrolysis unit is operated seasonally

Behind FLEXCHX there is a multi-national consortium composed of RTD organizations, industry and SMEs representing the entire value chain.

One of the most promising large-scale electrical storage technologies are Redox Flow Battery (RFB) systems, which can convert electrical energy to chemical energy and back again. Here the electrolyte is an electro-active species where the chemical energy is converted to electricity in a flow cell. RFBs can act as both batteries and a fuel generation device depending on the needs of the user, which is advantageous because they can be recharged without replacing the electro-active material. The vanadium RFB is a promising technology, but is critically limited by only being able to store one electron per species giving a low energy density (~20 W h kg-1) and poor stability restricting many applications. 

Using the artificial intelligence driven discovery system of the ERC Advanced Grant SMART-POM, we aimed at the discovery of new metal oxide molecular polyoxometalate (POM) clusters showing unexpected properties. For instance, we found a molecule that can store > 10 times more electrons reversibly than the vanadium RFB making these the molecules the most reduced molecules ever discovered. Here we want to make a major step in translating this ground-breaking outcome of SMART-POM from discovery of new clusters, to scale up so the molecule can be tested in a flow battery device set up.  The heart of any flow battery is the electron storage redox electrolyte. The more electrons the electrolyte can store reversibly the higher the energy density and we aim here to beat the state of the art by at least an order of magnitude aiming >1000 Wh L-1 (at this point applications in electric cars are possible).

Moreover, current ship engines are excessively powerful diesel engines of 50-60% efficiency, resulting in excess of fuel combustion and cost (specially as fossil fuels prices increase over 50%), as well as causing noise and vibration impacting fishing effectiveness and crewâ€™s health. With benefits such as >30% reduction in fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions and air pollutants (SOx, NOx), considerable reduction in underwater noise, access to fish productâ€™s ecolabels and new tailored displacement hull form, RENship demonstrates its great business opportunity and potential to shift current shipping practices towards efficiency, lower costs and greener operation. 
Currently located at TRL6, we will integrate all components into a new design to build a pilot ship and validate RENShip in operational conditions, reaching TRL9. RENShip will be the first vessel totally operated by renewable energy and the smallest fishing vessel running with a hybrid propulsion system. There is currently one RENShip design we plan to take to the market with an average market price of â‚¬2M (10% profit margin), which will report â‚¬100K per boat to NAVIS.",2018-03-01,2018-06-30,50000.0,"['Wind', 'Fuel']",['renewable energy'],3,5

We have developed GEODEPower geothermal plants based on deep-drilling and enhanced geothermal well-system patented technology capable of delivering energy even in very low geothermal gradients, thus allowing exploitation at any location no matter geological activity. GEODEPower wells reach as deep as to 5,000 m, and through a closed loop system achieve high-energy delivery all year round occupying almost no space. Our technology can fit energy deliveries from 0.3 to 150 GWh/year/well with high utilization ratio in terms of operational hours. Thus, we can serve since low-temperature demanding end users such as residential and office buildings, sports arenas, parking lots, and sidewalks to airport runways, and large industrial users through heat pumps and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. 
GEODEPower closed-loop operation implies no fracking, no contamination of groundwater/soil, and zero emissions. These features together with the lack of operation noise, and the small area for installation, make them the ideal electricity, heating and cooling supplier in densely populated areas.
The first GEODEPower plant to demonstrate the technology in a relevant environment constructed in Asker 2016 (down to 800m) is now in testing phase (TRL6). A plant with 2x1500m wells is planned for Oslo Airport, drilling phase beginning in Nov 2017. After project completion at the airport will be at TRL7.
We have projected the roll out of our business plan initially through the Nordic countries, our domestic market, through an IPP developer model enabling to the end user to be plantâ€™s owner. Outside the Nordic market, we are focused on the deployment of 5,000m wells by licensees and joint venturing.

428,663466,Wavepiston,Low price wave energy conversion through force cancellation.,"No attempt to harvest energy from waves has resulted in an economically viable and competitive technology. Many projects stopped and investors have become sceptical of wave power. Currently the cost per watt of usable wave energy is high, due to a focus on energy conversion methods and efficiency, rather than on mooring and grid connection, accounting for more than 90% expenditure.
Wavepiston is a break through near-shore wave power technology producing energy from waves at a competitive price with respect to the most efficient renewable energy technologies. The system consists of identical modules mounted on a string pumping pressurized water to shore for successive energy conversion. Using Wavepistonâ€™s patented â€œforce cancellationâ€ principle the system is able to reduce the amount of forces on the mooring and structure to 1:10, requiring a simpler structure and therefore reducing capital costs. The Wavepiston system can provide cost efficient, clean and reliable renewable energy to help meet Europeâ€™s increasing demand and achieve emissions reduction targets. The offshore application ensures it is a suitable fit also for remote islands and isolated coastal communities.
The Wavepiston system was conceived in 2006 and in 2009 the concept of force cancellation was patented. In 2010 numerous tank tests were performed with a system 1:30 the size, that experimentally validated the system and proved each panel can harvest more than 5% of the energy contained in a wave. In 2013 a proof of concept was carried out offshore with a system 1:9 the size and it worked better than predicted. Vryhof Anchors and Nurmi Cylinders, specialised in offshore mooring and hydraulic pumps respectively, have joined the project to support product industrialization.

431,785585,SUNSET,Storage energy UNit for Smart and Efficient operation on Tarmac,"The steady growth of global air traffic passenger demand requires the air transport industry to work even harder to improve the associated levels of safety, efficiency, and environmental performances of aircrafts. As such, the transient to more electrified aircraft systems is strongly encouraged throughout the complete aircraft operational behaviour, including on-ground operations. Indeed, on-ground operations are still mostly engine based, the main engines designed for flight phases at high power levels are thus used as well as power source to move the aircraft on ground. This induces major economic and environmental losses: currently, fuel consumption from taxi operations is estimated to cost 6,4billionâ‚¬ and to reach 18M metric tons of CO2 emission per year. To reduce unnecessary fuel burn and their related emissions, a technological alternative has already been identified: Electric Taxiing System (e-Taxiing) . However, some technical bottlenecks, as the one dealing with the solution storage energy capacity, have still to be overcome before enabling those system to be used by all existing and future commercial aircrafts. SUNSET will target this specific technical challenge proposing a high performances energy storage module development connected to the future e-Taxiing system. The SUNSET technology will also address the related challenge of mass reduction by providing a high-density energy recovery capability (30Wh/kg) to perform aircraft electrical decelerations while also minimizing cooling and weight. SUNSET partners, Centum Adeneo and AmpÃ¨re Laboratory (UCBL) are part of the European recognised air industry value chain and will as such be involved in both development of the SUNSET solution with their Topic Manager support for its integration in the e-Taxiing system.

432,771294,AMPERE,"Accounting for Metallicity, Polarization of the Electrolyte, and Redox reactions in computational Electrochemistry","Applied electrochemistry plays a key role in many technologies, such as batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors or solar cells. It is therefore at the core of many research programs all over the world. Yet, fundamental electrochemical investigations remain scarce. In particular, electrochemistry is among the fields for which the gap between theory and experiment is the largest. From the computational point of view, there is no molecular dynamics (MD) software devoted to the simulation of electrochemical systems while other fields such as biochemistry (GROMACS) or material science (LAMMPS) have dedicated tools. This is due to the difficulty of accounting for complex effects arising from (i) the degree of metallicity of the electrode (i.e. from semimetals to perfect conductors), (ii) the mutual polarization occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface and (iii) the redox reactivity through explicit electron transfers. Current understanding therefore relies on standard theories that derive from an inaccurate molecular-scale picture. My objective is to fill this gap by introducing a whole set of new methods for simulating electrochemical systems. They will be provided to the computational electrochemistry community as a cutting-edge MD software adapted to supercomputers. First applications will aim at the discovery of new electrolytes for energy storage. Here I will focus on (1) â€˜â€˜water-in-saltsâ€™â€™ to understand why these revolutionary liquids enable much higher voltage than conventional solutions (2) redox reactions inside a nanoporous electrode to support the development of future capacitive energy storage devices. These selected applications are timely and rely on collaborations with leading experimental partners. The results are expected to shed an unprecedented light on the importance of polarization effects on the structure and the reactivity of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, establishing MD as a prominent tool for solving complex electrochemistry problems.",2018-04-01,2023-03-31,1588768.75,"['Storage', 'Fuel']",['energy storage'],3,5
433,775020,W2W - Wind and Solar,Innovative system for medium scale water desalination 100% powered by renewable energies,"We are RAINMAKER, a Dutch SME specialized in providing sustainable and disruptive solutions to combat water scarcity. We have developed W2W â€“water to water- the first water desalination system fully off-grid and fully powered by renewable energies (wind & solar).
Within Europe, especially western and Southern regions suffer water shortages, which will become increasingly more frequent and severe due to water demands and climate change. 
Seawater represents an inexhaustible resource to produce drinking water. However, conventional desalination techniques are extremely energy-intensive that are designed for large-scale capacity plants. Its cost is prohibitive for zones than require a smaller production of water. W2W is an innovative option for obtaining safe drinking water from seawater, brackish water or even polluted groundwater.  
The system consists of a wind turbine connected to a heat pump that is powered by solar energy when wind flow decreases, thus 100% powered by renewable energies. The thermal energy created by the power unit is used in a state-of-the-art membrane distillation system to evaporate and then condense feedwater from a water source to create fresh, pure water. 
A single unit of W2W can desalinate more than 95,000 litres of water a day, which can provide drinking water for more than 800 people without any grid connection.  Water is produced locally directly where it is needed without the need for long distribution nets and associated energy costs.  
Our system is targeted to coastal municipalities in the Mediterranean that need to increase their water purification capacity. Disaster relieve and emergency response operations can also benefit from W2W: it provides drinking water without the need of any energy/fuel supply, exactly the things that are normally lacking in such areas. 
Thanks to the development of this innovation we expect to gain a strong position in a highly attractive market currently worth 8.8 billion â‚¬ and growing at a CARG of 9%.",2017-06-01,2017-09-30,50000.0,"['Wind', 'Fuel']",['heat pump'],3,5

I will control their electrochemical response by external stimuli including electric field, strain, and illumination. In order to succeed, I will first develop a solid understanding of the unexplored key electrochemical properties of 2D materials and their dependence on these stimuli. I will fully exploit my recent experience in 2D materialsâ€™ research and the access to the world-class nanofabrication and characterisation facilities and scientific expertise at Cornell University, the University of Manchester, and National Physical Laboratory.

This research is motivated by the ever-increasing need for reliable sources of renewable energy, which will provide clean and inexpensive electric energy and address the irreversible depletion of fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of renewables (day-night, tidal, and weather cycles) does not permit on-demand supply of electricity.

The Silent Sensors system manages tyres through every stage from manufacture to maintenance and monitoring for repair, reuse and recycling.  By doing so it delivers three things:

â€¢Greater fuel efficiency â€“ when 25% of a haulage companyâ€™s costs are fuel, small fuel savings become big. With the Silent Sensors tyre management system we estimate between 2% and 6% fuel savings.
â€¢Increased tyre life â€“ by managing your tyres properly, you will achieve a significantly longer life for tyres. Spread over thousands of tyres used annually in a fleet, this leads to more money retained by the business.
â€¢Much safer tyres â€“ 20% of road accidents are caused by tyre failures. When tyres are properly maintained by Silent Sensors systems, there are fewer failures, and much safer transport.

Silent Sensors provides an efficient, easy tyre management system at a low cost using patented RFID technology. It measures tyre pressure, tread and temperature by simply applied sensors, allowing fleet owners to better manage one of their most vital resources. It is a precise, practical and world-leading system.

The core device is a thin-film III-V solar cell embedding quantum dots and photonic nanogratings to boost the efficiency beyond the thermodynamic limit of conventional single-junction devices. Combining the thin-film approach with the nanostructuring of semiconductor layers allows for a drastic improvement of power-to-weight ratio and mechanical flexibility with respect to currently available space solar cells.  The incorporation of quantum dots provides improved radiation and temperature hardness. The TFQD device targets efficiency higher than 30% (AM0), at least an eightfold increase of power-to-weight ratio vs. triple junction III-V solar cells and very low bending radius, allowing for the development of rollable or inflatable solar arrays.
Demonstration up to TRL4 will be carried out through on ground testing under representative in orbit conditions over a set of 44 prototypes.
The consortium includes four academic partners having a strong position in modelling, epi-layer structuring and development and manufacturing of thin-film III-V solar cells, a SME able to quickly implement the new technology in their thin-film solar cell production line, and a company that is a European leader in satellite systems as early adopter of the developed devices to boost innovation in space solar panels.  
On account of wafer reuse and simplicity of the epitaxial structures, the TFQD solar cells are less expensive than the current state-of-the-art multi-junction solar cells, thus also important impact potential on terrestrial applications, as first in concentrating photovoltaic systems, is foreseen.",2016-01-01,2018-12-31,1008376.25,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,5
444,692644,URBAVENTO,"An innovative, small footprint, vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production designed for urban areas, which is cheap to maintain and ensures energy production even at low wind speed","Customers using traditional horizontal axis wind turbines are facing several problems, such as: noise, unaesthetic appearance so they need to be installed in remote locations. As a result, the power is generated very far from where it is meant to be consumed, causing an energy loss of 20% during the transfer (line-losses); they also need strong winds to function and are expensive to install and maintain.
 Newenergy21 has designed and developed UrbaVento, an innovative vertical axis wind turbine for decentralized energy-production (smart grid applications as well as off-grid), which features carbon-fibre â€œwingsâ€, as well as a smart control and fault diagnostic software that simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting and tracks performance and savings. 
The UrbaVento is a big leap forward compared to current wind turbines due to its unique advantages, which are firstly: its compatibility with the urban environment, since it features silent energy production at low wind speeds, starting from less than 3m/s, while it can produce up to 10 MWh of electricity per year when operating between 7 and 10m/s; it is suited for distributed power production because it can be installed anywhere due to its compact size and attractive appearance. Secondly, it offers a higher return on investment since it is cheaper to install, operate and maintain, due to its low number of moving parts, the absence of a gearbox and the location of all serviceable components are at ground level, enabling the turbine to seamlessly reach its envisaged life-cycle; Thirdly, its wings can be used as a reflective screen, making it an attractive medium for advertising.
The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with 10 turbines installed in different locations, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.",2015-09-01,2015-12-31,50000.0,['Wind'],['smart grid'],2,5

The proprietary technology is a highly efficient method to produce renewable fuel oil with similarities to petroleum fuel oils. Timely commercialization will be achieved by bringing Hydrofaction to market via testing, scale-up and demonstration.
Based on a proven new chemical process, using renewable low-cost (non-food) feedstocks, Hydrofaction Oil can be burned in CHP applications, used a substitute for low-sulphur marine diesel or may be upgraded to diesel or jet via traditional petroleum refineries. 
The Project will advance the design of the Hydrofaction technology platform and mature the Companyâ€™s preparedness to attract new investment while moving the TRL level from 6 to 8: a critical step toward the commercialization of Hydrofaction. The Project objectives include adjusting the product offering to meet the needs of technology users (licensees) and their customers (oil buyers) by lowering the risks associated with the performance of future commercial plants as well as improving or modifying the quality of Hydrofaction Oil. 
Within the design of the Project, Hydrofaction Oil will be produced from feedstocks provided by potential commercial partners as well as comprehensive testing of that oil at certified laboratories. Future licensees expect that the scaled demonstration plant, approximately 100 times larger than SEAâ€™s current Pilot facility or 5.000 fuel tonne export capacity, will be representative in both physical design and operations to subsequent full-scale commercial plants to be based on 50.000 fuel tonne export modules transforming large amounts of biomass residuals to Hydrofaction Oil for oil refineries to upgrade to renewable diesel.

Hydrogen or (lean) biogas mixtures, landfill gas or (pyrolysis) process gases today often need to be flared and are simply wasted. promeos is for the first time ever enabling the well controlled, more efficient and cleaner combustion of these fossil or renewable gaseous fuels, thus helping protect the climate.
The new in-situ premix gas burners are targeted at global industrial markets worth billions of Euro, wherever high temperature heat is required and process gas â€“ of any calorific value and composition - is available locally as a fuel. The in-situ premix gas burners can also be used in automotive or fuel cell applications.
State of the art burners use either the diffusion or premix approach to mix fuel and air. Special or lean gases are typically handled more safely in diffusion type burners, at the cost of losing the better efficiency, higher safety and more compact design of the premix approach. The unique promeos porous burner in use since 2007 uses the conventional premix approach but as a volumetric burner. The NEW promeos in-situ premix burner is built on a new concept of micro premixing via a 3D-channel structure just before the flame front â€“ an approach called MFT â€œmixing flame trapâ€. It is only with this approach that the system can burn special and lean gases in a more efficient and safer way. It is also capable of generating higher temperatures than catalytic burners, where the catalyst reduces the temperature at which the fuel starts to burn. The MFT component can only be manufactured at target costs by making use of a 3D-printing approach.",2015-06-01,2015-11-30,50000.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,5
447,683876,SoHo3X,Introducing a novel concept of solar photovoltaic module in the market,"For more than 40 years, solar photovoltaic modules have not changed. The idea of interconnected cells sandwiched between glass and back sheet is still the same, and basically only the cell efficiency has increased. Given that cost reduction is a market driver in the photovoltaic business, it is necessary to pursue all fields leading to cost reduction and efficiency increase, including also module design. As a substitute for crystalline silicon flat modules, a new design of a trackless 3D concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) module has been designed and prototypes built. Its key characteristic is the use of holograms as optic concentrating devices in combination with other optical elements to obtain high optical efficiency achieving a concentration factor of 3X without tracking. Prototypes have been measured under industry relevant conditions. Results show the enormous potential of the design: up to 91% more annual performance ratio than conventional flat silicon fixed modules. Mass manufacturing costs of such modules have been estimated below EUR 0.40 per watt peak, i.e., even below silicon flat module. Given all these premises and the potential this product has in the growth and internationalization of the company, a business plan to launch this novel PV module product to the market is proposed in the present project. The business plan will cover all aspects for the company to enter the photovoltaic market with this product, among others: the analysis of technical risks and technical steps towards commercialization, including automated production lines, market survey of possible competitors, potential customers and markets segments, etc. The report must analyze all these issues and propose answers to how to approach them.",2015-07-01,2015-10-31,50000.0,,"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",2,5

After many decades of research and development, efficiencies are today flat with the best devices measuring 25 % in the laboratory. Significantly higher conversion efficiencies up to 38.8 % are so far only reached with multi-junction cells based on III-V semiconductors. However, these materials are too expensive for the use in flat-plat modules. Nanowires allow to significantly reduce material needs without compromising absorption or performance. The consortium has already shown InP single-junction nanowire solar cells on InP substrate, reaching world-record efficiencies of 13.8 % and using only 12 % of the volume of a conventional bulk solar cell. Combining III-V nanowires with todayâ€™s silicon photovoltaic technology offers the potential to reach at the same time very high performance devices, efficient use of materials and low cost. In this project we are aiming to demonstrate time an experimental proof of a tandem solar cell composed of a top pn-junction formed in III V nanowires and series connected to a bottom pn-junction formed in silicon.Such solar cell devices are either fabricated by direct growth of the nanowires on Si or by transferring a film of nanowires embedded in a polymer onto a Si bottom cell. Besides developing the best process to demonstrate such tandem solar cells with > 25 % efficiency, we are also addressing the important aspect of scaling up the technology to large areas. To reach this objective, we are developing technologies for large area III V nanowire arrays (> 10 cmÂ²) based on nano-imprint technology and epitaxial growth or on a new vapour phase growth method of nanowire aerotaxy. The wide-spread application of nano-materials and III-V compounds in photovoltaics further requires an in depth analysis of ecological and health related risks.

Composite recycling is a challenging task. Although mechanical grinding and pyrolysis reached a quite high TRL, landfilling of EoL composites is still widespread since no significant added value in the re-use and remanufacturing of composites is demonstrated.
The FiberEUse project aims at integrating in a holistic approach different innovation actions aimed at enhancing the profitability of composite recycling and reuse in value-added products.
The project is based on the realization of three macro use-cases, further detailed in eight demonstrators:
Use-case 1: Mechanical recycling of short GFRP and re-use in added-value customized applications, including furniture, sport and creative products. Emerging manufacturing technologies like UV-assisted 3D-printing and metallization by Physical Vapor Deposition will be used.
Use-case 2: Thermal recycling of long fibers (glass and carbon) and re-use in high-tech, high-resistance applications. The input product will be EoL wind turbine and aerospace components. The re-use of composites in automotive (aesthetical and structural components) and building will be demonstrated by applying controlled pyrolysis and custom remanufacturing. 
Use-case 3: Inspection, repair and remanufacturing for EoL CFRP products in high-tech applications. Adaptive design and manufacturing criteria will be implemented to allow for a complete circular economy demonstration in the automotive sector.
Through new cloud-based ICT solutions for value-chain integration, scouting of new markets, analysis of legislation barriers, life cycle assessment for different reverse logistic options, FiberEUse will support industry in the transition to a circular economy model for composites.",2017-06-01,2021-05-31,9793548.75,['Wind'],['recycling'],2,5

According to EI-ERO, offshore renewable energies have the potential to supply 25% of the electricity consumed annually in Portugal  and create a new export chain in these new technologies. The government envisages that potential exports in this field could increase up to ten times the current employment in the active sectors, with the greatest potential for exports seen in the development of the floating wind technology.
The overall objective of TWIND is to create a network of excellence that will dynamize a pool of specialized research professionals and trainers  in the domain of offshore wind energy to support an emerging industry in Portugal in a field with a very strong anticipated growth and no dedicated existing training curriculum. 
WavEC will be the pivot research institution of the low performing Member State (Portugal) coordinating efforts with internationally-leading counterparts at the EU level (Spain, UK and The Netherlands) and enhancing its excellence and innovation capacity through the exchange of knowledge with these leading research organizations. The combining capabilities of partners will open the grounds to exploit existing research results and invest in developing more knowledge. 
These objectives will be fulfilled through a set of strategic activities well-structured throughout the project including specific training programmes on thematic topics, short-term scientific meetings, long-term staff visits, networking meetings, attendance to relevant conferences in the field, knowledge transfer workshops with stakeholders and an annual event.

The consortium partners have chosen to focus on large wind turbines (in the region of 10MW), which are seen as the most effective way of reducing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The objective of the proposed project is two-fold: 1. Optimize and qualify, to a TRL5 level, two (2) substructure concepts for 10MW turbines.  The chosen concepts will be taken from an existing list of four (4) TRL>4 candidates currently supporting turbines in the region of 5MW. The selection of the two concepts will be made based on technical, economical, and industrial criteria. An existing reference 10MW wind turbine design will be used throughout the project. 2.

This methodology will be supported by existing numerical tools, and targeted development and experimental work. It is expected that resulting guidelines/recommended practices will facilitate innovation and competition in the industry, reduce risks, and indirectly this time, contribute to a lower LCOE. End users for the project deliverables will be developers, designers and manufacturers, but also decision makers who need to evaluate a concept based on given constraints. The proposed project is expected to have a broad impact since it is not led by single group of existing business partners, focusing on one concept only.

453,681719,IL-E-CAT,Enhancing electrocatalysis in low temperature fuel cells by ionic liquid modification,"The commercialization of low temperature fuel cells is restricted by the high cost and low durability of cathode catalysts. Intense efforts have been devoted to tackle this issue by engineering the structure of Pt-based catalysts. Herein, a novel concept towards enhancing the performance of low temperature fuel cell catalysts is proposed, namely by tuning the local active site microenvironment with an immobilized ionic liquid (IL) phase. As demonstrated by the applicant in preliminary work, a suitable IL layer strongly influences the active catalytic site in a very promising manner, apparently via a highly complex interplay of solvent-, ligand- and electrostatic-stabilization effects. As the structural versatility of ILs allows for rational engineering of this modification at molecular level, the proposed project aims for a full scientific exploration of the remarkable activation and stabilization effects in ORR, to enable the realization of an innovative fuel cell cathode with dramatically enhanced performance. To achieve this ambitious goal, a sound fundamental understanding of the interaction of ILs with electrocatalytic sites will be derived by making use of the excellent research infrastructure and longstanding experience in ionic liquid design and catalytic materials at our institute. To demonstrate the general applicability, the deduced principals will also be applied to CO2 electrochemical reduction. The approach will not stop at the design of novel catalyst systems, but will address solutions to ensure long-term stability of the IL modification. To avoid IL leaching from the catalyst over time, the recent success of the applicant in the synthesis of novel core/shell carbon materials will be employed. The IL will be synthesized in situ within a mesoporous core and the steric demanding ions fixed through a molecular sieving shell surrounding each catalyst particle.

HVDC technology is envisaged but the deployment of meshed HVDC offshore grids is currently hindered by the high cost of converter technology, lack of experience with protection systems and fault clearance components and immature international regulations and financial instruments. PROMOTioN will overcome these barriers by development and demonstration of three key technologies, a regulatory and financial framework and an offshore grid deployment plan for 2020 and beyond. A first key technology is presented by Diode Rectifier offshore converter. This concept is ground breaking as it challenges the need for complex, bulky and expensive converters, reducing significantly investment and maintenance cost and increasing availability.  A fully rated compact diode rectifier converter will be connected to an existing wind farm. The second key technology is an HVDC grid protection system which will be developed and demonstrated utilising multi-vendor methods within the full scale Multi-Terminal Test Environment. The multi-vendor approach will allow DC grid protection to become a â€œplug-and-playâ€ solution. The third technology pathway will first time demonstrate performance of existing HVDC circuit breaker prototypes to provide confidence and demonstrate technology readiness of this crucial network component. The additional pathway will develop the international regulatory and financial framework, essential for funding, deployment and operation of meshed offshore HVDC grids.

GRAVI3 is an innovative hybrid steel-concrete offshore sub-structure for transitional water depths between 35 and 60m. It will sustainably reduce the levelized cost of energy by up to 15% by combining the following vectors:
- Using three concrete caissons, with water ballast, instead of more complex and costly steel solutions and anchoring systems
- Using a smaller steel structure
- Performing all construction and assembly onshore and towing the complete unit to the site where it is submerged with an innovative and robust method.
- Preventing the use of heavy lift vessels and reducing the level of complexity and risk of offshore operations.
GRAVI3 has undergone the typical technology development process and is presently at TRL5. The logical next steps is the demonstration at full scale in real operational conditions. Thus, the project fits perfectly to the addressed Call for Proposals as the project will support technology development and bring the technology close to market readiness.
The proposed project will design, engineer, build, assemble, transport, install and demonstrate a full scale foundation, equipped with a 2 MW offshore wind turbine, in a consented and grid connected demonstration site. Additionally, the project will undertake further technology development for improved design and perform an in depth evaluation of the technologyâ€™s future industrialization, competitiveness and bankability.

456,656870,ARTIST,Advancing Rechargeable-Batteries Through In Situ Techniques,"Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have enabled the portable device revolution of the last two decades, and have undoubtedly had a dramatic societal impact, with rechargeable electronic devices now ubiquitous. The light Li-containing electrodes, and high working cell voltages (typically >3.5 V) make LIBs the most practical solution for many portable applications. However, when significantly larger storage capacity is demanded, such as in transportation or grid-based energy storage, the limited availability, and consequently elevated cost, of Li becomes prohibitive. This research project will investigate alternative battery technologies that use more earth-abundant ions for charge transport, namely Mg, to enable the next generation of energy storage devices. The atomic-scale mechanisms of Mg-ion insertion/extraction at electrode-electrolyte interfaces and how these interfaces evolve during charging/discharging will be investigated. Complementary in situ techniques will be used to investigate the evolution of electrode structure and chemical state using carefully designed model electrodes. The study of scaled-up electrodes integrated into complete batteries will extend this understanding to more realistic battery cycling conditions. This will provide important insights to help overcome the limitations of the materials currently used in Mg-ion batteries (MIBs).

To achieve this, a solar cell with an efficiency in excess of 50% is required and will require considerable development over the present state of the art.  In particular, a new semiconductor absorber layer with a 1eV band-gap will be required in addition to solar concentrations in excess of 1000X.  The proposed research addresses both of these areas.

Preliminary work has identified the use of bismide semiconductors to achieve the required 1eV semiconductor junction.    A 1eV GaAsBi0.062 layer can be grown that has only 0.6% mismatch to GaAs, as compared to conventional  In0.3GaAs that introduces >2% mismatch.  We will develop high-performance photovoltaic devices based on this material.   We will characterise the optical and electronic structure of these new materials using spectroscopic ellipsometry and photo/electroreflectance.  The nature and concentration of defects will be determined using time-resolved optical spectroscopy and correlated with solar cell performance data by extending existing computer models.

To achieve high efficiencies at high concentrations, it is necessary to reduce the resistive loss. Here, we propose to exploit lateral emission in tensile quantum well (QW) layers to provide a parallel radiative transport pathway that delivers photogenerated charges to the electrical contacts. A series of InGaP/InGaAsP QW test structures in compressive, tensile and unstrained configurations will be grown to control the directionality of emission, which will be confirmed using spectroscopic measurements.  Concentrator solar cell device structures will be processed and the effective sheet resistivity evaluated using electroluminescent imaging.

459,640873,CPVMatch,Concentrating Photovoltaic modules using advanced technologies and cells for highest efficiencies,"It has been proven that the only realistic path to close the gap between theoretical and practical ultra-high efficiency solar cells is the monolithic multi-junction (MJ) approach, i.e. to stack different materials on top of each other. Each material/sub solar cell converts a specific part of the sunÂ´s spectrum and thus manages the photons properly. However, large area multi-junction cells are too expensive if applied in standard PV modules. A viable solution to solve the cost issue is to use tiny solar cells in combination with optical concentrating technology, in particular, high concentrating photovoltaics (HCPV), in which the light is concentrated over the solar cells more than 500 times. The combination of ultra-high efficient cells and optical concentration lead to low cost on system level and eventually to low levelised electricity costs, today well below 8 â‚¬cent/kWh and at the end of this project below 5 â‚¬cent/kWh. Therefore, to achieve an optimised PV system (high efficiency, low cost and low environmental impact), world-wide well-known partners in the field of CPV technology propose this project to run and progress together the development of highly-efficient MJ solar cells and the improvement of the concentrator (CPV module) technique.

The central objective of the project is to realise HCPV solar cells and modules working at a concentration level â‰¥800x with world record efficiency of 48 % and 40 %, respectively, hence bringing practical performances closer to theoretical limits. This should be achieved through novel MJ solar cell architectures using advanced materials and processes for better spectral matching as well as through innovative HCPV module concepts with improved optical and interconnection designs, thus including novel light management approaches. The ambition for this project is not less than to achieve the highest efficiencies on solar cell and module level world-wide, thus Europe will be the top player for the CPV-technology.",2015-05-01,2018-10-31,4949596.25,,"['solar cell', 'PV']",2,5

The bioreceptor system interacts with the target analyte and this interaction is monitored by the transducer, which converts the information into a measurable effect such as an electrical, optical or mass-sensitive signal.
This project proposes the development of an autonomous electrochemical biosensor that is lightweight, disposable and low cost by using an outstanding innovative approach: hosting synergistically the bioreceptor element inside a passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). Such approach will provide an electrically independent, very simple, miniaturized, autonomous electrical biosensor. The electrical dependency is eliminated by coupling the biosensor to an electrochemical transducer that is capable of autonomous energy production, the fuel cell. This work proposes a merge between electrical biosensors and fuel cells, combining the advantages of both areas of research in a single synergetic device. 
In this envisaged innovative device, the electrical signal obtained from the DMFC is directly related to the concentration of the cancer biomarker in the sample analyzed.

461,711792,LiRichFCC,A new class of powerful materials for electrochemical energy storage: Lithium-rich oxyfluorides with cubic dense packing,"The LiRichFCC project will explore an entirely new class of materials for electrochemical energy storage termed â€œLi-rich FCCâ€ comprising a very high concentration of lithium in a cubic dense packed structure (FCC). The process by which energy is stored in these materials constitutes a paradigm change in the design of battery materials and involves unexpected and surprisingly effective mechanisms: instead of storing lithium ions by intercalation into a stable host, lithium ions are populating and vacating lattice sites of the material itself. This new principle allows for unprecedented energy and power density compared to other battery materials and may revolutionize the use of batteries in applications involving a need for supplying large amounts of energy and power from small spaces.
Li-rich FCC materials have just been discovered by one of the partners of the consortium, and the possible chemical compositions, properties, and charge storage principle associated with this new materials class are far from being understood. Thus, it is the aim of the project to explore and optimize possible compositions, synthesis methods, structural properties and dynamics of Li-rich FCC materials through an interdisciplinary approach involving predictive computational work, advanced chemical synthesis and high-end characterization. An important focus of the project will further be to evaluate the use of these materials for electrical energy storage and to identify potential other uses for Li-rich FCC materials that cannot be foreseen today. 
Due to the inherent paradigm change and the high promise Li-rich FCC materials hold both in regards to fundamental science as well as to battery applications, LiRichFCC fulfils all the preconditions of the call. The project is based on the long-term vision to develop a novel class of materials into practical use, involving foundational aspects in S&T with breakthrough character, high novelty and risk, and a broad, interdisciplinary approach.",2016-10-01,2019-09-30,4114753.5,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,5

To this goal, we will develop and exploit advanced preparative methods based on two fundamental ingredients: (a) ordered 'anodic' porous oxides and (b) atomic layer deposition (ALD). The former solids will be generated as templates providing ordered arrays of straight, cyclindrical pores, the diameter and length of which can be varied between 20 nm and 300 nm and between 0.5 microns and 50 microns, respectively. The latter method will be used to coat the inner pore walls with one or several layers of the photovoltaic stack, each with a thickness set to values chosen between 1 nm and 30 nm.
We will invent and characterize novel surface reaction schemes for the deposition in ALD mode (from the gas phase and from solutions) of functional materials (doped semiconductors and intrinsic light absorbers) with tailored chemical and physical properties. We will investigate the experimental conditions in which they can be combined in a way that optimizes the quality of their interfaces.
Finally, we will quantify the electrical and photovoltaic performance of p-i-n junctions prepared with our methods. We will have the unique capability of describing in a systematic, accurate manner how the experimental photovoltaic parameters depend on the individual thicknesses of the individual layers and on the length of the cylinders. This direct experimental handle on the amount of light absorbed, on the one hand, and the charge carrier transport distances to the electrical contacts, on the other hand, will be correlated with the relevant material parameters (absorption coefficients, carrier mobilities). This information will unveil the phenomena limiting the efficiency of each type of solar cell, and suggest avenues to remedy them.",2015-09-01,2020-08-31,1938655.0,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,5

The shifting from fossil fuel to renewable energy has been slow mostly due to technological barriers. Meanwhile, the demand for energy is growing rapidly which makes fossil fuel consumptions inevitable, in spite of their high emission of GHC. Therefore, there is need for an immediate-medium term solutions to address CO2 emission of fossil fuel plants fast and in a cost effective way. CO2 capture technologies recognized one of the direct answers to this problem. 
Currently, CO2 capture technologies have been adopted in different parts of the world but still there is a long way to reach their full potential. Some of the most important barriers are large energy requirements and high cost. Advanced material solutions can play a significant role in price reduction and increase of efficiency and enable industries to use fossil fuel while reduce emission of GHC drastically.
GENESIS project aims to develop and upscale some of the most promising material for CO2 capture and demonstrate their performance, durability and reliability in industrial environments. GENESIS is build upon two previous ambitious EU projects that developed IPOSS and MOF membrane systems with a great performance for CC. GENESIS will take these technologies a step further by scaling up the most promising ones by demonstrating in relevant 0.45 MWe capture process for pre-combustion and 2 post-combustion applications and achieve at least 90% of CO2 recovery at a cost of 15â‚¬/MWh in two carbon intensive industries (Cemex & Arcelormittal).  
GENESIS is building upon a multidisciplinary team of European technology centers, large enterprises, SMEs in a cross-border project. This will guarantee that the successful implementation of GENESIS and ensure the ambitious objectives will be achieved and impact will be realized in terms of a rapid market penetration of the developed materials and systems by overcoming technological barriers.",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,7970773.51,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,5

IATA set a strict requirement to use only biojet fuel meeting SRB sustainability standards, while Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), the only viable way to produce biojet is still largely relying on food crops (mainly palm oil, not sustainable for deforestation). HVO producers are all eager to find sustainable and viable feedstock alternative in Europe. We estimate a Total Addressable Market of 2 Mt/y in 2020 to be covered with sustainable feedstock in Europe.
Solaris is a patented variety of tobacco plant specifically targeted as feedstock for second generation biofuel: nicotine free, non GMO, producing oil-containing seeds, no food competing, globally available and cultivable in Europe. Solaris allows the highest oil productivity of all oil producing crops, only second to palm: double than rapeseed and jatropha. It is cultivable in Europe, which has strong tobacco cultivation experience, while other second generation crops are not. It is fully sustainable: certified since 2012 by 2BSvs and since 2015 by the RSB. Solaris biojet can reach 83% CO2 reduction compared to fossil jet fuel.

Rare earth magnets based upon neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB, also containing dysprosium) are used in a wide range of products, including for example clean energy technologies (wind turbines and electric vehicles) and high tech sectors such as electronics. However in recent years the supply of these materials has come under considerable pressure and neodymium and dysprosium are now deemed to be of greatest supply risk for all elements. 
 
The EU imports far more NdFeB magnets than it manufactures (>1,000 tonnes manufactured per annum). It has been estimated that ~ 2,000-3,000 tonnes/annum of NdFeB will be available by 2020 for recycling, which presents a significant opportunity. The aim of this project is to identify, separate, recycle and demonstrate recycled magnets at a pilot scale with a multidisciplinary team located across the EU. The project will target three of the main application sectors including automotive, electronics and wind turbines.  
 
The project will develop new sensing and robotic sorting lines for the identified EoL products, building upon technologies developed in the FP7 project Remanence. New hydrogen based technologies will be demonstrated at scale for separating and purifying NdFeB powders from the robotically sorted parts and this technology will be duplicated at another partner in the project. The separated powders will be re-manufactured into sintered magnets, injection moulded magnets, metal injection moulded magnets and cast alloys, at 4 different companies across 3 countries, building upon work in the Repromag Horizon 2020 project.

Solar energy is considered as the ultimate solution in this regard. Among the three generations of solar cells developed with this objective, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells with demonstrated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22 % have bagged the greatest attention. Despite the impressive PCE, lower cost and facile processing opportunities for hybrid perovskite solar cells,  their commercialization is not yet realized; poor stability, lack of robustness to subtle variations in processing, and Pb toxicity being the bottlenecks. We take up the view that pursuing fundamental understanding of the photophysics and photovoltaic process of these highly  efficient  lead halide  perovskites can contribute to tackle their instability issue and also to the development of Pb free organic-inorganic halide perovskites with analogous optical and photovoltaic performance to that of former, expediting their market entry. Apart from photovoltaic sector, the fundamental knowledge evolved through this project is expected to have direct impact on the fabrication of high performing photodetectors, lasers, and light emitting devices based on hybrid perovskite materials.

Photovoltaics is a realistic R&D area in which to set up and operationalize an Open Science demonstrator. By adopting the model of RRI, definitively we will demonstrate how increased endorsement of PV technology will increase utilization and integration of PV technology into the electric energy supply system.
GRECO proposes RRI solutions to increase PV technology useful life, reduce its cost through increased performance and, demonstrate novel competitive solutions in agriculture and buildings. These targets will be met by providing 6 responsible and innovative solutions.
The project brings together several expertise from many areas of knowledge in a coalition among all stakeholders of the quadruple helix representing three continents in a research project with research lines at different Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).

468,844703,RHODOCAR,Global and local impacts on Atlantic RHODOlith beds: Implications for estimates of blue CARbon ecosystem services,"Rhodolith beds are one of the most extensive benthic ecosystems along the Atlantic coasts and key environments to continental shelf resilience. Besides providing substrate and habitat for numerous other algae and sessile invertebrates, their ability to calcify, their high abundance and biomass, makes rhodoliths major carbonate producers. Recent empirical estimations suggest that the carbonate marine deposits generated by these organisms represent a total potential carbon sink of 0.4 x 109 t C yr-1. Hence, giving the increasing role of marine ecosystems in the storage of blue carbon, rhodolith beds may represent a not yet considered significant carbon store. Regarding carbon sequestration, studies on rhodolith bed community metabolism are scarce and so far only available for two temperate beds that indicate that they can act both as CO2 source and organic carbon sink. As many marine ecosystems, rhodolith beds are currently under threat related to global climate change (GCC), with local impacts due to increasing coastal urbanization, potentially lowering even further their resilience. Thus, by using a physiological approach, this project will provide much needed information on the basic mechanistic understanding of rhodolith metabolism (photosynthesis, calcification), rhodolith responses to global and local stressors, and rhodolith bed community metabolism and carbon storage along a latitudinal gradient. Taken together, this information will allow assessing the importance of rhodolith beds as natural carbon sinks, thus, help ascertain whether these ecosystems meet the requirements to be integrated into climate mitigation policy, and will further allow quantifying the effects of GCC on their carbon sequestration and storage ability. In addition, it will help recognizing potential interactions between global and local stressors, hence, aid in the development of effective local conservation and management strategies.",2019-06-01,2021-05-31,147815.04,['Storage'],['carbon sequestration'],2,5

PowerBrise comes as a smart solution both to significantly improve the energy self-consumption of large non-residential buildings and to increase their energy efficiency. Synthesis s.r.l.  goes a step further in the current state of the art by developing an novel photovoltaic solution for building FaÃ§ades which integrates for the first time the benefits of  : (1) Brise soleil (or louver system), (2) Photovoltaic power and (3) Building Automation Systems (BAS).  PowerBrise uses sun radiation to generate power but at the same time lets in some sun light through the semi-transparent cells.
Brise soleil by its own increases the comfort inside the building and reduces up to 25% its energy consumption; the integration of photovoltaic cells inside the glass of brise soleil and the smart motorization to automatically follow the sun direction, makes PowerBrise is able to save up 40% of the building energy costs, supplying by means of renewable energy, up to 25% of the energy consumed by the building. We expect that the deployment of PowerBrise in the EU and international markets will allow Synthesis for the exploitation of a business opportunity in new and retrofit installations that will bring cumulative revenues of 30 Mâ‚¬ by 2025, with a ROI of 4.7 and the creation of 37 direct jobs by 2025.

470,807140,BIAR,THE BiAR PROCESS: TRANSFORMING LOW-VALUE BIOMASSESINTO HIGHLY VALUABLE FOR ENERGY-RECOVERY FUELS,"Bioenergy is by far the leading renewable energy source in Europe, accounting for 61.2% of all renewable energy sources consumed. The increasing demand is attributed to the fact that biomass is the only renewable energy source providing solutions for all energy sectors: transportation, power, and heating and cooling.  
Due to this high demand, European biomass industry has the neccesity of making a better energetic use of the feedstocks and wastes, which are continuously generated but are practically unused in energetic terms due to their ash-rich content, which is regulated by the ISO 17225.
BiAR is a chemical proccess to remove the ash content from ash-rich lignocellulosic (e.g. bark, rice husks) up to 95% biomass or sludge digestate, that consists of 3 differentiated steps: 1) liquefaction of the organics through solvolysis, 2) ash content separation through filtration, and 3) recovery of solvents through distillation. BiAR is a process for the valorisation of wastes, increasing their efficiency as a fuel up to 90% but also increasing their economic value since the produced pellets will be sold at higher price thanks to the improvement in the quality. Thus, biomass pellets producers will be willing to pay for a process that will help them to increase their benefits per ton (in the worst scenario, they will increase the selling price from 129 â‚¬/ton Enplus B pellets to 230 â‚¬/ton EnplusA1). Thus, BiAR will increase the benefits of biomass pellet producers up to more than 200%.
Moreover, BiAR process in aligned with the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC), which sets a 20% target of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020, with bioenergy playing a key role. BiAR will help to boost the Circular Economy in Europe since it is the only proccess able to valorise wastes and sludges, that nowadays cannot be used with energetic purposes.",2018-03-01,2018-06-30,50000.0,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,5

Electrical refrigeration and air-conditioning consume almost 25% of the electrical energy in Europe, a tremendous saving potential and attractive business opportunity for new technologies. Eco ice KÃ¤lte GmbH develops technologies to exploit this attractive market potential, to generate significant growth and with this contribute to achieving the climate targets. One very promising approach results from the globally rising use of LNG as energy source, since a huge cold capacity at -162Â°C is stored in LNG, which is hitherto completely wasted during the regasification by heat exchange with ambient air or sea water at port terminals and LNG end userâ€™s sites, respectively. Eco ice has developed and patented an innovative technology (TRL6) in various output classes to recover this highly valuable cold capacity without additional electrical power or gas consumption and provide it very cost-efficiently to the market.
The Eco ice technology has the potential, without any self-consumption of natural gas, to create electrical power savings of 5.000 MW, i.e. to replace the fossil fuels for several large power stations. The cold market is increasingly looking for such cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternatives, as confirmed by customer feedback. Even in a conservative business scenario, which assumes a technology conversion rate of only 5%, a profitable short term growth up to a high two digit million â‚¬ revenue value can be expected, as confirmed by ongoing negotiations with potential launching customers and business partners.

473,728883,ZeoBio-NG,Innovative biogas upgrading system based on novel Zeolite adsorbent technology for producing Bio-based Natural Gas,"Agricultural activities correspond to about 10% of the EUâ€™s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Animal manure decomposition, which produces the extremely harmful GHG emissions methane and nitrous oxide, generated 78.7million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The production of â€œbiogasâ€ offers the potential to eliminate exposure of decomposing organic matter such as manure to the air, thereby preventing methane and other gases from escaping into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters, used to produce biogas, have gained prominence in the market and are helping to address this problem by clean burning the biogas fuel to generate combined heat and power. However, the inherent energy of biogas is relatively low, and secondly, it has a low conversion efficiency. This makes it difficult for biogas producers to create sufficient return on investment, especially the small-to-medium scale operators.

Upgrading biogas to biomethane, by removing CO2, has the potential to provide the green biogas production sector with a sounder economical footing. Biomethane is a â€œhigher-valueâ€ fuel. High quality biomethane can be compressed and used as a transport fuel, or injected into the natural gas grid. As a transport fuel, it can be sold by producers for roughly 4 times the price of electricity, with numerous other benefits. However, most biogas producers are prevented from exploiting this opportunity due to the significant upfront investment costs and high energy requirements of current biomethane upgrading technologies. 

NeoZeo AB - an award winning, venture capital backed SME based at the Stockholm University innovation hub - has a novel solution to this problem; ZeoBio-NG is a patented biogas upgrading system that has higher efficiency, lower energy requirements, and costs 50% less than the state-of-the-art.

In 2013, a total of 550 million identities were breached; a 62% increase over 2012. In addition, the cost of breaches is rising, with a worldwide average of over $3 million per breach. Hacking is the primary causes of data breaches, and todayâ€™s existing solutions are simply not sufficient to meet the threat.

The objective of Dyadic Security is to provide high security to organizations, and to protect digital assets, even in the event of a network breach. Dyadicâ€™s Distributed Security Module (DSM) is a unique software-only offering that provides the highest level of security while being affordable and easy to deploy. At the core of the DSM lies cutting-edge technology based on decades of cryptographic research on secure multiparty computation (MPC). Dyadicâ€™s DSM solves the inherent single point of failure in all of todayâ€™s security systems. Strong cryptographic solutions exist for protecting data, securing web traffic, authenticating users, and so on. However, they all rely on the secret key and authentication credentials (e.g., passwords) remaining secret. In todayâ€™s reality where hackers get past firewalls and penetrate deep into networks, these keys and credentials are stolen thereby rendering all cryptographic protection useless. Dyadicâ€™s DSM randomly splits keys and credentials across servers so that they are never in any single place to be stolen. The advanced protocols used in the DSM ensure that even if some of the servers are breached and completely controlled by an attacker, the secrets and credentials cannot be stolen. The result is that digital assets remain safe, even when all else has failed and attackers are inside the network. 

Dyadic has a disruptive and innovative product range which, in contrast to existing solutions, provides protection in the event of a breach, and not just detection.",2015-04-01,2017-03-31,2017750.0,,['DSM'],1,5

By combining an existing technology for rubber recycling (i.e. devulcanization with ozone treatment) with a unique mechano-chemical method (using a patented chemical agent), waste tyres will be converted into higher value products than those obtained with current solutions on an industrial scale. 
The market for waste tyres is tightly connected with the production of new tyre as eventually all the produced tyres need to be reclaimed. The tyre industry uses by 70% of all the natural rubber and estimates for the next 30 years predict that the consumption will double. This could mean that the availability of raw materials such as natural and synthetic rubbers may become problematic. Despite being Europe the second largest virgin rubber consumer in the world (with a tyre production estimated at 20% of the world production), EU has not established its own alternative for rubber materials recycling and production, being dependent on supply from South East Asia.
RETYRE will increase the value of End-of-Life Tyres (ELTs) by improving the recycling efficiency and producing as output a high-value devulcanized rubber. This recycling option will increase EUÂ´s global competitiveness and innovativeness by improving European recyclersâ€™ market position and decreasing EUÂ´s dependency on raw rubber materials.

478,745058,MICROCYCLING,Development of an Energy Efficient PET Recycling Process Based on Microwave Heating,"Plastic bottles are one of the most used and preferred packaging container worldwide. Current levels of usage and disposal generate several environmental problems with 74% of post-consumer plastic waste in Europe either incinerated or landfilled. Recent packaging directives from the EC have led to the imposition of challenging targets for recycling, and national governments are also examining new ways to discourage packaging waste. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is very recyclable and offers an opportunity to effectively and efficiently recapture and reuse the energy and resources of its raw materials. However, the high energy demand of current recycling processes renders it expensive and non-viable, making recycled PET (rPET) more expensive than virgin PET, resulting in low uptake in the lucrative food and beverages packaging industry. The main technical problem with current recycling is the high amount of energy consumed in the processes which limits the industrial profitability. Furthermore, existing technologies require additional purification systems to eliminate contaminates, further increasing cost and limiting supply. 

Gamma Meccanica is developing an alternative recycling process, using microwaves, to solve the current viability problems. Our technology will be the first in the world to address the profitability of the microwave technology in PET recycling by: Reducing the energy consumption of the process by up to 50%; Decontaminating the pellets in a single step process, providing a cleaning efficiency of >97% to attain pellet purity levels required by the FDA and EFSA; Reduced GHG emissions â€“ saving about 2 tonnes of GHG for each tonne of rPET; Enabling rPET to be sold at a 15% cheaper price than virgin PET. 

We are now at an advanced stage of development and will produce the final design of the industrial reactor in Phase 2 of this project. During this Phase 1, we will conduct a market study to identify key customers and refine our strategy.",2016-11-01,2017-04-30,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,5

Energy demand is set to increase by 75% by 2035 and (if no change incurs) will largely depend on fossil fuels (IEA 2013). In response to these concerns, Rapidly Developing Countries are currently seeking to tap its vast renewable energy potential (IRENA 2013). This shift to renewable energy provides a unique opportunity to study socio-technical transition to low-carbon technologies. Transitioning to renewable energy requires policy reform, infrastructure investment, citizen mobilization, and smart financing mechanisms. The RE-DEV project will examine the conditions for the take-up of renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries and, by doing so, uncover its consequences in terms of global CO2 emissions. Drawing on a comparative study of four selected country-cases (China, India, South Africa, and Morocco), this project will offer an in-depth analysis of: (a) regulatory frameworks and existing financing mechanisms, (b) the limits and potential of multilateral climate cooperation, (c) the state of vertical/horizontal transfer of know-how. The country sample responds to a most-dissimilar-systems research design. To gather evidence, this project will employ the following methods: semi-structured interviews with policy makers, questionnaires and a participatory assessment with public/private stakeholders. As a result of this, the RE-DEV project will build knowledge on how to facilitate a sustained transition to renewable energy in Rapidly Developing Countries. I put a strong emphasis on three aspects: the interdisciplinary character of the project, its intersectoral nature, and the crucial issue of its timing â€“ it needs to be carried out now, when domestic energy transitions and the post-Kyoto climate change deal (due at Paris COP 21) are at a crucial point of their development.",2015-11-06,2017-11-05,158121.6,,['renewable energy'],1,5

The design will be based on the existing Wedge Global W200 PTO prototype and will focus on augmenting its specific force density and efficiency to levels which can significantly increase the energy capture in many types of Wave Energy Converters. These enhancements will also solve one of the key issues with WEC PTO systems, namely achieving sufficiently high peak force to limit hitting end-stops during large waves whilst maintaining high efficiency and low cost for the average wave case.

The performance and reliability demanded by wave energy systems exceeds the normal capabilities of commercial, off the shelf components commonly used in other industries.  In the few cases where they are suitable, the costs often prove prohibitive. In addition, the lack of predominant PTO technology is causing a barrier to establishing a dedicated supply chain. 

Currently each original equipment manufacturer system has different requirements, and pursuing the development of bespoke components not only limits the utility of the end product but also multiplies the development costs.

The objective of SEA TITAN proposal is to break this practice and to develop an optimized crosscutting power take-off based on the existing switched reluctance linear generator from Wedge Global with application to multiple systems through collaboration with multiple wave energy developers and an industrial partner with a strong track record on technology. In addition this proposal aims to offer the developed technology open source to promote update and accelerate innovation.",2018-04-01,2021-03-31,3890341.75,,['wave energy'],1,5

During aluminium extraction and recycling, salt slag is generated in vast volume and is a growing environmental problem. In Europe there are >270 known aluminium processing plants and only nine salt slag recycling facilities, this number is restricted due to economic viability of operation; there are very high initial capital cost and high operating costs. These costs create a high entry barrier for any new company to enter into the salt recycling business. EU countries such as Scandinavia and Eastern Europe transport many thousands of tonnes of salt slag p.a. thousands of kilometres for processing at the few locations available at enormous financial and environmental cost.

This is a threat to the aluminium production industry as costs to process salt slag are becoming extremely high.  Due to the monopolisation of re-processing options, it is a financial security issue for the aluminium recyclers as they are in the hands of the nine salt slag recyclers in operation. This highlights an industry need for aluminium recycling companies to manage in house all of their by-products and waste materials economically.

ALTEK is a technology-based company with specialist expertise and experience in aluminium technology.  With EC FP7 funding support, ALTEK have developed to TRL 6, ALUSALT, an in-house salt slag processing unit that offers aluminium recycling plants an economic solution to salt slag processing, reducing energy process requirements,  transport costs and CO2 emissions. ALUSALT offers the industry a solution that complies with EU legislation, reduces environmental impact and can achieve cost savings of â‚¬1.95m p.a. (based on a 10,000 tonnes p.a salt slag producer).

Based on existing experience the consortium can deliver a particularly suitable toolkit that is based upon a broad survey of actual use cases. Concretely, the ENERGISE toolkit addresses the following issue.
Smart grid solutions hold immense opportunities for both European businesses as well as society as a whole and contribute substantially to achieving the objectives of a low carbon economy. Telecommunication infrastructure constitutes a vital part of any smart grid solution. Given the penetration of telecommunication infrastructure in Europe, it is likely that significant synergies can be achieved in the process of implementing smart grid solutions if existing telecommunication infrastructure can be used.
Identifying specific cases or business models, where shared infrastructure use is beneficial, is difficult for all stakeholders. ENERGISE sets out to solve this issue by providing energy suppliers and telecommunication providers as well as policy makers with a decision-supporting toolkit.

484,730628,OCEAN_2G,Second Generation technologies in ocean Energy,"The interest for renewable energies has exponentially risen in the last few years. Several factors have contributed to this growth, highlighting the increase of the energy demand, the political instability of many countries that produce fossil fuels, the high fluctuation of oil prices, the countriesâ€™ energy dependence and the concern generated by the environmental impact produced by the traditional sources of energy. This fact has boosted the development of numerous renewable energies sources and has promoted the establishment of ambitious objectives by the main world organisations, such as the one set by the European Commission of covering 20% of the energy demand with renewable energies sources by 2020. By using current marine energy harnessing technology, it would be possible to provide up to 13% of the global energy, by extracting 2,200 TWh/year.

The OCEAN_2G (Validation and pre-certification of a new 2 MW tidal energy converter) innovation project aims to validate and develop and pre-certify for its later industrialization stage an innovative full-size tidal energy harnessing system solution, ready to enter into European and global markets boosting the growth performance of industrial partners of the consortium and placing itself as a worldwide referent in the manufacturing of floating tidal energy converters.

Magallanes Renovables SL has designed, built and tested the 1:10 scale model of the platform in open water conditions, and has finalised the construction of a full-scale prototype.

485,817285,pvDesign,A Cutting-Edge Software for the Feasibility Analysis and Design of Photovoltaic Power Plants,"Year 2016 was a record year for the solar industry. A total of 76.6 GW (mostly in the utility-scale segment) was installed and connected to the grid. That is a 50% yearly growth over the 51.2 GW installed in 2015 and the third highest rate recorded since 2010. In 2016, global solar power capacity exceeded 300 GW. It is expected the total global installed PV capacity to exceed 400 GW in 2018, 500 GW in 2019, 600 GW in 2020 and 700 GW in 2021. Developing a utility-scale PV power plant needs to perform a thorough feasibility analysis and a precise basic engineering study due to the high investment required (c.a. 1 â‚¬/w, i.e. 100 MMâ‚¬ for a 100 MW plant) and hence, the serious financial risk associated with a new solar farm. Many aspects must be taken into account to make an accurate assessment of the new PV plant: sun irradiation, meteorological variables, elevations, slopes, shades, efficiency of panels, layouts, inverters, type of grid connection, electrical substation features, cabling, etc. Until now, solar developers and engineering companies made this work manually spending a great deal of men/hours of engineers and draftsmen, with the help of in-house developed tools (normally based on excel sheets). The ever growing PV utility-scale solar industry is urgently demanding new tools to create much more automated, fast, accurate and reliable feasibility analysis and design studies. The goal is to optimise and fasten the process, reduce the investment risk associated with these large projects and make easier the work to engineers and developers. pvDesign is a software as a service (SaaS) cloud based tool that allows to automate the utility-scale PV power plant feasibility analysis and design process making it much faster (max 1h), accurate and reliable (errors reduction from 10% down to 3.5%). pvDesign free trial Beta version is being tested by more than 30 companies in more than 15 countries.

Current PV plantsâ€™ monitoring systems can detect a series of standard failures but have a limited resolving accuracy of around 10%. This results in a reduction of the global performance of the plants what in average accounts for 15% of loses of the potential IRR for the owners, which translates into â‚¬500,000 annually and up to â‚¬12.5 million over the whole lifetime of the plant. Currently, high-accuracy (1%) determination of the exact root cause requires a manual physical check in the field down to the panel level with the associated labour cost of typically â‚¬500 per day over many days. DeepSolar tackles this problem thanks to its in-depth automated and continuous diagnostics system that provides full understanding and data-driven maintenance tasks. Based on Artificial Intelligence and signal processing algorithms, DeepSolar gives (i) a very accurate low-error-rate breakdown of performance reduction sources, (ii) root cause analysis, which in turn will allow pinpointed actions to reduce this variation significantly, what turns into an increase of performance of low-performing PV field parts. Raycatch does not need additional hardware like sensors or data loggers, a key characteristic to boost its commercialisation. DeepSolar enables the identification and accurate diagnostic of the PV field together with actions to be taken in order to optimize the plants yield, all this on-going, automatically, and without human interpretation. We estimate the total Addressable Market for AI based solar diagnostics to be â‚¬100 million in 2020 and â‚¬500 million in 2024.

487,762442,Biofrigas,Turning manure into fuel: a container based LBG plant for small to medium scale farms,"The demand for renewable fuels is growing, mainly by increasing environmental concern, coupled with stringent government regulations pertaining to air pollution and waste management. 

Liquefied biogas (LBG) is an environmentally sustainable fuel. Livestock manure is also an excellent source of LBG, turning waste product into energy. However, currently, it is only possible to generate LBG through large scale plants. This means that it is not economically viable to utilize manure from small and medium sized farms, which makes up 40% of the total biogas production potential, as small, decentralized plants are currently not economically efficient. The major reason for this due to the lack of a commercially viable technology that can generate liquid biogas at a small scale. This means that less than 1% of the potential biogas production is being produced. 

Biofrigas Sweden AB has developed and piloted an effective, decentralised, small-scale and affordable, containerized energy plant that converts manure into 97% pure liquefied biogas (LBG) and separates the CO2 it contains. This has several advantages: 
-No need to transport sludge to LBG plant â€“ the plant is onsite; 
-Biogas produced is in liquefied form that allows easy storage and transportation, reducing transport costs by 84%
-The container is a temporary and moveable structure that allows an innovative financing model which does not require farmers to invest in the plant, therefore speeding up market penetration.

BFG plan to use the SME instrument to the Biofrigas LBG plant to the market. Should the feasibility study confirm current beliefs about the market and the technology, the aim is to use the phase 2 to complete, certify and demonstrate the commercial plant in small and medium farms in 4 European countries, before launching the BFG plant on the market in 2019.

488,721065,CREATE,Critical Raw materials Elimination by a top-down Approach To hydrogen and Electricity generation,"CREATE aims at developing innovative membrane electrode assemblies for low-temperature polymer-electrolyte fuel cell (FC) and electrolyzer (EL) with much reduced cost. This will be achieved via elimination or drastic reduction of critical raw materials in their catalysts, in particular platinum group metals (PGM).

Key issues with present low-temperature FC & EL are the high contents of PGM in devices based on proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) and the need for liquid electrolytes in alkaline FC and EL. To overcome this, we will shift from PEM-based cells to 1) pure anion-conducting polymer-electrolytes and 2) to bipolar-membrane polymer electrolytes. The latter comprises anion and proton conducting ionomers and a junction. Bipolar membranes allow adapting the pH at each electrode, thereby opening the door to improved performance or PGM-free catalysts. Both strategies carry the potentiality to eliminate or drastically reduce the need for PGM while maintaining the advantages of PEM-based devices.

In strategy 1, novel anion-exchange ionomers and membranes will be developed and interfaced with catalysts based on Earth-abundant metal oxides or metal-carbon composites for the oxygen reactions, and with ultralow PGM or PGM-free catalysts for the hydrogen reactions.

In strategy 2, novel bipolar membrane designs, or designs unexplored for FC & EL, will be developed and interfaced with catalysts for the oxygen reactions (high pH side of the bipolar membrane) and with catalysts for the hydrogen reactions (low pH side). The ionomers and oxygen reaction catalysts developed in strategy 1 will be equally useful for strategy 2, while identified PGM-free and ultralow-PGM catalysts will be implemented for the hydrogen reactions on the acidic side.

Market analysts estimate a compound annual growth rate of 18,7% and a total of 5,4 GW installed worldwide between 2013 and 2019. One of the main drivers for BIPV market growth in the EU is the increasingly demanding legislation related to energy performance in buildings. The large potential for energy savings in buildings led the EU Commission to adopt the 2010/31/EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings with the objective that all new buildings are Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) by 2020. Renewable energy technologies, and in particular the integration of photovoltaic systems in the building environment offer many possibilities to play a key role within the NZEB scenario. 

Despite this favorable framework for BIPV technology market uptake, initial estimations of BIPV market growth have been subsequently overestimated in the past few years. A series of demands from the stakeholders which have not been properly addressed by the BIPV value chain are the cause for this deviation. These key requirements are mainly related to the flexibility in design and aesthetics considerations, lack of tools integrating PV and building performance, demonstration of long-term reliability of the technology, compliance with legal regulations, smart interaction with the grid and cost effectiveness. Within this context:

The objective of PVSITES project is to drive BIPV technology to a large market deployment by demonstrating an ambitious portfolio of building-integrated solar technologies and systems, giving a forceful, reliable answer to the market requirements identified by the industrial members of the consortium in their day-to-day activity.

496,691689,BestRES,Best practices and implementation of innovative business models for Renewable Energy aggregatorS,"EuropeÂ´s electricity sector is in the midst of major transformation moving from public monopolies to competitive private companies in liberalized markets. The liberalization is expected to increase competition and thus increase cost-efficiency in energy production, transmission and distribution with the result of decreasing electricity prices. The efforts of Member State governments to create a more competitive and sustainable electricity sector are currently clouded by a major economic downturn in EuropeÂ´s economic activity. Such economic hardship often triggers reluctance to change which is becoming visible in particular in the electricity sector, where measures to protect jobs and national industry start to compete with market liberalization. The affordability of sustainable electricity is questioned.

There is a strong need for innovative business models for Renewable Energy Source (RES) electricity generation in the long and mid-term because support schemes will fade out in the long term pushing renewables on the market at no marginal costs which then in particular for strongly correlated generation as wind and PV leads to price deterioration during production hours. Already today many Member States have drastically reduced measures to further support the development of the RES sector, so that new investment is not possible without tapping new revenues with new business. 

The aim of the BestRES project is to identify best practices business models for renewable electricity generation in Europe and to improve these further taking into account new opportunities and synergies coming along with changing market designs in line with the EU target model. Business models investigated in this project shall make use of the aggregation of various renewable sources, storage and flexible demand. The improved business models will be implemented during the project in real-life environments, depending on the market conditions, to proof the soundness of the developed concept.",2016-03-01,2019-02-28,1994812.5,"['Storage', 'Wind']","['renewable energy', 'PV']",4,4

District cooling (DC) can play a part in satisfying this demand in a sustainable way (since can offer 5 to 10 times higher efficiency solutions than onâ€site standâ€alone distributed systems). Even if DC captures only minor portion of the prospective market, this will translate into a dramatic increase in the size of the global DC sector.
INDIGO aims to develop a more efficient, intelligent and cheaper generation of DC systems by improving system planning, control and management, anticipating the aforementioned scenario. This target will be achieved through the following specific objectives:
â€¢ Contribute to the wider use of DC systems and motivate the competiveness of European DC market by the development of two open-source tools:
o A planning tool for DC systems with the aim of supporting their optimal design
o A library with thermo-fluid dynamic models of DC System components which will provide the designers detailed information about their physical behaviour
â€¢ Primary energy reduction over 45% addressed by a ground breaking DC system management strategy focused mainly on energy efficiency maximization but also on energy cost minimization. Its main characteristics is the predictive management but it also will address other challenges such as:
o Integration of Renewable Energy Sources
o Dealing with different types of cooling sources 
o Suitable coupling between generation, storage and demand
All this, with the help of intelligent and innovative component controllers (Predictive Controllers) to be developed at all DC system levels. Some of them include embedded self-learning algorithms, allowing components to respond appropriately to the set-points established.

The project develops, integrates and demonstrates an easy to install and highly energy efficient solution for building retrofitting that begins from the Heat4Cool advanced decision-making tool (which addresses the building and district characteristics) and leads to the optimal solution combining (1) gas and solar thermally driven adsorption heat pumps, which permits the full integration with existing natural gas boilers to ensure efficient use of current equipment , (2) solar PV assisted DC powered heat pump connected to an advanced modular PCM heat and cold storage system, and (3) energy recovery from sewage water with high performance heat exchangers.
This retrofitting solution together with a closer interaction between building monitoring, demand/respond supply match, weather forecast and HVAC activation/control through a Self-Correcting Intelligent Building Energy Management Systems (SCI-BEMS) will save at least 10% of energy consumption.

499,737439,NuWaSim,On a Nuclear Waste Deep Repository Simulator,"Nuclear waste is generated during the operation and maintenance of nuclear power plants. The waste is first transferred to an interim storage, where it remains for tens of years, till radioactivity and heat generation of the spent fuel is reduced to a level that allows its final disposal. It is generally accepted that the final waste will be disposed of in a deep geological repository. However, not a single country worldwide has an operational underground repository. In the design process of these repositories, simulation tools capable to model their long term behavior (hundreds of years) are required. However, such simulations are extremely challenging, due to the complicated nature of the physical phenomena of multiscale and multiphysics nature. Current numerical tools being used by some of the most advanced deep repository projects use CODE_BRIGHT (developed at UPC-CIMNE), a very rich code in terms of modelling capabilities, which benefits from 20 years of intensive validation against in-situ experiments. However, CODE_BRIGHT is a serial structured FORTRAN 90 code with very limited capabilities in terms of parallel performance. As a result, actual analyses of prototypical deep repositories require strong and not validated simplification assumptions, in order to reduce by some orders of magnitude the computational cost of the target simulations. In this project, we want to change the situation by developing extremely scalable simulation software for nuclear waste management in repositories.  The strategy is to port CODE_BRIGHT modelling capabilities to FEMPAR, the extremely scalable scientific computing code that resulted from the Starting Grant COMFUS. The result of this work will be a new software that (1) produces the same results as CODE_BRIGHT for a wide set of benchmark tests (to validate the code), and (2) with proven excellent scalability on hundreds of thousands of processors.",2016-11-01,2018-04-30,149250.0,"['Storage', 'Fuel', 'Waste management']",['waste management'],4,4

The pilot sites are blocks of highly energy efficient buildings with a diverse range of renewable and cogeneration supply systems and requisite ICT infrastructure that allows direct testing of DR strategies. SIMBLOCKâ€™s main objectives are to specify the technical characteristics of the demand flexibility that will enable dynamic DR; to study the optimal use of the DR capability in the context of market tariffs and RES supply fluctuations; and to develop and implement market access and business models for DR models offered by blocks of buildings with a focus on shifting power to heat applications and optimization of the available energy vectors in buildings. Actions toward achieving these objectives include: quantifying the reliability of bundled flexibility of smaller buildings via pilot site monitoring schemes; combining innovative automated modelling and optimization services with big data analytics to deliver the best real time DR actions, including motivational user interfaces and activation programs; and developing new DR services that take into account the role of pricing, cost effectiveness, data policies, regulations, and market barriers to attain the critical mass needed to effectively access electricity markets.

The amount of electric power which can be supplied to the grid depends on the time of the day and weather conditions. A conventional fleet of thermal power plants is required to compensate for these fluctuations before large scale energy storage technologies will be mature and economically viable. All power market projections expect this to be the case for the next 50 years at least. For a strong expansion of renewables, this fleet has to operate flexibly at competitive cost.
Current power plants cannot fill this role immediately without impeding their efficiency and engine lifetime through increased wear and damage induced by the higher number of (shorter) operating/loading cycles. New technologies need to be introduced to  balance demand peaks with renewable output fluctuations at minimal fuel consumption and emissions without negative effects on cycling operation. The FLEXTURBINE partners have developed a medium to long term technology roadmap addressing future and existing power plants. The FLEXTURBINE project presented hereafter is the first step in such technology roadmap and consists of: (1) new solutions for extended operating ranges to predict and control flutter, (2) improved sealing and bearing designs to increase turbine lifetime and efficiency by reducing degradation/damages, and (3) an improved lifecycle management through better control and prediction of critical parts to improve competitive costs by more flexible service intervals and planned downtime, and by reducing unplanned outages. In all areas, individual technologies will be developed from TRL 3 to TRL 4-6.

Due to the currently applied technologies and related energy loss at each process step, wastewater treatment in Europe today consumes instead the equivalent of more than 2 power stations. Many operators are thus targeting incremental energy efficiency towards energy neutrality, but recent studies have shown that with novel process schemes using existing technologies, sewage treatment plants could actually become a new source of renewable energy, without compromising the treatment performance.
The project POWERSTEP aims at demonstrating such innovative concepts in first full scale references for each essential process step in order to design energy positive wastewater treatment plants with currently available technologies. The following processes will be demonstrated in 6 full-scale case studies located in 4 European countries: enhanced carbon extraction (pre-filtration), innovative nitrogen removal processes (advanced control, main-stream deammonification, duckweed reactor), power-to-gas (biogas upgrade) with smart grid approach, heat-to-power concepts (thermoelectric recovery in CHP unit, steam rankine cycle, heat storage concepts), and innovative process water treatment (nitritation, membrane ammonia stripping). These individual technology assessments will merge into integrative activities such as treatment scheme modelling and design, global energy and heat management, carbon footprinting, integrated design options, as well as extensive dissemination activities.

Especially hydrogen produced from RES will have a major part in decarbonizing the industry, transport and energy sector â€“ as feedstock, fuel and/or energy storage.

However, access to renewable electricity will also be a limiting factor in the future and energy efficient technologies the key. Due to a significant energy input in form of steam preferably from industrial waste heat, Steam Electrolysis (StE) based on Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) achieves outstanding electrical efficiencies of up to 84 %el,LHV. Thus, StE is a very promising technology to produce hydrogen most energy efficiently. 

GrInHy2.0 will demonstrate how steam electrolysis in an industrial relevant size can:

507,695094,Ocean artUp,Ocean Artificial Upwelling,"The productivity of the ocean is limited by the transport of nutrient-rich deep waters to the sun-lit surface layer. In large parts of the global ocean this transport is blocked by a temperature-induced density gradient, with warm light waters residing on top of heavier cold waters. These regions, which are referred to by scientists as ocean deserts, are presently expanding due to surface-ocean warming. Enhancing the upward transport of nutrient-rich deep waters through artificial upwelling can break this blockade and make these waters more productive. Forced upwelling of deep-ocean water has been proposed as a means to serve three distinctly different purposes: (1) to fuel marine primary production for ecosystem-based fish farming; (2) to enhance the oceanâ€™s biological carbon pump to sequester CO2 in the deep ocean; (3) to utilize the surface to deep-ocean temperature gradient to generate renewable energy via Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). Whereas theoretical and technical aspects of applying artificial upwelling for these purposes have been studied to some extent, the ecological responses and biogeochemical consequences are poorly understood. Ocean artUp therefore aims to study the feasibility, effectiveness, associated risks and potential side effects of artificial upwelling in increasing ocean productivity, raising fish production, and enhancing oceanic CO2 sequestration. This will be addressed through a combination of experiments at different scales and trophic complexities, field observations of eddy-induced upwelling in oligotrophic waters, and ecosystem-biogeochemical modelling of pelagic systems fertilized by nutrient-rich deep waters.

511,764090,EASY-RES,Enable Ancillary Services bY Renewable Energy Sources,"The stability and security of the traditional electrical power systems is largely based on the inherent properties of synchronous generators (SGs). Such properties are: the grid-forming capability, the inertia, the damping of transients, and the provision of large currents during faults. The growing penetration of converter-interfaced (thus inertia-less) Distributed Renewable Energy Sources (DRES) will eventually replace dispatchable SGs and increase power volatility, causing large frequency deviations and voltage regulation problems. The increase of SG spinning reserves, the grid reinforcement and the use of central electric energy storage systems are some solutions proposed to tackle this problem. However, due to their centralized approach and high cost, these actions can be undertaken only centrally by TSOs and DSOs. 
By adopting a unified bottom-up approach, EASY-RES will develop novel control algorithms for all converter-interfaced DRES, to enable them to operate similarly to conventional SGs, providing to the grid inertia, damping of transients, reactive power, fault ride through and fault-clearing capabilities, and adaptable response to primary and secondary frequency control. These new functionalities will be transparent to all grid voltage levels.
The EASY-RES approach is based on the distribution network segmentation into small Individual Control Areas, where the DRES and properly sized storage systems will be optimally coordinated via suitably designed ICT infrastructure to provide Ancillary Services (AS) such as inertial response, reactive power support, power smoothing, and contribution to fault-clearing in a bottom-up approach: prosumers and independent RES producers to DSOs, and DSOs to TSOs.

However, one of the main limitations of using solar power as an energy source is that the electricity must be used immediately or stored in a secondary device .   Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells combined in tandem with PV cells offer a solution to this problem by using solar radiation (light) to electrolyze water  and generate hydrogen which can then be converted to electricity using fuel cells or be used to synthesize and store hydrocarbon fuels by hydrogenation of CO2 .  The hostâ€™s (Prof. Avner Rothschild) research group at the Technion Institute of Technology in Israel has recently made a landmark advancement in the quest for efficient solar water splitting. The development of a resonant light trapping technique  in ultrathin absorbing films on reflective substrates opens the possibility to overcome the greatest challenge facing efficient water splitting in Î±-Fe2O3 photoanodes, namely, the trade-off between optical absorption length and charge carrier collection length.  The Experienced Researcher proposes a novel research plan building upon the invention and involving heteroepitaxial deposition of ultrathin Fe2O3 films for solar water splitting.  The proposed research is highly innovative and will develop methods for precise control of thin microstructures and their compositions; these will allow for engineering of films that are nearly free of defects which will improve the efficiency of the photoanodes by suppressing bulk recombination and at the same time, cover novel fundamental research directions such as study of doping on Î±-Fe2O3 properties without entanglement from microstructural effects, heteroepitaxial multilayer structures with selective charge transport layers, and directional charge transport in Î±-Fe2O3.",2015-10-01,2017-09-30,170509.2,['Fuel'],"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",3,4

An ideal solar cell requires low-cost, trouble-free, abundant material resources with good stability and high power conversion efficiency, also competent to integrate into large area. More recently, a research interest from the photovoltaic community has concentrated on organicâ€“inorganic halide perovskites and nowadays perovskite solar cells represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. These ambipolar semiconductors have attracted increasing attention due to their easy fabrication process and unique physicochemical properties like small band-gaps and high carrier mobility. 
	The inherent and unique physicochemical properties of perovskites are dependent on a variety of factors, including chemical composition, homogeneity, crystallinity and grain size-dispersion. All these factors are largely determined by the synthetic procedures used and sustained efforts have gone into the development of new efficient methods for perovskite preparation.
	Recently, chemical transformations driven by mechanical forces have appeared as a new emerging methodology in materials science. The mechanochemical reactions in solid state offer a significant advance by avoid the use of solvent, dramatically shortening synthesis times and simultaneously increasing the purity and amount of product. The main goal of this proposal is to develop mechanochemical methods for the preparation of a variety of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites and their composites with metal oxides nanoparticles.

DISC focuses on the only way to fully exploit the potential of silicon to its maximum: through the use of carrier selective junctions, i.e., contacts which allow charge carriers to be extracted without recombination.  Such contacts allow for simple device architecture as considered in DISC - non-patterned double-side contacted cells â€“ which can be fabricated within a lean process flow, either by upgrading existing or within future production lines. In DISC, a unique consortium of experienced industrial actors will collaborate with a set of institutes with demonstrated record devices and worldwide exceptional experience in the R&D field of carrier selective contacts. DISC will target efficiencies >25.5% on large area cell and >22% at module level while demonstrating pilot manufacturing readiness at competitive costs. 
Together with a reduction of non-abundant material consumption (Ag, In), with an enhancement of the energy yield, with modern module design ensuring outstanding durability, DISC will provide the key elements for achieving in Europe very low Levelized Costs of Electricity between 0.04 â€“ 0.07$/kWh (depending on the irradiation), with mid-term potential for further reduction, making solar one of the cheapest electricity source.

The consortium consists of six partners including two universities, two research institutes, and two companies from five different countries. The overall budget totals 2 Mâ‚¬, with individual budgets between 220 and 500 Tâ‚¬.
This project will utilize an electrochemical hydrogen purification (EHP) system. EHP has proven to produce high purity hydrogen (5N) while maintaining low energy consumption because the purification and optional compression are electrochemical and isothermal processes. A low CAPEX for the EHP system is feasible due to the significant reductions of system costs that result from recent design improvements and market introductions of various electrochemical conversion systems such as hydrogen fuel cells. 
In detail, the purification process will be a two-step process. A catalyst-coated proton exchange membrane will be assisted by one selectively permeable polymer membrane. Standard catalysts are sensitive to impurities in the gas. Therefore, alternative anode catalysts for the EHP cell, an anti-poisoning strategy and an on board diagnostic system will be developed. The resulting MEMPHYS system will be multi-deployable for purification of a large variety of hydrogen sources.
A valuable feature of the MEMPHYS system is the simultaneous compression of the purified hydrogen up to 200 bar, facilitating the transport and storage of the purified hydrogen.

Lightricity has already demonstrated up to 6x more power density (under indoor light) than conventional Silicon-based technology, on the macro-scale (~10cm^2 EH devices). The key innovations will be on extreme miniaturisation, implementation of cost-down processes and integration with complementary ultra-low power electronics and sensors.

On the technical side, we will focus on the mass-manufacturability of ultra-high efficient micro-scale EH components and on their 3D compact integration with ultra-low quiescent power management chip-sets, rechargeable storage elements (Lithium-free storage) and ultra-low power embedded microcontrollers (incl. ARM Cortex MCUs) for sensing and RF connectivity. The objective is to achieve the sellable product stage as soon as possible, by offering an ultra-compact, efficient and low-cost battery-less solution.

On the commercial side, we will investigate the technical and cost requirements amongst our end-users (ARM, Cambridge IQ, Ahead-of-the-Curve/AotC) and in the market, in order to validate Lightricityâ€™s technology for the most promising market segments (where there is a strong customer and technology pull): Retail (smart packaging and labels, anti-counterfeiting, smart payment cards), Industrial IoT (asset tracking, monitoring and positioning devices) and smart cities (environmental sensing, smart parking etc.).

Due to their efficient generation and local use of heat and electricity, their fuel saving- and CO2 reduction potential is tremendous. In spite of great interest of the market and policy-makers, currently available mCHP systems suffer from limited life, high investment and very high maintenance cost, making them too expensive for serious market uptake. 
MTT solves this problem with the EnerTwin, a mCHP system based on a micro gas turbine. The EnerTwin uses commercial off-the-shelf components resulting in low investment cost. Gas turbines are known for low-maintenance, high power density (small size) and long life. MTT uses automotive turbochargers as key components of the turbine: these are produced in millions and contribute to the low cost and high reliability of the EnerTwin. Gas turbines are inherently insensitive to varying fuel compositions facilitating use of various grades of natural gas. 
Currently, the EnerTwin is at TLR 7: 19 systems have been deployed in 1st-stage field tests at client locations since mid 2013. Besides the field-trial units, MTT has already sold 500 commercial EnerTwins, which promises an excellent commercial market perspective, while concrete contracts are under negotiation for high volumes for Canadian- and Chinese markets. 
The main objective of this project is the readiness for commercialisation of the EnerTwin. MTT and its industrial project partners will improve the mCHP to meet future CE and ECO Design requirements. Together with these partners, MTT will work on component and system optimisation for reliability and large-volume manufacturing. Additional field-test units will be deployed to test use cases and validate improvements.

Tâ€™AIR ENERGIES is a French SME which aims at bringing to market an innovative energetic model where the local biomass and waste are valorised to produce and distribute green hydrogen for mobility (fuel cell electric cars), energy (electricity/gas) and industrial applications. 
Our innovative solution, called Hydrogreen, is a pyrogasification-based process where biomass (wood, wood waste, straw) is converted, with optimum efficiency, into energetic hydrogen and decarbonated CO2. Our methodology proposes an integral process based on the valorisation of locally available material and agricultural surpluses through a decentralized process that guarantees huge savings in terms of logistical costs (-66%) for the system's inputs. In addition, thanks to the optimization of the resources used and the introduction of waste/products at the end of their life in the productive cycle, it is fully aligned with the principles of the circular economy. Finally, the distribution of H2, in which the traditional service stations are complemented with a personalized system where our logistics partners directly transport the fuel to the end users, solves a key mobility bottleneck, further boosting the growth of the number of vehicles based on clean hydrogen energy.

The growth/carbon sink relationship impacts metabolism, carbon partitioning and productivity but its regulation is poorly understood. Recently, we found a connection between two major cell growth regulators in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our findings revealed a synergistic effect between TOR kinase and Inositol polyphosphate (InsP) regulating lipid metabolism and the recycling process of autophagy. Based on the relevance of these results, we aim to find the mechanisms and the conditions in which this intersection takes place within the green lineage. In this sense, we have designed a straight-forward project including different goals. First, we will set novel analytical tools to evaluate the InsP level fluctuations in the presence of new TOR inhibitors and monitor the impact on autophagy flux and lipid metabolism in the model photosynthetic organisms Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana. Second, we want to identify the phosphorylation targets of InsPs using Kinome/P-phosphoproteome in a Chlamydomonas InsP-deficient mutant. This analysis will unravel the phosphorylation network of InsP signaling and will provide new insights about the role of InsP in the control of cell growth. Third, we will evaluate InsP levels, autophagy flux and lipid storage under nutritional stress to determine the InsP modulation response in plants and algae. Understanding this signaling pathway will impact metabolic engineering of food and biofuel crops to improve yields of high-value products including oils and lipids.

The EU 2006 Biofuel policy has clearly stated that the search for alternative pathways for renewable energy sources will result in considerable growth in biofuel technologies and industry sectors in the coming years. Therefore, sustainable, energy efficient and innovative technologies are needed to produce biofuels from a wide range of raw materials feedstocks while adhering to the societal, economic and environmental norms of the EU. As an alternative to this conflict, the exploitation of new materials, such as residual biomass of lignocellulosic nature and aquatic (microalgae), can be an important strategy for the reconciliation of economic growth and environmental sustainability in the long term. Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) produced from agricultural and forestry residues including, among others, sugarcane bagasse have been considered as a generous source, which does not compete with food requirements and is one of the most abundant and promising biomass sources in the world, obtained from the processing of sugarcane. Microalgae are primitive plant organisms with no roots, stems or leaves, that can be found in all terrestrial ecosystems. Microalgal biomass is frequently rich in fatty acids, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins, antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins such as riboflavin, thiamine, carotene and folic acid, among others are of high value. From the above, this project proposes the bioethanol production from a biomass mixture of the microalgae Chlorella zofingiensis and lignocellulosic hydrolysate sugarcane bagasse, focusing on the development of a fermentation technology to convert the pentoses and hexoses present in the biomass to bioethanol.",2019-06-01,2021-05-31,98507.52,['Fuel'],"['biofuel', 'renewable energy']",3,4
532,867602,IGP,Intelligent Grid Platform,"The energy sector is going through a transformation from a one directional centralized system in which energy is produced by a limited number of big power plants into a highly decentralized ecosystem due to the introduction of small-scale renewable energies and the electrification of mobility. In this situation, power distribution grid operatorsâ€™ current workflows and IT systems cause inconsistent data management which complicates their planning and operation activities. Therefore, essential grid planning and operation workflows involve significant manual input. As a result, e.g. the evaluation of a connection request for a single new wind turbine often takes multiple days. Additionally, Smart Grid Technologies cannot be used to their full extent to avoid curtailment of renewables in congestion management, and to substitute conventional expensive grid capacity expansions.
We have developed the Intelligent Grid Platform (IGP), the only integral software solution using machine learning algorithms to allow grid operators to reduce their operational and network expansion investment costs by giving them the means to clean and connect their data, digitize and automate their grid planning and operation activities and to more easily integrate smart grid technologies to help their operation processes and avoid expensive network capacity extensions. As a result, they save time and engineering resources by up to 70% and reduce grid operation and expansion costs by 40% to 60%.

However, it is still a raw sector with high risks and some companies are shutting down or reducing their projects due to the operating and maintenance costs of these plants.
eForcis and BeForcis are wave energy generators and represent the next stage of technology to harvest wave energy for the economic activity at sea, especially offshore. By focusing on low potential energy and the reduction of energy costs, our product will reduce carbon energy consumption and contribute to more efficient and competitive maritime economic activities. 
At SMALLE Technologies, SL, we are a high-tech company developing innovative energy harvesting devices. Our flagship product is the eForcis wave power generator, which is able to capture energy (between 2-10 Ah/day) from the sea waves. Our mission is to develop new methods of responsibly using renewable and sustainable energy sources to power off-grid devices. We offer reliable, high-quality and cost-effective products supported by extensive R&D. We want to reduce the carbon footprint of electricity production having a positive impact on the environment. 
The next steps in our company strategy are to increase the TRL6 of our eForcis equipment to reach a marketable product closely working with key clients in the buoy sectors, and to finalise and test the BeForcis technology (optimization of eForcis technology incorporating a buoy) to serve the wide aquaculture market.

In Arkyne Technologies S.L we defend that the climate change imperative dictates that we begin the transformation of our energy system right now just within our homes and businesses! We base our disruptive product within one of the latterly alternative energy sources proposed, Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC), which use special microorganismsâ€™ properties in an anaerobic anode compartment for production of bio-electricity.  
With BIOO we are exploiting the Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell (PMFC), which is characterised by the fact that the generation of such electricity is done by means of anaerobic bacteriological synthesis of the organic matter produced during plantsâ€™ photosynthesis. The introduction of BIOO panel into the market will have a positive impact on: i) the environment, by means of creating the greenest electricity ever, ii) the economy of our customers, by allowing them to obtain enough electricity for residential use at lower pay-backs than competitors and finally, iii) Arkyne Technologiesâ€™ economic growth, assuring an accumulated turnover during 4 year period around 13.2Mâ‚¬.  We are applying to the SME Instrument in order to obtain funding to carry out the technical and commercial activities required to obtain a marketable and ready to certify BIOO Panel system, as well as to create a demonstrative platform useful to act as a show-room for our clients.

ARPEâ€™s innovation is a game-changer business model integrating the life management of towels in fitness centers and other collectivities using a circular economy approach for delivering multiple life to the product and multiple economic valorization:
-	Production and sale of polyester microfiber towels for collectivities (SALE)
-	Recover those towels at the end of their life for recycling (TAKE-BACK)
-	Refurbish the towel into a new product for other sectors (SALE)
-	Potential for recycling the second product to fiber level and go back to fresh towel production (CIRCULAR RECYCLE) 
ARPE made a first demonstration with key stakeholders with 100 kg of end-of-life towels to turn them into 2500\ cleaning cloths. Based on the first tests, we estimate a total European market in the order of 48 million towels a year or the equivalent of 98 million â‚¬ for the primary market (towel sales). When taking into account the circularity of the process (taking back the initial product and refurbishing into a second product) the market potential is almost doubled to 176 million â‚¬.
We plan to assess the feasibility for the scale up of the ARPE-CIRCULAR-TOWEL model and its evolution from a product sale towards a â€œservitizationâ€ or towels-as-a-service business model.
The ARPE-CIRCULAR-TOWEL model will actively contribute to a more sustainable industrial production with reduced CO2 emissions, reduced water consumption and cost savings for all involved stakeholders and customers. 
During the first 5 years of commercial exploitation we estimate total accumulated sales of 15.7Mâ‚¬ and accumulated profits of over 5.9Mâ‚¬.

The main objective of MAIL is to trigger utilization of MLs as Carbon Sinks by activities related to forestry and agriculture. The project aims to detect and classify mountainous and semimountainous Marginal Lands (m/sm MLs), in order to deliver a web-based regional platform with data, methodology and applications which will be valuable for policy makers, stakeholders or researchers.
MAIL will assess MLsâ€™ presence, distribution and suitability in smart and efficient way, considering that marginality differs within European bioclimatic zones. It will detect MLs through multiple layer analysis of existing EU/Global scale datasets (land cover, land use, soil or climatic information, etc.) and will further examine, validate and classify MLs, through field stratified sampling, into Carbon sequestration capacity categories.
In pilot areas MAIL will augment the achieved accuracy by using enhanced spatial and radiometric resolution of full free and open access satellite datasets. Furthermore, it will propose actions that have to be taken in order to increase Carbon sequestration capacity and it will evaluate their feasibility by using a set of criteria for accurate cost estimation.

The challenging issue of achieving concomitantly high efficiency, high flexibility in operation and cost optimum is duly addressed through improvements of rSOC components (cells, stacks, power electronics, heat exchangers) and system, and the definition of advanced operation strategies. 
The specifications, detailed system design and the advanced operation strategies are supported by modelling tasks.
An in-field demonstration will be performed in a technological park, where the Smart Energy Hub will be coupled to local solar and mini-hydro renewable sources and will provide electricity and heat to the headquarters of the park. It will demonstrate, in a real environment, the high power-to-power round-trip efficiency of this technology and its flexibility in dynamic operation, thus moving the technology from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 6.

The company aims to build on successful sales to niche space and motorsport markets, by up-scaling CDC production, reducing costs, allowing for more ubiquitous adoption of their products for energy-saving applications in price-sensitive markets. Initially, Skeleton will fulfil explicit demand in the automotive industry for high current, high power/weight ultracapacitors, facilitating advances in stop-start, regenerative braking and cold starting technologies. Applications have also been identified in smart grids, supporting renewable energy sources and circumventing power outages.

Skeleton also plans to market its specially treated CDC materials to manufacturers of ultracapacitors and Li-ion capacitors, and to investigate further identified uses, such as in advanced batteries, gas adsorption, water desalination and as a catalyst in fuel cells.

The Phase I feasibility study will comprise two consecutive parts: 1) completion of the planning for the up-scaled CDC production facility (to be implemented in the 24 month Phase II project), and 2) conduction of collaborative consultation with other ultracapacitor manufacturers, who will be early adopters of the CDC.

The project will address the European and global challenge of developing low carbon and efficient energy systems.

These materials are key in transport systems, wind power and H storage. Despite the enormous economic significance, little is known fundamentally about the underlying damage mechanisms, which are inherently playing out on the atomic scale.

The PIâ€™s team will use atom probe tomography, an atomic scale 3D microscopy method to systematically analyse the location and pathways of H in the microstructure and shed light on damage mechanisms in Fe and Ni based materials. This will include vacancies/clusters (0D), dislocations (1D), interfaces (2D) and second phased (3D). The approach will be combined with micro-mechanics to investigate the involvement of H in fracture behaviour. We will measure the amount of H at dislocations required for enhanced plasticity, in the plastic wake of a crack and at the crack tip. In production materials, we will determine the amount of H at identified traps after processing as well as penetration pathways into the material. Finally, we will clarify the contribution of H to a important problem for wind power generation: white-etching cracks.

These experiments are now made possible in a commercial atom probe by using 2H (D) charging combined with cryo specimen transfers to avoid H loss. In the project, the team will go a step further and build an atom probe with ultra-low H background to enable the direct detection of 1H, enabling analysis without tracers.

The aim of this project is to provide new experimental insight into the function of photovoltaic (PV) systems and optimize the geometrical parameters to improve their efficiency. The goal structures will be achieved based on three different elements: a) nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) films, b) atomic layer deposition (ALD) of inorganic semiconductors, and c) the use of organic semiconductors as hole transporter materials and bulk heterojunctions. Nanoporous AAO will be used as template due to the great geometrical flexibility achievable, diameter = 20 - 400 nm; interpore distance = 50- 500 nm; length = 0.1 - 10 um, in self-ordered domains of nanopores. The ALD will be used to coat homogeneously the nanochannels of the AAO with electron conductor materials (TiO2) and light absorber (Sb2S3). The thickness of these layers will be ranging from 5 to 50 nm.  Finally, organic hole transporter materials and bulk heterojunction will be infiltrated into the nanochannels in contact with the light absorber to form coaxial organic-inorganic heterojunctions in arrays hexagonally ordered nanochannels.

The D&D process of nuclear infrastructures demands methods for a full traceability of waste material to improve quality management and operational safety. Precise procedures provide twofold benefits: the optimization of costs, associated with D&D, and the minimization of the dose exposure to operators and personnel.
The absence of a consistent and straightforward solution to characterize all types of materials, along with the lack of an integrated solution for digitizing the enormous amount of data produced, is a critical issue. Now the systems rely on the operatorâ€™s ability to maintain high operational skills and quality assurance with precision measurements that unfortunately today very often are associating high uncertainties not allowing therefore a real optimization of the waste.

It can be said that rarely any progress in a technology where all basic processes are understood did depend so much on characterization than electrochemical energy storage systems. The mean figures of merit (specific energy per mass, volume or cost unit, cyclability) can all theoretically be substantially improved, under the condition of a proper understanding of where and how their limits are reached in todayâ€™s industrialized systems.

The equipment recycles dirty plastic waste by thermal depolymerisation, thus recasting it into ecological oil and process gas with immediate further multi-purpose usage. Leitner is a mobile technology, suitable also for small operations optimally processing 1 thousand tonnes of dirty plastic waste per day. 
The applicant has produced prototypes of the green technology and has tested them now in industrially relevant environment (real operation). 
The equipment weight is 2,500 kg, forming a container assembly (dimensions: 8m x 3m x 3m), which can be easily connected/disconnected. The existing prototype produces 1 litre of oil from each kilogram of dirty plastic waste. For the production of 1 litre of an ecological oil, the technology requires 1 kWh energy. 
The project intention is in line with EU endeavours to support SMEs in areas addressing the climate action, environment, green growth potential and raw material challenge.

From total amount 100 million tonnes is hazardous, containing heavy metals and other toxins. These substances make the waste particularly difficult to treat, as special processes are needed to deal with the hazardous components.

Moreover, the use of gasification technology allows obtaining synthetic gas during the gasification process, which in turn can be used as a source of alternative energy for heat production. By using EUWaste, waste producers (e.g. health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, petrochemical factories, etc.) and waste utilizers can improve their waste management and help to reduce health and environmental problems, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid negative impacts at local level such as landscape deterioration due to landfilling, local water and air pollution, as well as littering.

Electrochemical energy storage systems will constitute an essential element in the development of sustainable energy technologies, considering that the SCs can deliver energy quickly, can be recharged in seconds, and can withstand cold temperatures, shocks or vibrations. They also contain earth-abundant and nontoxic materials, so they are much environmentally friendly than today's batteries are. However, to take advantage of all opportunities that market offers, it is necessary that some technical capabilities of the SCs improve. While the currently available energy density is acceptable for applications such as emergency doors, memory backup and so on, limited energy density is widely perceived as the main impediment to growth of its sustainable energy applications. Therefore, much research and development has focussed on increasing SCs energy density at assumable price.
Xerolutions designs and manufactures engineered carbon porous materials for SCs. Our Technology Platform controls the porosity structure adapting the size of pores for electrolytes ions dimensions to ensure high capacitance values and good charge propagations, especially at high loads. In this way Xerolutions materials achieve to increase the energy density of SCs while maintaining their high power capability, therefore the total device cost per unit of energy stored is reduced. Xerolutions has developed XER-HSA products range that is formed by open porosity carbons materials especially suitable to SCs which use different types of electrolytes. At present, Xerolutions has a plant with a production capacity in-batch of about a few kilos per day, so we would need to scale up the process and to automate each production step.",2015-06-01,2015-11-30,50000.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,4

The EU priority of increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources in the power system has led to the wide acceptance of the smart grid paradigm as the solution for several emerging challenges. Another EU priority is the creation of a Pan-European Energy Market. A relevant step was taken in 2015 with the coupling of several regional European markets. Despite the significant investments in the fields of smart grids and electricity markets, the two fronts are evolving quite independently from each other, evidencing the sector difficulties in profiting from the strong relationships among them. A relevant drawback is the lack of decision support solutions to enable involved players improving their outcomes from energy transactions. ADAPT tackles this gap by proposing a multi-agent decision support system to assist the negotiation process of smart grid and electricity market players. ADAPT is composed by: (i) a portfolio optimization that identifies the most gainful negotiation opportunities, considering the available markets, including negotiations at a smart grid level; and (ii) a decision support method for actual negotiations using novel machine learning approaches to choose the most suitable strategies for each context, considering opponentsâ€™ negotiation profiles. ADAPTâ€™s quality and industry-driven nature is assured by the experience and complementary expertise of the candidate and host in the targeted fields, and is further enhanced by the participation of experts in the fields of artificial intelligence and power systems.

A commercialisation process for FC buses is underway, through which a shared vision has been agreed between vehicle suppliers and their customers. This is based on reducing costs through scale via a phased approach of pre-commercial demonstrations that will provide the evidence for wider uptake of these vehicles in the 2020s.

The first step in upscaling FC bus deployment is underway through the JIVE project, which began in January 2017. JIVE 2 is its successor and is Europeâ€™s most ambitious FC bus project to date: 152 buses in 14 cities across seven countries. JIVE 2 involves regions with experience of the technology scaling up fuel cell bus fleets (e.g. Cologne), and those seeking to build their knowledge and experience by demonstrating FC buses in small fleets for the first time (e.g. Auxerre, GÃ¤vleborg). All deployment locations in JIVE 2 share an ambition to increase the size of their FC bus fleets following successful initial demonstrations, hence the participating cities/regions will be natural locations for larger scale roll-out of the technology in the 2020s.

A comprehensive data monitoring and assessment exercise will capture the relevant evidence to inform next steps for the sector, and the projectâ€™s impacts will be maximised by a high-impact dissemination campaign. This will involve reaching wide audiences via various channels, including a series of international Zero Emission Bus Conferences.

To evaluate the scientific tasks to be covered by TRANSAT, all the open issues of the tritium cycle that are not yet tackled by European research activities or former studies have been determined. This general picture has been constrained to crosscutting fusion and fission activities. 
Concerning release mechanism, tritium migration/permeation in massive samples are studied in dedicated rigs. Associated modelling takes place in the project in order to improve the level of confidence in predictive tools developed for tritium behavior in reactors. A special insight is also put in the release of tritium from tritiated particles coming from dismantling activities. Permeation barriers (active barriers and coating concepts) as well as treatment of the operational tritiated gases are assessed and their applicability to fusion and fission purposes is analyzed. Improvement in waste management is also covered by means of new concept studies for tritiated waste confining packages and by new accurate methodologies for tritium inventory assessment in metallic and soft house-keeping waste. Finally, a dedicated part of the project focuses on radiotoxicity, radioecology, radiobiology and dosimetry on tritiated particles produced during dismantling whose impacts have not yet been addressed. 18 Partners are participating in TRANSAT from all the European countries involved in tritium activities.

COZMOS will develop an energy-efficient and environmentally and economically viable conversion of CO2 to fuels and high added value chemicals via an innovative, cost effective catalyst, reactor and process. The concept will combine the sequential reactions of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and methanol to C3 hydrocarbons, exploiting Le Chatelier's principle to overcome low equilibrium product yields of methanol. Complete conversion of CO2 to a 85 % yield of C3 hydrocarbons will be achieved by using an optimised bifunctional catalyst within a single reactor. The optimised catalyst will allow the combined reactions, that currently run at disparate temperatures and pressures, to operate in a temperature/pressure 'sweet spot', which will reduce infrastructure and provide energy and production cost savings. The concept will allow tunable production of propane, an easily stored fuel used for heating, cooking and transportation, and the more valuable product propene, a base chemical primarily polymerised to lightweight plastics, depending on location, amount of available renewable energy and economic needs. The integrated technology will be demonstrated at TRL5 on off-gases from the energy intensive steel and refinery industries. Markets for both propane and propene are expected to grow in the coming years, such that the COZMOS technology will contribute to achieving a Circular Economy and diversified economic base in carbon-intensive regions.

To ensure a high long-term impact, the project will validate the use of state-of-the-art molecular-beam-epitaxy processes for fabrication of economically viable ultra-high efficiency solar cells. The ultimate efficiency target is to reach a level of 55%. This would enable to generate renewable/ecological/sustainable energy at a levelized production cost below ~7 Â¢/kWh, comparable or cheaper than fossil fuels. The work will also bring a new breath of developments for more efficient space photovoltaic systems. 

AMETIST will leverage the leading position of the applicant in topical technology areas relevant for the project (i.e. epitaxy of III-N/Bi-V alloys and key achievements concerning GaInNAsSb-based tandem solar cells). Thus it renders a unique opportunity to capitalize on the group expertize and position Europe at the forefront in the global competition for demonstrating more efficient and economically viable photovoltaic technologies.",2017-01-01,2021-12-31,2492719.0,,"['renewable energy', 'photovoltaic']",2,4
567,694101,FUTURE-PRINT,Tuneable 2D Nanosheet Networks for Printed Electronics,"In the future, even the most mundane objects will contain electronic circuitry allowing them to gather, process, display and transmit information. The resulting vast network, often called the Internet of Things, will revolutionise society. To realise this will require the ability to produce electronic circuitry extremely cheaply, often on unconventional substrates. This will be achieved through printed electronics, by the assembly of devices from solution (i.e. ink) using methods adapted from printing technology. However, while printed electronics has been advancing rapidly, the development of new, nano-materials-based inks is required for this area to meet its true potential.
We believe recent developments in liquid exfoliation of 2D nanosheets have given us the ideal family of materials to revolutionise electronic ink production. Liquid exfoliation can transform layered crystals into suspensions of nanosheets in very large quantities. In this way we can produce liquid-dispersed nanosheets of a wide range of types including conducting (e.g. graphene, MXenes, TiB2 etc), semiconducting (e.g. MoS2, WSe2, GaS, Black phosphorous etc), insulating (e.g. BN, talc) or electrochemically active (e.g. MoO3, Ni(OH)2, MnO2 etc). These nanosheets can be deposited from liquid to form porous networks of defined electronic type. While these networks have huge applications potential, a large amount of work must be done to translate them into working printed devices.
In this project, we will develop methods to transform large volume suspensions of exfoliated nanosheets into bespoke 2D inks with properties engineered for a range of specific printed device applications. We will learn to use this 2D ink to print patterned or large area 2D nanosheet networks with controlled structure, allowing us to tune the electrical properties of the network during printing. We will combine networks of different nanosheet types into complex heterostructures. This will allow us to print all device components (electrodes, active layers, dielectrics, energy storage layers) from one contiguous, multi-component network. In this way we will produce 2D network transistors, solar cells, displays and energy storage systems. FUTURE-PRINT will revolutionise electronic inks and will offer a new path forward for printed electronics.",2016-11-01,2021-10-31,2213316.88,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,4
568,706744,COLIBRI,Carrier-selective contacts for silicon photovoltaics based on broadband-transparent oxides,"This project aims at a cost-effective efficiency enhancement of Si solar cells towards their theoretical maximum of about 29% by moving away from the diffused-junction paradigm. This will reduce the energy fabrication costs on the â‚¬/kWh level and thereby increase the competiveness and profitability of photovoltaic systems. Crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cells are since decades the most established photovoltaic technology. Their main advantages are long lifetime (>25 years), non-toxicity and the high abundance of Si. However, for full competitiveness with traditional sources of electricity, important new steps need to be taken to increase their performance. 
An innovative contacting scheme will be developed that eliminates the main loss mechanisms in c-Si solar cells arising from doped pn-junctions and the direct contact of metal with Si. The novel contacts will be broadband optically transparent, generate a highly passivating and carrier-selective interface to Si and will enable solar cells without doped pn-junctions. No cost-intensive patterning technique is required for the device fabrication and parasitic optical absorption, as present in Si heterojunction solar cells, will be minimized. The novel contacts consist of three layers: a 1-2 nm thick tunnelling SiO2 layer for chemical passivation of the Si surface, a wide-bandgap conductive metal oxide layer providing a specific energy band alignment, and a highly conductive transparent oxide (TCO) for carrier transport to external metal contacts and optimum light coupling into the solar cell device. The contacts will be used for the fabrication of Si solar cells which are devoid of doped pn-junctions and achieve both high open-circuit voltages and photo currents. The structure of the photovoltaic device will be optimized for the application in regular 1-sun modules and for both III-V/Si and perovskite/Si tandem cell applications with potential for flat-plate efficiencies well above 30%.",2016-06-01,2018-05-31,175419.6,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,4

The emplacement of granitic bodies produces thermal anomalies that, under specific conditions of water availability and permeability, may generate valuable geothermal reservoirs providing relatively low cost renewable energy. 
Recent technological advances have revealed that granites and their corresponding volcanic rocks are commonly characterised by compositional and temporal heterogeneity at the mineral-scale. In this project, textural information, mineral-scale geochemical-geochronological data and thermo-mechanical numerical modelling are integrated to decode the thermochemical evolution of granites buried below the productive Larderello-Travale geothermal field (Italy). Zircon crystals will be dated by U-Pb high-precision techniques and analysed for stable (oxygen) and radiogenic (hafnium) isotopes as well as for trace elements. These multi-analytical approach will allow defining the tempo of the chemical and isotopic evolution of the system. The age distribution of zircons will be used in combination with thermal modelling to retrieve the temperature-time history of the magmatic reservoir. Further numerical simulations will investigate the fluid-dynamics of magma replenishment and will be performed during a four month secondment period. 
Overall, the project combines cutting-edge techniques with an innovative conceptual approach to produce a temporally-resolved, thermally-constrained petrogenetic model for the Larderello-Travale granites and to define the physico-chemical evolution of a shallow-level magmatic reservoir. This information constitutes an essential background knowledge for the understanding and possibly exploitation of geothermal fields, complementing my current geochemical expertise with a physical perspective on crustal magmatism.",2016-05-01,2018-04-30,187419.6,,"['geothermal', 'renewable energy']",2,4

These factors could change the idoneity of traditional forestry in Scots pine forests (which cover important areas in Europe). The projectÂ´s objectives are: 1) To characterize past and estimate future effects of forest management and climate change on carbon and nutrient budgets in Pinus sylvestris stands in SW Europe, to support sustainable forestry that maximizes nutrient and carbon use efficiency and therefore tree growth; 2) To develop, evaluate and apply reliable ecologically-based mathematical models that can be applied in forest management, to study interactions among elevated atmospheric CO2, tree growth and limiting nutrients and moisture. To achieve these objectives the project will be implemented in three stages: 1) Field and archival samples form experimental plots in Scot pine stands in the Pyrenees will be used to analyze connections between soil, leaf and stem nutrient status in the last 16 years. The magnitude of ecosystem biomass and nutrient pools will be estimated to calculate the historical change of nutrient use efficiency by the pines. Historical leaf NUE will be estimated through leaf area scanning combined with chemical analysis. Stem water and nutrient status will be estimated by wood scanning combined with techniques discriminating isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. 2) The ecosystem model FORECAST-Climate will be calibrated, validated, and used as a virtual lab to test the relative importance of nutrient, water, and CO2 availability on tree growth. 3) A battery of climate change (temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration) and forest management scenarios will be simulated to assess their long-term consequences and provide guidelines on the potential consequences of each management option.",2016-03-01,2018-02-28,170121.6,,"['carbon sequestration', 'forest management']",2,4

The concept, which has already undergone trial tank testing with overly positive results, shall enable a radical cost reduction both in terms of material usage and required means and operations. 

The system has been conceived in a holistic approach to the overall substructure, tower and turbine, generating ground breaking synergies between the integrated elements to specifically address the particular requirements of offshore wind, focusing in the capacity for low-cost industrialization in the inshore construction and offshore installation processes. 

The Telwind concept integrates a novel floating substructure and a pioneer self-erecting telescopic tower. The former provides all the performance advantages of a spar-buoy substructure while allowing for qualitatively lower material usage, the latter enables a full onshore preassembly of the overall system and a highly beneficial reduction of offshore works and auxiliary means. Together they overcome the limitations imposed by the available inshore infrastructure and offshore heavylift vessels, and thus generate a fully scalable system, perfectly fitted for the effective integration of the next generation of extremely large (10MW\) offshore wind turbines which are key to enhance the reduction of the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). 
The system will also profit from the proven structural efficiency and economy of precast concrete, a material particularly well suited for low-cost industrialized production of repetitive units. Robust, reliable and virtually maintenance-free marine constructions result, reducing OPEX costs, greatly increasing durability and fatigue tolerance, and setting the ground for extended service life of the infrastructure, which could further magnify the systemâ€™s capacity for drastic reduction of the LCOE.",2015-12-01,2018-11-30,3498530.0,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,4

Shifting towards a low-carbon economy requires cost-effective carbon capture solutions to be developed, tested and deployed. Current solutions do not offer sufficient performances. Adsorption processes are promising alternatives for capturing CO2 from power plants and other energy intensive industries as cement, steel, or petrochemical industries. In this regard, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a widely studied class of porous adsorbents that offer tremendous potential, owing to their large CO2 adsorption capacity and high CO2 affinity. However, the performances of MOF-based carbon capture technologies have not been fully evaluated. MOF4AIR gathers 14 partners from 8 countries to develop and demonstrate the performances of MOF-based CO2 capture technologies in power plants and energy intensive industries. After identifying the best MOFs in WP1 and validating them through tests (e.g. stability and selectivity) in WP2, the most promising will be produced at larger scale and shaped in WP3. WP4 will conduct simulations to study MOFs behaviours in two adsorption processes: VPSA and MBTSA and optimise them. Both solutions will be tested at lab scale in WP5. In WP6, 3 demonstration sites across Europe will prove the cost-efficiency and reliability of MOF-based carbon capture in CO2 intensive sectors: power supply, refineries and waste incineration. To ensure a wide development of the solutions developed, WP7 will focus on techno-economic analysis, LCA and WP8 on social acceptance and replicability. MOF4AIR aims to foster the uptake of CCS technologies by providing a TRL6-reliable solution matching end users' needs, notably by cutting CCS energy penalty by more than 10%. The solutions developed will be highly replicable thanks to the consideration of a wide range of carbon intensive sectors and clusters, notably through the project's Industrial Cluster Board.",2019-07-01,2023-06-30,9947143.16,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,4

In Europe, a steady movement towards application of renewable energy is taking place. However, segments where temporary portable power supply are needed, the use of renewable energy proves more difficult and fuel generators are the dominant off-grid solution. The use of conventional generators is commonplace in the construction sector, predominantly running on gasoline or diesel. Although functional, the rate of CO2 and NOx emissions produced by fossil combustibles poses a challenge to conventional generators in view of the late European policies.

This has a clear huge technological and economic impact on the market that can be estimated in 180 MEuro/year of losses, by considering a conservative amount of 30 GWp of new installations in the World per year. If cracking cannot be avoided due to the brittleness of Silicon, the proposed idea to be taken to proof of concept is to limit its effect as much as possible. A new generation of PV modules displaying a superior resistance against cracking is proposed, starting from the fundamental discovery within the CA2PVM ERC StG project that residual thermo-mechanical compressive stresses in Silicon cells are beneficial to induce crack face contact and electric recovery. An innovative pre-stressing technique will be designed to increase the residual compressive stresses in Silicon and achieve the crack closure state for any crack and therefore avoid electrical power-losses.

A closer attention to the demand side of the system is required, and especially in the interaction with the new methods for SG management.
Efficient power systems require the optimal use of the available resources to cope with demand requirements and Demand Response (DR) programs with adequate business models can leverage demand flexibility both on centralized and distributed models, as renewable energygeneration is highly dependable of uncontrolled factors (as wind and solar radiation) for which anticipated forecasts are hardly trustful.

If deep geothermal energy from EGSs becomes a significant cornerstone in future energy strategy, there is an urgent need to provide cost-efficient and novel drilling technologies and concepts in order to open up new European geothermal reservoirs for energy exploitation.

Therefore the overall goal of ThermoDrill is the development of an innovative drilling system based on the combination of conventional rotary drilling with water jetting that will allow at least 50% faster drilling in hard rock, a cost reduction of more than 30% for the subsurface construction and a minimized risk of induced seismic activity.

In order to achieve these goals ThermoDrill will mainly address the following research and development topics:

â€¢ HT/HP crystalline rock jetting and drilling fluids;
â€¢ systematic redesign of the overall drilling process, particularly the casing design and cementing;
â€¢ evaluation of drilling technologies and concepts in terms of HSE (health, safety and environmental) compliance.

The focus on business cases will demonstrate significant advances in bringing EGS derived energy (TRL6-7) routinely to market exploitation, and has potential to mobilise project outcomes to full market scales following the end of DEEPEGS project. We seek to understand social concerns about EGS deployments, and will address those concerns in a proactive manner, where the environment, health and safety issues are prioritised and awareness raised for social acceptance. We will through risk analysis and hazard mitigation plans ensure that relevant understanding of the risks and how they can be minimised and will be implemented as part of the RTD approaches, and as a core part of the business case development.",2015-12-01,2019-11-30,19999740.88,,"['geothermal', 'geothermal power']",2,4
586,654013,LoCO2Fe,Development of a Low CO2 Iron and Steelmaking Integrated Process Route for a Sustainable European Steel Industry,"Over the past decade, the steel industry in Europe has been spending a lot of effort in Research and Development of technologies that help in achieving the EUâ€™s CO2 emissions targets and reduce the cost of EU ETS compliance. That has been done through a combination of large scale projects which were part publicly funded with European funding and partly through smaller privately funded research activities.

From the initial stages of feasibility studies, several technologies were put forward for further development, one of which is the HIsarna smelting reduction process

The objective for the current proposal is to prove the capability of the HIsarna ironmaking technology to achieve at least 35% reduction in CO2 emission intensity, compared to blast furnace operated site based on Best Available Technology Currently Installed. This will be achieved through:

-Change operation parameters in order to achieve at least 35% CO2 intensity reduction per tonne of hot rolled coil compared to the conventional blast furnace â€“ BOF route through:
   >Combined iron ore and scrap operation with a scrap rate of 350kg/thm;
   >Partially replacing coal injection with sustainable biomass injection (at least 40%);
   >Minimising coal rate by maximising energy use in the reactor, through balancing the energy between the upper and lower part of the reactor (<700 kg coal per tonne hot metal in pilot reactor);
   >Using limestone instead of burnt lime as a fluxing agent;
   >Quantifying potential for energy recovery from hot off-gas by installing boiler test panels;
   >Making the process â€˜CCS readyâ€™ by having process gas suitable for CCS with little or no processing by replacing compressed air and N2 carrier gasses with CO2 and CH4 as carrier gas;
-Operation of the HIsarna pilot plant for several months continuously in order to establish process and equipment stability; 
-Test process conditions and validate for scale up to 0.8 Mtpa plant",2015-05-01,2018-10-31,7418415.02,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,4
587,648518,SUPERCELL,Single-Use paPER-based fuel CELLs,"The advances in paper microfluidics taking place in recent years show that the new generation of paper-based devices will be able to overcome the limitations of traditional lateral flow tests and offer more accurate and specific information. However, the quantification of paper devices signals by colorimetry, electrochemistry or fluorescence entails the use of sensors and electronic components that require energy to function. Up to now, this has been solved by the use of battery-powered bulky readers, but this is only cost-effective when the reader is meant to be used thousands of times (hospital, care rooms, etc). It is becoming clear that the proliferation of paper-based sensors and their enormous potential impact when applied to personalized healthcare ask for innovative solutions that provide affordable readout. Despite dedicated on-chip solutions that integrate all the required components within a disposable test seem to be the most promising approach, available examples of realization are still scarce. 
The SUPERCELL project aims to develop a new generation of disposable and low environmental impact  fuel cells. The approach presented in this proposal will be a major breakthrough in the fuel cell field, as these devices are conceived for the first time as single-use and disposable power sources. It will also have an enormous impact in the point-of-care diagnostics domain, as it will provide simple, reliable and clean power sources to an upcoming generation of smart paper-based sensors and allow them to be energetically autonomous. Fuel will be harvested from the biological sample to be analyzed â€“ in case of urine and blood â€“ or taken from hydrogen produced in situ upon the addition of any liquid in the paper platform.  The proposal is very innovative in conception as well as in technology as these devices will be developed by means of a smart integration of paper microfluidics, printed electronics and electrocatalysis technologies.",2015-07-01,2020-06-30,1920738.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,4
588,647719,Supramol,Towards Artificial Enzymes: Bio-inspired Oxidations in Photoactive Metal-Organic Frameworks,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are key compounds related to energy storage and conversion, as their unprecedented surface areas make them promising materials for gas storage and catalysis purposes. We believe that their modular construction principles allow the replication of key features of natural enzymes thus demonstrating how cavity size, shape, charge and functional group availability influence the performances in catalytic reactions. This proposal addresses the question of how such novel, bio-inspired metallo-supramolecular systems can be prepared and exploited for sustainable energy applications. A scientific breakthrough that demonstrates the efficient conversion of light into chemical energy would be one of the greatest scientific achievements with unprecedented impact to future generations. We focus on the following key aspects:

a) MOFs containing novel, catalytically active complexes with labile coordination sites will be synthesised using rigid organic ligands that allow us to control the topologies, cavity sizes and surface areas. We will incorporate photosensitizers to develop robust porous MOFs in which light-absorption initiates electron-transfer events that lead to the activation of a catalytic centre. In addition, photoactive molecules will serve as addressable ligands whereby reversible, photo-induced structural transformations impose changes to porosity and chemical attributes at the active sites. 

b) Catalytic studies will focus on important oxidations of alkenes and alcohols. These reactions are relevant to H2-based energy concepts as the anodic liberation of protons and electrons can be coupled to their cathodic recombination to produce H2. The studies will provide proof-of-concept for the development of photocatalytic systems for the highly endergonic H2O oxidation reaction that will be explored using most stable MOFs.  Further, gas storage and magnetic properties that may also be influenced by light-irradiation will be analysed.",2015-09-01,2020-08-31,1979366.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,4

The aim is to demonstrate the lower cost of small-scale production of electricity and heat in wider areas with various geological environments, in order to support a large increase of geothermal-based production sites in Europe in a near future. 
In order to boost the market penetration of geothermal power in Europe, MEET project main goal is to demonstrate the viability and sustainability of EGS with electric and thermal power generation in all kinds of geological settings with four main types of rocks: granitic (igneous intrusive), volcanic, sedimentary and metamorphic with various degrees of tectonic overprint by faulting and folding. 
MEET brings together 16 European partners: Industrials, small and medium enterprises, research institutes and universities, but also several geothermal demonstration sites in Europe located in the various geological environments described above. The project aims at the optimization of the reservoir productivity and stimulation techniques, taking advantage of the existing infrastructures, the understanding of the various geological contexts, necessary to transfer the current known EGS technology to other typical basement rock situations in Europe, the demonstration and optimization of electric and thermal power generation in different geological settings.
The assessment of the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of EGS is an integral part of the project, as well as the mapping of the main promising European sites where EGS can or should be implemented in a near future.

However, their widespread use is restricted by low energy storage density and relatively high effective series resistance. For the purpose of achieving high-performance supercapacitors, it is extremely imperative to design novel electrode materials with rational structure and composition for meeting the requirements of ideal electrodes. Currently although great progress has been achieved for carbon-based supercapacitors, which are still limited by complicated or environmentally-unfriendly synthesis procedure, unsatisfied structure and low energy density, it is still remaining a grand challenge to prepare heteroatoms-doped three-dimensional (3D) carbon network as supercapacitive electrodes with superior electrochemistry performances via a low-cost, easily scalable and eco-friendly methods. To achieve this goal, inspired by the features of intumescent flame retardants (IFRs), including rich in heteroatoms (N, P), thermos-crosslinking, tailored composition and easy carbonization to form porous char, a self-assembling and self-activation strategy is proposed to produce N/P Dual-doped 3D Carbon Network by nano-CaCO3 template-assistant carbonization of IFRs. In this project, by taking the advantages of IFRs, further combining the characters of nano-CaCO3, as hard template to construct 3D framework, also as activating agent for creating pores, the prepared 3D carbon will be expected as a promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. The project is in line with the current European research trends and societal needs, and will bring great academic value and economic benefits.

Valuable Raw Materials disposed in landfills are mostly lost due to inefficient waste management practices. Existing knowledge, reporting standards and inventory on SRM seems to be inefficient.  In this context, the SMART GROUND project intends to foster resource recovery in landfills by improving the availability and accessibility of data and information on Secondary Raw Materials (SRM) in the EU, while creating synergies among the different stakeholders involved in the SRM value chain. 
SMART GROUND involves the 3 main players of the process: End-users (waste management companies),RTD institutions (Research centres, Universities, SMEs), and Technology Transfer providers (Networking, training organizations and public authorities). Thus, the consortium will integrate all the data from existing databases and new information retrieved in a single EU databank. SMART GROUND will respond to the needs of coordination, networking and cooperation between stakeholders, through the creation of a databank enabling the exchange of information among them. It will improve data gathering on SRM from different types of waste, by defining new and better data acquisition methods and standards; it will cooperate with other EU ongoing activities and support the implementation of the EIP on RM.

One of the major problems is to have secondary raw material similar to virgin one. This is because of contamination, treatments, and so on, that lowen product performance.
The REACT proposal will address the management of waste acrylic textiles coming from outdoor awnings and furnishing. A clue issue is the analysis and removal of finishing substances (fluorocarbons, melamine and acrylic resins, anti-mold agents) that affect the secondary raw material purity and their management. Then a mechanical recycling process will be implemented to obtain second life fiber and fabrics, which performance will be tested for best application.
A full environment friendly process to remove hazardous materials on finishing of waste acrylic textile will be investigated and developed to enhance their recycling, improve sustainability and reduce environmental and health risk. The removing of finishing products via chemical reaction will involve the combination of many factors and has never been studied in this sector.
Final goal is a fully compatible recycled acrylic textile for reuse and guidelines for hazardous chemicals removing from finished textile with innovative investigation techniques.
The main objectives of this proposal, 36 months long, are therefore: to remove those substances up to 93%; re-use the acrylic textiles as raw material for other production cycles, also in combination with virgin fibres to reach 3,300 tons total of waste prevented from disposal; reduce the amount of landfill and incineration of acrylic textiles of at least 30% for the outdoor sector (awnings and furnishing).

However, the increasing use of fuel cell electrical vehicles is expected to lead to a quickly growing demand for Platinum Group Metals. PGM production is not only itself related to negative environmental impacts but also raises questions of long-term availability due to the limitation of reserves and Europeâ€™s economic dependence on the countries of the materialsâ€™ origin. Hence, it is of strategic importance that the transition to PGM-free catalysts is made as quickly as possible to ensure Europe's competitive position and to reduce market pressure on the use of scarce noble metals.
In that perspective, PEGASUS is exploring the removal of Pt and other critical raw materials and their replacement by non-critical elements enabling efficient and stable electro-catalysis for performing and durable PEMFCs. The overall aim of the project is to bring up the experimental proof of concept for novel catalysts with five underlying objectives supporting a full validation at single cell scale with a focus on the cathode side: 1) High performance, 2) durable and 3) low cost MEA using non-PGM catalysts-based cathode; 4) Robust test protocols for catalysts screening and 5) Understanding of degradation and prevention & mitigation strategies through a MEA design-driven approach.

SoFiA aims to initiate & consolidate a baseline of feasibility for soap film based AP technology and its future uses by establishing the essential proofs-of principle & foundational scientific underpinnings. We propose the concept of an economic artificial photosynthetic membrane in form of soap film with photo-catalytic functional surfaces, formed at the junction between dis-symmetric soap bubble pairs. Our technology is made scalable by the design concept of a dynamic stream of regenerative soap bubbles capable of handling large volumes of gas, continuously flowing through a light exposed conduit. SoFiA bridges three mutually exclusive disciplines of surfactant science, renewable energy and fundamental science of water at nanoscale, supported by micro-systems engineering, and by actively engaging artists who are working with large soap film installations. The high risk is countered by engaging pioneering scientists and globally leading young researchers in an interdisciplinary research plan. An External Advisory Board composed of program managers from large industry and EU policy experts will guide the research deliverable towards commercial exploitation. Our long-term vision is to decisively alter Europeâ€™s position in the world economic map as the leading green energy producer.

The generic methodology will be applied to bridges and wind turbines in relation to fatigue offering the opportunity to deal with complementary notions (such as old and new asset management, unique and similar structures, wind and traffic actions) while addressing 3  major challenges: 1/advanced modelling of concrete fatigue behaviour,  2/new non destructive testing methods for early aged damage detection and 3/probabilistic approach of structure reliability under fatigue. Benefit of cross-experience and inter-disciplinary synergies will create new knowledge. INFRASTAR proposes innovative solutions for civil infrastructure asset management so that young scientists will acquire a high employment profile in close dialogue between industry and academic partners.

Modern engineering methods, including probabilistic approaches, risk and reliability assessment tools, will take into account the effective structural behaviour of existing bridges and wind turbines by exploiting monitored data. Existing methods and current state-of -the art is based on excessive conservatism which produces high costs and hinders sustainability.
INFRASTAR will improve knowledge for optimising the design of new structures, for more realistic verification of structural safety and more accurate prediction of future lifetime of the existing structures. That is a challenge for a sustainable development because it reduces building material and energy consumption as well as CO2 production.

Within the global framework of optimal infrastructure asset management, INFRASTAR will result in a multi-disciplinary body of knowledge covering generic problems from the design stage process of the new civil infrastructures up to recycling after dismantlement.

603,817221,Ligninpolymers,Transformation of kraft lignin into a biodegradable biopolymer,"RenFuel, a Swedish SME which has developed a drop-in biofuel, Lignol, from kraft lignin, has now developed a process for transforming lignin into a biopolymer, Renol. Renol, a biodegradable biopolymer with strong material properties, represents an alternative to many plastics, such as polystyrene (PS), which are associated with serious environmental and health issues.

Growing concerns regarding the problem of plastic in our oceans is leading to legislation banning certain plastics and driving demand from brand owners for replacement products. Starch based bioplastics, already available in the market, are limited in terms of applications as they are not water resistant. Renol, in contrast, can be used in a wide range of applications and in fact offers superior material qualities to some fossil-based polymers (e.g. mechanical strength, UV stability and fire-resistance). It is suitable for use in products which must be durable while in use, but, unlike most plastic, it will degrade (in a compostable environment) when no longer needed.

Kraft lignin is a waste product of kraft pulping (widely used for the manufacture of pulp and paper). RenFuel's solution offers to add value to lignin waste - thus representing a circular solution to the plastics pollution problem.  Lignin raw material is widely available in the pulp industry, in sufficient volumes to hypothetically replace a significant percentage of the fossil fuels used in the global plastics market.

RenFuel's business model involves the sale of Renol in pellet form to compounders, for mixing with existing (fossil-based) polymers to manufacture an end plastic product with a percentage of biodegrability - and potentially also add other valuable properties.

In the Phase I project, RenFuel will identify high value niche markets for biopolymer pellets, to enter initially into low volume processing (several thousand tons).

605,678941,SINCAT,Single Nanoparticle Catalysis,"Imagine a sustainable society where clean energy is produced from sunlight, and water is converted into hydrogen to fuel a fuel cell, which produces electric energy to power the electric motor in a car. At the same time, CO2 emissions are captured and converted to hydrocarbons that are again used as fuel or as resource for fine chemical synthesis. At the heart of this vision is heterogeneous catalysis. Hence, for it to become reality, tailored highly efficient catalyst materials are of paramount importance. The goal of this research program is therefore to establish a new experimental paradigm, which allows the detailed scrutiny of individual catalyst nanoparticles and their reaction products under application conditions.
The catalytic performance of nanoparticles is directly controlled by their size, shape and chemical composition. Current studies are, however, conducted on ensembles of nanoparticles. Therefore, such studies are plagued by averaging effects, which deny access to the key details related to how size, shape and composition control catalyst performance. To eliminate this problem, we will nanofabricate a unique nanofluidic reactor device that will enable us to scrutinize catalytic processes and products at the individual catalyst nanoparticle level. In a second step, we will integrate plasmonic optical probes with the nanoreactor to be able to simultaneously monitor the dynamics of the catalyst particle state during reaction.
Finally, we will apply the nanoreactor to investigate the role of the catalyst oxidation state in Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. In parallel, we will explore novel plasmon-induced hot electron-mediated reaction pathways for catalytic CO2 reduction, as part of a carbon-neutral energy cycle. We anticipate unprecedented insight into the role of catalyst particle state, size and shape in these processes. This will facilitate the development of more efficient catalyst materials in the quest for an energy-efficient and sustainable future.",2016-01-01,2020-12-31,1500000.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,4

As molecular systems we focus on bistable magnetic molecules able to switch between two spin states upon the application of an external stimulus (temperature, light, pressure, electric field etc.). As 2D materials we concentrate on those exhibiting in particular superconductivity or magnetism. The driving idea is to tune/improve the properties of the â€œall surfaceâ€ 2D material via an active control of the hybrid interface. This concept, which goes much beyond the conventional chemical functionalization of a 2D material, will provide an entire new class of smart molecular/2D heterostructures, which may be at the origin of a novel generation of hybrid materials and devices of direct application in highly topical fields like electronics, spintronics, molecular sensing and energy storage. Through this molecular approach, we will address major challenges in different areas of the 2D research: i) in 2D physics, we investigate the new properties that should appear in heterostructures involving 2D superconductors and 2D magnets or magnetic molecules; ii) in 2D electronics, we explore the possibility of tuning the superconducting/magnetic properties of a 2D material by applying an external stimulus (light for example), or to design smart electronic/spintronic devices able to respond to physical (light, magnetic field, etc.) or chemical stimuli (trapping of molecules); iii) in 2D composite materials, a general goal is to design hybrid molecular/2D materials with improved properties with respect to the pure 2D material to be used in the fabrication of energy storage devices.

Refractory angina is a substantial burden on the individual and healthcare system, in Europe there are 100,000 new cases per year, annual mortality of these patients is relatively low (<4%) thus refractory angina patients suffer multiple hospitalizations and low levels of health-related quality of life.

The ReGenHeart project is based on extensive preclinical work and a phase I safety, feasibility and dose-finding clinical study recently completed by the consortium. The project will conduct a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase II clinical study to provide proof of concept and clinical validation for a new, percutaneous, cost-efficient therapy for refractory angina patients. Using our optimized catheter-mediated intramyocardial approach with AdenoVEGF-D, which has never been used in man before our phase I trial, we aim to induce regenerative changes supported by therapeutic angiogenesis in the affected area of a patient's heart and, in a single procedure, reduce the burden on the individual and their health service. 

The proposed trial is ready to proceed, subject to final regulatory approval in the six European clinical centres. 180 CCS class 2-3 refractory angina patients will be recruited, which will allow us to assess the benefits of therapy to patients who still have potential to respond to the regenerative therapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either the gene therapy or placebo arms.

increase by a factor of up to 10 to make them commercially viable. Degradation of the fuel electrode (anode) is well
documented and fairly well understood; degradation at the oxygen electrode (cathode) has only recently attracted more
scientific research and is far less understood.
The purpose of this Fellowship is to better understand the degradation that takes place at the Yttria-Stabilised Zirconia (YSZ)
electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2Mn03 (LSM) cathode interface, as this has been cited as â€˜one of the most serious degradation
problems in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs)â€™. A new degradation mechanism involving YSZ has very recently been identified
at the host institution and its investigation forms the basis of this application. Assuming that a solution to this degradation can
be proposed, the project will have major impacts on the SOFC community and commercial SOFC development. The Fellow,
Dr Vendrell, will be supervised by a multi-disciplinary team of experienced researchers, who between them can guide and
tutor him in areas relevant to this project: ie materials synthesis and fabrication; electrical property measurements;
microstructural characterisation; fabrication of YSZ films using tape casting technology; spectroscopic characterisation and

Water electrolysis is a promising option for hydrogen production from renewable energy resources. Recently, a novel approach combining RED and Alkaline Polymer Electrolyte Water Electrolysis (APEWE) was reported for sustainable hydrogen production. However, this process achieved low efficiency: RED suffers from the negative impact of multivalent ions on power generation, whereas APEWE lacks highly conducive and stable membrane separators and polymer binders. The MARVEL project aims to i) endow monovalent ion selectivity for RED membranes to reduce the influence of multivalent ions ii) develop novel, fully characterized membrane separators and polymer binders for APEWE iii) test RED-APEWE process with these new materials iv) perform a techno-economic assessment for commercial feasibility.

The capital costs represents 78% of CoE and can be broken down into several categories, with around 54% attributable to wind turbine, from which the blades represents 30%.

CoE can be reduced by maximizing energy production for the site by installing larger turbines. However, as the length of current rotor blades increase, their associated cost and weight increase at a faster rate than the turbineâ€™s power output. Furthermore, as blades get longer they are becoming increasingly more difficult to manufacture and transport setting the limit at 90m.

Winfoor (WF) and Marstrom (MC) aim to pursue this market opportunity by bringing to market its innovative and ground-breaking blade technology â€“ Triblade. Triblade is a â€œ3-in-1â€ modular blade, built as a Composite Material Truss that will allow rotor blades to be longer (up to 50%), stiffer (up to 290%) and lighter (up to 78%), whilst reducing around 65.2% production costs and increasing ease of transport and installation resulting in up to 15.5% CoE reduction. These are game changing improvements that can play an important role in driving the development of next generation of larger turbines and accelerate the transition to greater use of renewables worldwide. 

TRIBLADE project is expected to significantly enhance WF&MCâ€™s profitability, with expected accumulated revenue of â‚¬85M and profits of â‚¬40M, 6 years after commercialization.

At Nowave Engineering Solutions S.L. we have developed an advanced multi-turbine system capable of efficiently capturing wave energy to produce electricity: ARRECIFE. While state-of-the-art WEC systems have reached a maximum capacity factor of 25%, Arrecife has already proven a capacity factor of 55%. This high performance is achieved thanks to the optimized design of Arrecife, which allows to capture both the horizontal (kinetic) and vertical (potential) energy components of the wave. Moreover, while most WEC systems are designed to work with waves of 6-8m, Arrecife is designed to work optimally with wave heights of 1-5 m, which constitute 85% of the available resource globally. Besides low capacity factors, other WEC systems are not competitive in our demanding energy market because of their high capital and operating costs, which results in LCOE of up to 110 â‚¬/MWh. Arrecife has a simple design, composed of commercially available materials, that reduces capital and operating cost and provides a LCOE of 46 â‚¬/MWh. Arrecife also incorporates a unique immersion mechanism, ensuring survivability during storms or under adverse sea conditions, increasing the lifetime of the system to over 20 years.

ii) linewidth narrowing in plasmonic nanoparticle films that enhances the lifetime of hot carriers and, thus, boosts the efficiency of light driven carrier extraction.
Instead of metals, which operate mostly in the visible region, we will make use of doped semiconductor nanocrystals (DSNCs) as hot electron extraction materials possessing a plasmonic response tunable in the range 800 nm â€“ 4000 nm. Three different innovative architectures will be used for improved device performance: i) improved Schottky junctions (DSNC/wide band gap semiconductor nanocomposites); ii) ultrathin devices (DSNCs/2D quantum materials); iii) maximized interface DSNC/semiconductor bulk hetero-Schottky junctions.
By combining both concepts in advanced architectures we aim to produce a solar cell device that functions in the NIR with efficiencies of up to 10%. A tandem solar cell that combines the conventional power conversion efficiency, up to ~1100 nm, of a commercial Si solar cell (~20%) with the new PAIDEIA based device is expected to reach a total power conversion efficiency of 30% by extending the width of wavelengths that are converted to the full spectral range delivered by the Sun. PAIDEIA has a deeply fundamental character impacting several areas in the field of nanophysics, nanochemistry and materials processing and, at the same time, having a high impact on the study of solar energy conversion. Finally, PAIDEIA will provide answers to the fundamental questions regarding the physical behaviour of plasmonic/semiconductor interfaces.",2019-04-01,2024-03-31,1815445.0,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,4
622,771793,3D-CAP,3D micro-supercapacitors for embedded electronics,"The realization of high-performance micro-supercapacitors is currently a big challenge but the ineluctable applications requiring such miniaturized energy storage devices are continuously emerging, from wearable electronic gadgets to wireless sensor networks. Although they store less energy than micro-batteries, micro-supercapacitors can be charged and discharged very rapidly and exhibit a quasi-unlimited lifetime. The global scientific research is consequently largely focused on the improvement of their capacitance and energetic performances. However, to date, they are still far from being able to power sensors or electronic components.
Here I propose a 3D paradigm shift of micro-supercapacitor design to ensure increased energy storage capacities. Hydrous ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a pseudocapacitive material for supercapacitor electrode well-known for its high capacitance. A thin-film of ruthenium will be deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), followed by an electrochemical oxidation process, onto a high-surface-area 3D current collector prepared via an ingenious dynamic template built with hydrogen bubbles. The structural features of these 3D architectures will be controllably tailored by the processing methodologies. These electrodes will be combined with an innovative electrolyte in solid form (a protic ionogel) able to operate over an extended cell voltage. In a parallel investigation, we will develop a fundamental understanding of electrochemical reactions occurring at the nanoscale with a FIB-patterned (Focused Ion Beam) RuO2 nano-supercapacitor. The resulting 3D micro-supercapacitors should display extremely high power, long lifetime and â€“ for the first time â€“ energy densities competing or even exceeding that of micro-batteries. As a key achievement, prototypes will be designed using a new concept based on a self-adaptative micro-supercapacitors matrix, which arranges itself according to the global amount of energy stored.",2018-04-01,2023-03-31,1673438.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,4
623,758149,reFUEL,Going global? Renewable fuel trade and social land-use restrictions in a low-carbon energy system,"Recent global integrated modelling studies indicate low intensities in trade of energy commodities between global regions in a future low-carbon global energy system. Also, research based on modelling indicates that deep greenhouse-gas emission cuts are possible in fully electrified renewable energy systems on a continental or country scale from a techno-economic perspective.
However, these modelling efforts partly neglect drivers of globalization and may therefore wrongly project regionalization of energy systems. In particular, (i) new, easily tradable, low-cost renewable fuels (e.g. solar & electric fuels), (ii) global bio-physical variability of renewables (e.g. solar radiation and freshwater availability), and (iii) regional differences in social land-use restrictions associated with the expansion of energy infrastructure can cause an increase of trade flows in the energy sector.
We aim at better understanding how the spatial configuration of renewables in low-carbon energy systems is affected by these drivers and develop a cutting-edge, open-source global renewable energy model that combines elements of energy system and land-use modelling. It takes into account bio-physical conditions for renewable fuel and electricity production, social land availability restrictions, and a map of existing energy infrastructure at unprecedented level of detail. Our approach integrates open data sources from public institutions, user-generated GIS data, and social networks. Existing models for Europe and Brazil are used for validation. Qualitative interviews in local case studies complement the global model and increase our understanding of land-use restrictions on the local scale. 
Our project has impacts beyond energy systems analysis: in particular the identification of winning and losing regions in a global renewable energy system is highly relevant in climate change mitigation negotiations, and the generated spatial indicators and maps enable many potential applications.",2018-08-01,2023-07-31,1499905.0,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,4

The project is founded and focused on two main points: degradation mechanisms understanding and durability prediction improvement via the development and validation of specific ASTs and associated transfer functions. 
Degradation investigations will be based on consolidated data (objects with known history and ageing data) from both real systems tested in cars and ID-FAST test program to ensure relevant analysis of failure modes and performance losses together with a mean to validate the developed methodology. Investigation of stressors impact on components degradation and performance losses will give access to the accelerating factor for each single mechanism AST.
Thanks to the expertise of partners, understanding will be ensured by advanced ex-situ and in-situ characterisations to identify and quantify components degradation phenomena, and by modelling and multi-scale simulation tools to investigate the impact of various stressors and to relate causes to  performance losses.
Combined AST protocols will be developed and validated with regard to their capability to actually reduce testing time and their relevance assessed by correlation to real world ageing. The methodology developed will allow prediction of stack lifetime and thus will be valuable for the whole automotive fuel cell community.
To achieve its objectives, ID-FAST will benefit from the strong expertise of 8 partners (4 research centres, 1 university, 1 SME and 2 large companies) all along the value chain, and from an Advisory Group gathering industrial companies from components manufacturers to end-users, as well as recognised laboratories from USA and Japan.",2018-01-01,2020-12-31,2748195.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,4

This is no longer true since 2013, where our group had demonstrated that Li-driven reversible formation of (O2)n peroxo-groups in new layered oxides led to extraordinary increases in energy storage capacity. To fully exploit this discovery we were granted in 2015 an advanced ERC grant entitled 'Anionic redox processes: A transformational approach for advanced energy materials (ARPEMA)', the goal being to rationalize the fundamental science underpinning this new concept. This calls for new paradigms in characterization techniques to fully track among others the stability of these new compounds as well as the side reactions that they could generate at both electrodes during cycling together with their transport and kinetic properties. To address this critical need we developed a new design test system which enables for monitoring potential, current, temperature, pressure as well as the nature and composition of the released gases together with the impedance built-up at each electrode. Owing to the relative simplicity, high versatility and great reliability of such a new-patented multi-function testing device we anticipate its rapid implementation to various battery technologies. The goal of this project is to develop a proof of concept prototype and a small series production, as well as performing an extensive market analysis and budgeting suppliers, all for establishing an accurate business proposition.

627,751843,POWERSHIFTS,Shifting political power: the nature and consequences of distributed renewable energy transitions,"Global energy transitions are progressing rapidly. Over half of new generation capacity in 2014 came from renewable energy. Individual, community and co-operative decentralized renewable energy (DRE) producers are capturing a growing share of energy markets (e.g. solar, wind, biomass). As their market share increases, DRE producers are becoming increasingly effective political actors. The traditional political privilege enjoyed by incumbent industries is challenged by these DRE actors as they shift control over jobs, economic growth and energy supplies. Political struggles between competing interests are increasing. However, the nature and extent of these power shifts (e.g. changes in access to policy makers, media influence), and their consequences for political systems and their outcomes (e.g. contested carbon targets, renewable energy subsidies) are poorly understood. This project addresses how and why DRE transitions are shifting political power relations, and the consequences of those shifts for political systems and outcomes. Using an interdisciplinary approach grounded in theory on sustainability transitions (i.e. Multi-Level Perspective), power (e.g. Lukes, Foucault) and institutions (i.e. institutional logics) the project will: (1) examine the conditions leading to shifts in political power by analyzing existing political power relations in regimes where DRE transitions are expected, occurring, or stalled; (2) assess the mechanisms by which political power shifts resulting from these DRE transitions are occurring; and, (3) identify the consequences of DRE-related political power shifts for political systems and their outcomes. Objectives will be explored using a global survey of 20 DRE regimes. Survey insights will be expanded in 5 international comparative cases. Findings will address urgent questions highlighted by academics, the EU, and global economic bodies about the political, economic and social impacts of the changing energy landscape.",2017-09-01,2019-08-31,165598.8,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,4

PHA is the only bioplastic which is 100% degradable in natural environment but is presently only applied in niche applications due the high costs of production. POLÃ¬PO's chemical route to PHA represents a game changing technology in the field of bioplastic, making it possible to produce a biodegradable bioplastic with key advantages with respect to current fermentative route: reduction of production cost > 35 %; reduction of investment for production plant of around 70-80%; reduction of plant size of around 50%; use of non-food raw materials.
The unique selling point is then to enable production of 100% biodegradable PHAs from different non-food oil sources in a competitive manner for large scale applications (e.g. food packaging) which are presently not allowed by the high price of PHAs. This will allow as first step to substitute bio-based PET in this segment, worth 800 kt/year in 2016, and successively targeting substitution of fossil based plastics. 
After validation at pre-industrial scale, POLÃ¬POâ€™s process will be licensed to existing and new industrial players in the bioplastic manufacturing sector, in the form of License Agreement or Joint Venture. In the feasibility study POLÃ¬PO needs to 1) carry out Customer Validation for the technology, 2) Define the industrial upstream and downstream value chain and profiling industrial partners and investors 3) Refine the Business Plan the Business Model and the Investment strategy.",2018-06-01,2018-11-30,50000.0,,['bioplastic'],1,4

We have developed an innovative technology able to recover the secondary fractions of PET recycling, 15 % of the recycled product, which up to now have been no recyclable and send to incineration or landfill. We have designed a multilayered R-PET sheet structure, HORTAPPET, having the outer layers made with a co-polyester with a glass transition greater than 95 ÂºC, and a central layer of R-PET (secondary fractions) thermoplastic material. HORTAPPET achieves a heat resistance up to 80 ÂºC, a reduction in its fragility, a notable transparence, and a lack of contaminants, what helps it to be 100% recyclable itself. Our product will be commercialized at a price 20% cheaper than other conventional solutions. This new business opportunity is expected to reach about 7,5 MLN â‚¬ after 5 years of commercialization. The payback of the expected investment of this project, 1,2 MLN â‚¬, will be reached during the 3rd year. This innovative product is aimed to be sold in the horticultural market, and final users are mainly growers and greenhouse managers. Our main commercial barrier will be to gain presence in the international horticultural market as this is a new sector for us. In order to overcome this barrier, promotional activities will be essential. Our project is in line with the circular economy as it promotes the efficient use and recycling of the off grade fractions of R-PET promoting the development of new market applications. HORTAPPET is the best option for horticultural applications because it has better mechanical and visual properties than R-PS and R-PP. Besides, it is cheaper due to the fact that it is made of discharged fractions of PET recycling process.

MDS Meyer GmbH is a technology-based company with extended expertise and experience in the field of technical rubber products. With DBU funding support, we have developed to TRL 6 a new secondary raw material based on an innovative, solvent-free recycling process of reactivating post-industrial vulcanized EPDM scrap material with several liquid EPDM polymers that enables significant levels of re-usage in high-quality new products in the fields of rubber gaskets, automotive industries and other technical rubber products. 
The recycled compound ensures the complete recycling of vulcanized EPDM waste, allowing for the substitution of up to 80% of virgin EPDM rubber, without decreasing the quality of the new products. Our solution exhibits the advantage of providing a safe and inexpensive secondary raw material basis, while reducing European Union companiesâ€™ dependency on imports of raw materials.

632,696556,FishDirector,Automatic Scalable VM Management for Data Centre Optimisation,"The overall vision of the FishDirector project is to bring to market our innovative software solution for real time live optimization of cloud data centres to enable optimum use of server resources and reduce overall energy use by at least 30%. 

To reduce the number of servers needed to deliver services and reduce overall energy consumption data centres have adopted virtualization, running VMs (virtual machines) on each server. VM workload is dynamic, varying in response to user demand. However, data centre operators do not currently have a comprehensive automated system for optimally placing VMs and allocating the optimal number of servers to meet the workload requirements. This results in sub-optimal hardware utilization (typically 18% whilst consuming 60% - 90% of their maximum system power), a larger number of servers than is necessary, higher energy consumption and a poorer end user experience due to lower response time and/or intermittent availability. 

FishDirector works with OpenStack to address this problem by providing a scalable software solution for automating VM placement in a highly dynamic environment and consolidating live VMs data centre-wide, ensuring continuous operation and load balancing. Unlike existing solutions, it allows data centre operators to automatically optimize resources for VM instances across multiple servers in a scalable manner and with no practical limit to the number of servers that can be managed.

FishDirector has been successfully demonstrated in small server installations and is thus at TRL6. We seek funding for the Phase I Feasibility Study to explore the viability of moving FishDirector to TRL 9 through a Phase 2 project to demonstrate and validate FishDirector in a large data centre (> 100 servers).

There are PV panels, PV mounting systems, heatable insulated glass units, radiators. The main innovative feature of our technology is a cost-effective integration of properties of all these products. Thanks to 3rd generation solar cells application, higher aesthetic, transparency and better power reduction parameter in relation to any PV technology used so far on Building-Integrated PV sector could be achieved.
We intend to contribute to solving one of the Europeanâ€™s main problem, as well as one of the real estateâ€™s market problems. Buildings are the biggest primary energy consumer and Europeâ€™s CO2 emitter. 30% of energy consumed in buildings is used unnecessarily or inefficiently. 30-50% of energy loss is attributed to air leakage and heat transfer. One of the main sources of these losses are windows.

Based on the current market trends the total market volume and waste generation will increase more than 5-times by 2022, causing a huge environmental impact.

Despite the growing popularity and implementation of artificial grass fields, there are no unified regulations or procedures for its EOL management. Current recycling technologies enable only low-efficiency infill separation from the artificial grass that is also time consuming, expensive and unsustainable. Therefore, most field owners landfill the used turf without any recycling, creating a big environmental impact and increasing the need for raw materials in new installations.

ASIE, company with over 20-years of experience in installing artificial grass fields, has developed the first mobile and complete artificial grass recycling line that helps to lower the synthetic turf EOL management costs by up to 40-50% and increase the artificial grass sustainable management recycling rates. Compared to alternative solutions, we ensure:
â€¢ 2x better infill separation (100%)
â€¢ 4x faster old turf removal (1 day)
â€¢ 2x faster field renewal (7 days)
â€¢ 30-40% cheaper field renewal

Using molten zinc has a number of advantages over traditional processes:

Economic process as:
Speed of tyre destruction is just 30 minutes rather than 2-4 hours as in traditional rotary kiln processes.  
No shredding / granulating; whole tyres, savings in capital and operational costs.  
No scale-up issues: doubling the surface area of the molten material doubles the throughput.  
Separation: the molten zinc is used to separate the steel and carbon black.  

Every year over 1.5 billion tyres are discarded worldwide.  Tyres are a composite plastic material and difficult to recycle, but they do contain value in their constituent raw materials such as oil, carbon black, copper and steel.  

Because the process utilises existing, proven technologies from low cost industries such as the hot dip galvanising and the carbon black manufacturing industry the technological and hence commercial risk is minimised.  

The tyre recycling process was proven to work as intended in collaboration with University College Cork.  The next step is to construct a demonstration plant and to proof the recycling of the tyres on this scale providing customers with the confidence of investing into full scale plants.  

For all the above waste streams the European and US legislators are increasing the pressure on industry to develop a solution, presenting an opportunity.

The work proposed in the NanoDome project addresses the aforementioned challenges by delivering a modelling and analysis tool for the detailed prediction of complex nanomaterial structures formation in a single-step and industrially scalable GP synthesis process, in order to optimize existing processes, shorten the development of new processes and increase the production rates.",2015-09-15,2018-09-14,3999110.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,4
640,778039,PEARLS,PLANNING AND ENGAGEMENT ARENAS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY LANDSCAPES,"As an active key actor in the spatial planning and social innovation arena for Renewable Energy Landscapes REL, the PEARLS project will reinforce the populationâ€™s commitment to secure, clean and efficient energy. REL are regarded as spaces where renewable energies change the populationâ€™s relationship with energy and their landscape perception. Despite all efforts, resistance to REL lingers in Europe/the U.S., while the reasons for strong social acceptance in Mediterranean and South American countries is still unknown. Thus PEARLS will focus on Southern Europe and Israel due to their wealth of renewable energy resources and citizensâ€™ deep engagement with REL. 

PEARLS will radically transform scientific knowledge on how to best implement REL across Europe and extend southern landscapes towards other Mediterranean countries through participant networks. PEARLS will generate a step change in the way that REL are theorised, detected and addressed and provide crucial support for the Pan-European Energy Challenge by establishing international, intersectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration as the nexus of a five-country holistic pool of universities and research centres in close cooperation with non-academic sectors. All Partnership members, from five universities and nine non-academic beneficiaries (companies, private consultancies, cooperatives and business associations) have proven expertise and experience in working with renewable energy, energy policy, REL, spatial planning and social innovation, through the internationalisation of applied research and training for capacity development. Via secondments, staff exchange and collaborative inquiry, the project will investigate how to enforce renewable energy best practice to contribute to the Energy Challenge. Deliverables will be provided by working reports, websites, video channels, toolkits, training and methodology materials, seminars, and scientific papers, academic journals and books.",2018-07-01,2022-06-30,405000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,4
641,652862,IMPRECSIM,Improving wet plastic recycling through innovative lagrangian particle-fluid simulations,"Wet particle separation is used widely in mineral processing as well as plastic recycling to separate mixtures of particulate materials into further usable fractions due to density differences. Despite its wide usage wet particle separation processes are often attributed to operational problems especially if density differences of the feed material are low. A review of the state of the art clearly indicates that numerical modelling has not yet been applied to wet separation processes due to the lack of applicable numerical schemes. On this background numerical modelling can strongly contribute towards improving the design and process parameters of wet particle separation technologies especially in the field of plastic recycling - improvements have a strong environmental impact such as reduced landfill and lower overall pollution.

The proposed research consists of two parts. The first objective is the development of a novel, fully Lagrangian particle-fluid modelling framework applicable to systems of particles of complex shape in a wet environment. For modelling the particles, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) will be employed. For the fluid part, the Lagrangian Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) will be used which enables handling free surfaces and large movements of the fluid, inherently. While unresolved fluid flow around particles is already used in mesh based methods, coupling the DEM and SPH in one computational framework is a challenging task addressed in this project. Thereby, a framework is developed for representing technical scale systems of complex shaped particles in a wet environment for the first time. In the second part of the project, the developed framework will be applied to the modelling of a wet separation process involving a sink-float drum separator for plastic recycling. Both design and operational parameters will be optimized and results exchanged towards technology improvements with interested European companies from the recycling sector.",2015-06-01,2016-11-30,128595.6,,['recycling'],1,4
642,787011,SPEAR,SPEAR: Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid,"Over the last decade, cyber-attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, stealthy, targeted and multi-faceted which may leverage zero-day exploits and highly creative interdisciplinary attack methods. As our society is becoming increasingly dependent on Critical INfrastructures (CIN), new technologies are needed to increase our detection and response capabilities. Detecting and responding to such attacks by a highly motivated, skilled and well-funded attacker has however been proven highly challenging. One of the most vulnerable and high-impact CIN is the Smart Grid. Smart Grid is considered as the next-generation power system, which promises self-healing, resilience, sustainability and efficiency to the energy Critical Infrastructures (CIN). However, securing smart grids against cyber-attacks is of vital importance for National Security and Public Safety, since the collapse of an energy production utility may cause human lives, millions of euros, denial of a very important and common good such as energy and days or even months of recovering. To this end, the SPEAR proposal aims at a) detecting and responding to cyber-attacks using new technologies and capabilities, b) detecting threat and anomalies timely, c) developing all-in-one security detection solutions, d) leveraging advanced forensics subject to privacy-preserving, e) confronting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and targeted attacks in smart grids, f) increasing the resilience of the smart grid innovation, g) alleviating the lack of trust in smart grid operators and h) empowering EU-wide consensus.

Access to raw materials and resource efficiency are at the forefront of the EU political debate and recycling is a main part of the solution of many strategic objectives. It addresses resource scarcity and enhances security of material supply, while contributing to higher energy efficiency and lower environmental impacts. Moreover, recycling offers significant investment, innovation and employment opportunities in the EU. In this context, this RISE programme aims to promote international and inter-sector collaboration through research and innovation staff exchanges, share knowledge and ideas from research to market (and vice-versa) for the advancement of science and the development of innovation within the recycling and valorization of mining and quarrying wastes which represent 27% of the EU total waste generated from economic activities and households, promote utilization of innovative geopolymeric materials in the construction sector, and foster a shared culture of research and innovation that welcomes and rewards creativity and entrepreneurship and helps turn creative ideas into innovative products, services or processes in the materials industry through recycling mining wastes, by taking advantage of the integrated knowledge acquired in the complementary areas of the RISE partners.

In the past 3 years, the team at WIMAO has put our careers in recycling to use by developing REMAT: a patented technology to turn non-recyclable mixed plastic waste streams and other non-recycled materials into composite products. Our products have the full consistency and the same physical properties as composites produced with virgin raw materials. Beyond that, the end products we manufacture are recyclable at the end of their life cycle creating an infinite loop.
We have set up a pilot REMAT facility that started production in January 2019. We are turning mixed plastic waste that is not wanted by the plastic recycling industry and wood waste into, composite products.
The total available raw material (waste streams) for our products is calculated in billions of tons, giving us a nearly unlimited growth potential. If the capacity of our REMAT plants were to match this potential supply, we could ideally replace all composite products on the market with our recycled composite raw material.
WIMAO is uniquely positioned to create a new standard operating mode for the recycling industry. Our breakthrough has been creating high-value materials from many mixed inputs, effectively surmounting the key barrier for recycling: the need to separate waste streams. We have the only technology versatile enough to handle the volumes of waste that Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) collect, exactly as they receive it.

646,726618,ARENA,The first on-site mobile solution for complete synthetic grass recycling and materials reuse,"Boom in synthetic grass sporting fields in EU and USA in the last 15-years has led to huge environmental problem. 600 000 tonnes of rubber, sand and plastics mixed wastes are generated from used fields each year in EU alone. Based on the current market trends, the total wastes will increase by 5-times by 2030, leading to over 3 million tonnes of mixed wastes annually.

Despite the growing popularity of synthetic grass both in major football leagues and school grounds, there are no unified regulations or effective technologies for its sustainable EOL management. Current solutions enable only limited used grass recycling and materials reclaim and thus field owners currently landfill 90% of the used grass without any recycling.

ASIE, company with over 20-years of experience in synthetic grass fields, has developed the first on-site recycling solution that enables complete used synthetic grass recycling and materials reuse for environmental and economic sustainability. Compared to alternatives, we ensure:

â€¢ Used grass and infill high-quality re-installation 
â€¢ 100% infill reclaim, separation, cleaning and sanitary treatment
â€¢ 4x faster old turf removal and 2x faster full field renewal
â€¢ 50% cost reduction of old field utilization and 50% savings from new installation

We aim to achieve a zero-waste concept and improve the environmental sustainability of synthetic grass installations. Our unique ARENA concept enables to eliminate current landfilling and reuse 100% of the materials in new fields or as recycled raw materials in other industries. As a result, we:

â€¢ Prevent 1 million tonnes of mixed wastes from landfilling annually
â€¢ Reduce field renewal transportation need by 10-times, leading to 95% less CO2 emissions

Our total targeted market in Europe is â‚¬350m annually, with very high growth potential in the next years. As a result of the innovation project, we will generate â‚¬125m total sales revenue and create 350 new jobs by 2023.",2016-07-01,2018-06-30,1619887.5,,['recycling'],1,4

- a strategic design of the whole value chain from textile waste collection, until the new marketable feedstock for chemical & textile industrie, by which the symbiosis opportunities are evaluated (by public authorities and the private sector) in terms of their social, technical, economic, environmental and legislative aspects
- the improvement of collection approaches particularly for non-wearable textiles for recycling by changing citizenâ€™s behaviour and creation of tools for higher social involvement and recycling promotion. This will ensure a greater accessibility to textile waste as resource and increase the textile waste rates destined for recycling. With 50% collection rate all over Europe would be a significant improvement in order to provide large quantities of feedstock
- a data aggregation system that will be developed and implemented in order to ensure waste traceability and also provide relevant data for economic and environmental assessment;
- the development of new business models adapted for different synergies identified and for new markets. In addition, environmental LCA and LCC for different scenarios and identification of the most promising routes and synergies will support this objective
- automation of the macro separation and sorting for pure or blended textiles, in order to enhance productivity and competitiveness of the whole recycling process

The increase in energy democracy and social equity will be an essential part of the clean energy transition.  A transition that could represent one of the most fundamental social, economic and technical changes in modern history.

The most common businesses associated with social innovation in the renewable energy sector are Cooperatives, Aggregators and Crowdfunding platforms.  These businesses facilitate consumers to take a more active role in the electricity system. Achieving sustained growth in energy democracy requires a better understanding of support structures for successful social innovation across technical, legal and economic systems. SocialRES aims to devise more effective ways of increasing social innovation leading to greater social acceptability as well as more durable governance arrangements and socioeconomic benefits.

Through research excellence and co-creation of knowledge with relevant stakeholders, SocialRES will develop socially innovative and inclusive strategies for the energy system of the future. SocialRES will supplement the existing fragmented data on social innovations with new understandings from businesses, end-users and stakeholders to provide a comprehensive evidence base for policy design.

WEEE plastics often contain undesired additives that hamper recycling in Europe. 75% of WEEE is currently exported to Asia where it is recycled to secondary plastics containing undesired (hazardous) substances or ending up in landfill where leaching occurs. Hence for WEEE plastics a closed loop solution is needed. 
PLAST2bCLEANEDâ€™s aim is to develop a recycling process for WEEE plastics in a technically feasible, environmentally sound and economically viable manner. To fulfil this aim, PLAST2bCLEANED addresses the recycling of the most common WEEE plastics acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) that contain up to 20wt% brominated flame retardants (BFR) and up to 5wt% of the synergist antimony trioxide (ATO). PLAST2bCLEANED will close three loops: (1) polymer, (2) bromine, and (3) ATO. 
Key technologies developed within the project are: (1) improved sorting of HIPS and ABS that contain BFR from other polystyrene and ABS fractions; (2) dissolution of WEEE plastics in superheated solvents; (3) separation of additives to concentrate BFR and ATO fractions for recycling; (4) energy efficient recovery of solvent and of polymer. The developed technology will be integrated in a pilot facility with capacity of 2 kg/hr (TRL 6) delivering polymer samples. The developed technology can be applied to similar waste streams from other sectors, e.g. automotive.  
The combination of improved sorting and use of superheated solvents offers an economic and environmental advantage. First calculations indicate a sound business case: ABS can be recovered with the superheated solvent dissolution process at a cost of 470 â‚¬/ton compared to 890 â‚¬/ton for the alternative process Creasolv.

The steep growth of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV) market, projected to reach respectively 25 million and 7.6 million units by 2025, is leading to an unparalleled increase of the Black Mass amount to be disposed (up to 4 million tons by 2025) with an unsustainable expense for the industrial players (100 â‚¬/ton). But the Black Mass is a potential source of Cobalt, a critical material for the battery manufacturing: today, more than 60% of the global Cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a steeply growing trend of its price due to political instability and market demand increase. Cobalt price is highly fluctuating, but it is foreseen to reach >100 â‚¬/kg from 2022, with an extra cost of 600 Mâ‚¬/year for EV industry. Recycling the Cobalt contained in the spent batteries would allow to mitigate the price and reduce the dependence of European companies on imports.
CoReco is an innovative and cost competitive process able to recover Cobalt, Nickel, Manganese and Copper contained in the Black Mass derived from the recycling of LIB with high purity. CoReco uses 2 innovative solutions: a Top Blown Rotary Converter for smelting, much more efficient and compact than competing solutions; a single reactor for all subsequent hydrometallurgical purification steps. CoReco is able to recover 98% of Ni, Co, Mn and Cu contained in the Black Mass and to reach > 99% purity of the Cobalt for reuse as secondary raw material for the LIB manufacturing. The compactness and low CAPEX of the plant makes CoReco the most competitive recycling solution on the market: the target Cost of Recovery (CoR) is < 1,200 â‚¬/ton (including CAPEX and OPEX), 30% less than competing solutions, making recycling industrially viable.",2019-06-01,2019-11-30,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,4
656,768264,serverChill,Server liquid cooling for  Data Centres... done right!,"'With the accelerating increase of cloud-based services, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data the IT sector is running into a fundamental bottleneck. Indeed, the demand for upscaling the computational power requires even denser server farms, whose thermal management of dissipated heat with conventional air-based cooling is both becoming technically unfeasible, environmentally questionable and economically unbearable. Thus, power/cooling is currently the #1 Data Centre (DC) design criteria.
Asetekâ€™s Direct-To-Chip liquid cooling solutions are based on the fact that water absorbs and conducts heat much more efficiently than air. This directly translates in computational performance gains, since the components can run at speed without overheating or undesired throttling thanks to efficient heat dissipation. Moreover, Asetekâ€™s data centre-oriented liquid cooling solution â€“ RackCDU D2Câ„¢, a disruptive server chassis with an integrated liquid piping that transfers heat from CPUs/GPUs and memory modules to flowing liquid through radiator interfaces â€“ can even enable the dissipated heat to be recovered for building heating, thus reducing the cooling energy bill of data centres up to 70%. In addition, these significant savings are delivered while requiring only a 6% CAPEX increase for new DCs and having a <1 year investment payback time â€“ thus providing a much stronger value proposition than direct competitors.
The key market barrier to generate strong pull for RackCDU in the $5bn market of Data Centre cooling technologies is the very conservative and risk-averse mind-set of data centre managers. Thus, the core activities of the project primarily focus on large scale showcasing of RackCDU, which will enable Asetek to thoroughly anchor its communication around a fact-based strategy . This will propel our SME growth over the next decade, posing a potential business revenue stream allowing to graduate from its SME status within the first 5-years post-project.

Despite the vast variety of semiconductor materials, solution processable semiconductor nanocrystals (NCâ€™s) take lead thanks to their excellent optoelectronic properties (tunable band-gap, high PLQY and optical stability) while they become more and more appealing for their low production cost. Although, a variety of semiconductor NCâ€™s have been synthesized for application in the visible spectral region, only few examples exist with tunability in mid and near-IR, and most notable high toxicity mercury and lead based NCs. On the other hand, nowadays we experience a burst of emerging near and mid-IR technologies (e.g. solar cells, detectors, night cameras) which are moving towards the use of environmentally friendly IR emitting materials for large scale production. Therefore, NAROBAND aims to exploit the synthesis and the functionalization of low-toxic narrow-band gap Ag2SxSey NCâ€™s via both chemical and physical routes towards the fabrication of environmental friendly, low cost solar cell devices. The project focus on achieving full control of the bandgap (1.2eVâ€“0.4eV) via quantum confinement and stoichiometry allowing to decouple nanocrystals size and surface effects from bandgap, leading to a better control of the optoelectronic properties.

658,798365,SABIR,Dynamic sustainability assessment tool for the case studies of biorefinery supply chains from agricultural wastes,"There is continuous refining and development of novel methodologies in the field of sustainability. From these methodologies, life cycle assessment is one of the most commonly used today. Over past decades researchers have â€œupgradedâ€ life cycle assessment to life cycle sustainability assessment; later method combines 3 pillars of sustainability: environment, society and economy. While current methodologies looks at the impacts of analysed product or service in more holistic way, this approach is still lacking one important issue â€“ dynamic feedback loops. The bottleneck of life cycle sustainability assessment method is rooted in the assumption that values for the impact categories remain constant, that is assuming a constant marginal impact or that no other sustainability information changes the overall system, and thus also the individual impacts. 

The aim of SABIR is to develop a novel, dynamic sustainability assessment tool, that uses life cycle sustainability assessment and system dynamic analysis tools at the same time in one model. To validate this tool two case studies of biorefinery supply chains from agricultural wastes will be used.

Biorefinery case studies are chosen because these systems are increasingly seen as pivotal technologies to strengthen the growth in the area of bio-economy. Nevertheless, the overall environmental, economic and social consequences of implementing such biorefinery systems are poorly understood. Therefore, this project will aim to give two major benefits (1) to advance life cycle sustainability assessment methodology by introduction of feedback loops, (2) to advance studies on biorefinery concept, by outlining possible impacts and solutions.",2018-06-01,2020-05-31,200194.8,,['biorefinery'],1,4

A number of wave energy researchers have observed the phenomenon and sought to dampen it, but the concept of harnessing the power transferred from (typically) heave to (typically) pitch/roll has not been considered. This fellowship aims to control the parametric resonance of WEC dynamics to improve energy conversion efficiency, based on a 1/20 scale prototype. The research objectives (ROs) are: RO1: Identify a high-fidelity and computation-effective model to represent the WEC parametric resonance with CFD verification in OpenFOAM (open source) and parametric analysis in MATLAB. RO2: Develop advanced nonlinear control strategies and corresponding PTO mechanism for actuation, to improve WEC efficiency making use of its multi-DoF motion and parametric resonance. RO3: Conduct tank testing to verify the modelling of parametric resonance (RO1), and model-based control design and implementation (RO2), based on a self-assembled 1/20 scale prototype. Successful achievement of this fellowship will lead to timely and useful contribution to the wave energy and relevant communities, including: (i) an hydrodynamic model describing WEC parametric resonance with real time computation capacity, (ii) advancing the understanding in WEC parametric resonance, (iii) a 1/20 scale WEC prototype, and (iv) implementable control  and PTO systems for multi-DoF WEC systems.

Relying on district heating systems for heat generation is the most effective solution in densely populated areas. However, many district heating systems (DHS) are highly energy inefficient and need to be modernized. Considering that the predominant energy sources used are still fossil fuels (oil, gas or coal) makes interventions ever more urgent. Both statements hold especially for East European countries where old, inefficient district heating systems, mostly fueled by fossil sources, urgently need to be modernized. 

The unique feature of KeepWarm is its combination of concrete work at pilot systems and its close alignment with national and European multipliers to disseminate this experience broadly. The latter incudes close interaction with potential investors and fund managers to increase the likelihood that KeepWarm business plans receive the necessary funding. The project promotes EU goals of improved and environmental friendly heating and cooling but adapts its exploitation strategy to distinct national windows of opportunities.

KeepWarm will work intensively with DHS in seven countries (i) to increase the energy efficiency of these systems; and (ii) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting a switch from fossil to renewable fuels. This is most urgently needed in the case of large-scale DH systems that are mostly found in Eastern Europe, the focus of this project. Likewise, it is important to ensure that existing DHS that run on renewables do not switch back to fossil fuels.",2018-04-01,2020-09-30,2098488.5,,['district heating'],1,4

This technology recycles PMMA to methyl methacrylate(MMA) monomer which in turn will be used for the production of PMMA sheets known as Acrylic or Plexiglas(TM).
A plant to second life is the first step towards an endless cycle. MMA is the only plastic that can be eternally reincarnated, but only under the perfect technique. Our proposal provides this perfect technique and thus, it promotes sustainability.
M-D2, a technopolis R&D company, developed a new pyrolysis technique for safe, cheap and eco-friendly recovery of MMA. P2L technology is not the only PMMA recycling technique, however it is the most eco-friendly, lowest power consuming one. Its product RMMA(regenerated MMA) has a purity more than 99%. These make P2L the future PMMA recycling technology for European Countries and many more developed countries complying the regulations.
Making an innovative technology investment with high profit and fast return in a low competition sector is the unique selling point of P2L.
PMMA is used in the production of TV screens, LEDâ€™s, automobile rear lights, aeroplane windows, mobile phone screens and many more in optical or surface/coating solutions. Wide usage(~3.36 M tons annually) of PMMA and the expects of 100% consumption increase in 15 years, results considerable waste production. PMMA wastes are collected and shipped to developing countries as China and India.
Today a global crisis is on the way after China decided in 2017 to stop importing waste plastics. China started this waste ban in 01.01.2018. Conventional PMMA recycling techniques are restricted by regulations in the developed countries so it is a shocking threat stopping to export their waste PMMA.

Without such a solution, it would be impossible for the EU to transition to large scale renewable energy deployments and guarantee a stable and decentralized electricity grid. 
At Infinite Fingers GmbH, we identified the potential of this unexploited market niche, and came up with a unique solution, U-Control: an innovative control and management solution for Hybrid Power Systems (HPS) which is able to integrate all components.

Multi-temporal analysis of wood formation in conifers,"Forest carbon sequestration plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. As evidenced by recent studies, tree carbon uptake is directly controlled by environmental influence on wood (xylem) formation processes. Current knowledge on how and when climate influences these processes mostly come from short-term direct (weekly xylogenesis monitoring) and long-term indirect (width and anatomy of annual tree rings) analysis of tree growth. Nevertheless these approaches, related to different scales of investigation, cannot provide a complete overview of the complex climate influence on tree carbon sequestration, when used separately. 
INTREE aims at quantitatively assess multi-temporal climate influence on tree carbon sequestration in temperate and boreal forests. The project will focus on two conifer species, Picea abies and Picea mariana, along two elevation gradients in the Alps and one latitude gradient in Canada. A novel approach, the analysis of intra-ring wood anatomy along tree-ring series, will be used to create a link between different scales of investigation. Xylogenesis monitoring, tree ring analysis, and intra-ring quantitative wood anatomy, will be innovatively used jointly to assess intra-seasonal to multi-decadal climate variation influence on xylem formation processes. This new knowledge will be used to quantify climate influence on xylem cell number, size, and wall thickness in tree rings, and therefore to assess how climate variations affect the amount of carbon annually stock in the tree stem.
INTREE will promote the integration of different expertizes, methods and scales of investigation in climate change-related research. Outcomes will provide a unique contribution to current understanding of forest carbon sequestration, and provide mechanistic information for vegetation and carbon process-based models.

However, enormous challenges exist to process biopolymers, to disperse nanoparticles in biopolymer matrices, and to achieve desired properties. This research specifically focuses on creating low-cost green biopolymer-graphene nanocomposites with tailored structure and properties via an innovative highly-efficient continuous engineering process. The core objective is to understand the fundamental physicochemical and rheological interactions between biopolymers and graphene with the smart use of novel additives/plasticisers, for precisely controlling composite structural evolution during melt processing. Initially, this will rely on the design of graphene and additives/plasticisers for the biopolymers, and then melt processing and plasticisation of biopolymer-based materials to realise specially oriented distribution of graphene on the nanoscale. Consequently, the interrelationships between processing conditions (affecting the interactions) and material properties (e.g. mechanical, electroconductivity) will be established. The understanding from this project is critical to engineering various biopolymer materials with tailored structures and properties for high-value application areas (e.g. biomedical, environmental).

Although the efficiencies of perovskite devices are rising fast, both PV and LEDs fall short of out-performing current technology and reaching their theoretical performance limits. To achieve their full potential, parasitic non-radiative losses and bandgap instabilities from ionic segregation must be fundamentally understood and eliminated. HYPERION will address these issues by i) elucidating the origins of non-radiative decay and ion segregation in films and devices, ii) devising means to eliminate these processes, and iii) implementing optimised materials into boundary-pushing PV and LED devices. This will be achieved through a groundbreaking hierarchical analysis of the perovskite structures that not only characterises thin films and interfaces, but also the sub-units that comprise them, including grain-to-grain and sub-granular properties. The optoelectronic behaviour on these scales will be simultaneously correlated with local structural and chemical properties. HYPERION will use this fundamental understanding to eliminate non-radiative losses and ionic segregation on all scales through passivation treatments and compositional control. Addressing these knowledge gaps in the operation of perovskites will produce fundamental semiconductor science discoveries as well as illuminate routes to yield optimised and functional perovskites across the broad bandgap range 1.2â€“3.0 eV. These will be used to demonstrate all-perovskite tandem PV devices with efficiency exceeding crystalline silicon (26%), and white light LEDs with efficacies surpassing fluorescent light (50 lm/W).

While built and tested on the platform of the existing CorPower technology, the CERS braking module can be integrated in many types of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). Especially for point absorbers - undisputedly the WEC type with best prospects for large-scale development - WaveBoost will solve a central reliability challenge, the so-called 'end-stop' problem (excessive, uncontrolled forces when linear movement reaches end of stroke). Further, dedicated reliability assessment methods will be developed and applied.
CERS is an energy redistribution system that will allow WECs to absorb more energy from high energy wave cycles, temporarily storing excessive energy in the first step of the PTO chain, then releasing it for conversion through the remaining steps of the PTO in low energy wave cycles. Similar systems are being used in other sectors (e.g. automotive) but have not been applied to ocean energy. The additional damping force required to safely stop the motion of WECs in storm waves may be several times larger than the PTO force used to convert wave motion into electricity. By providing the extra damping needed from the CERS module, system survivability and reliability of critical components are significantly improved. Another consequence is a size reduction of the PTO for the same power rating, and an increase of the Annual Electricity Production (AEP). The technology allows WECS to operate at higher average loading, increasing average conversion efficiency.

676,672889,STERILISE,Safe sustainable reliable in-office processing of medical waste,"This innovation project aims to bring to technological maturity and market readiness a novel, cost effective, waste management unit - currently at Technology Readiness Level 7. Targeted specifically at the Medical Waste sector, the system has the potential to save the healthcare sector â‚¬1.2bn. By year five after project completion we plan to have generated cumulative revenues of â‚¬99m, create 90 jobs in the supply chain across Europe, and have generated a gross profit of at least â‚¬33m. 

In Europe, over 1.7m tonnes of medical waste is currently produced by the Healthcare sector every year. This waste includes needles (sharps), and dressings, bandages and surgical gloves (non-sharps). Medical waste cannot be disposed of by traditional refuse collection due to its hazardous nature. The waste must be placed in separately stored special bags and/or bins, transported in a dedicated disposal vehicle and carefully disposed of at hazardous waste registered sites where the waste is either autoclaved or incinerated. This is a costly process for e.g. medical practices. At present the handling of Medical Waste puts healthcare personnel as well as cleaning staff and waste collectors at risks through extensive manual handling and storage. 

The current SoA does not fully solve the problems described above and have a number of limitations. Therefore there is an urgent, unmet need for a system to reliably and safely solve the problem of handling of Medical Waste at source and provide a rapid return on investment to the customer. Our solution will give the following benefits to the end-users and Europe: 
â€¢ Easy and safe to use in an indoor office environment with no hazardous emission or odour;
â€¢ Lower cost than existing waste collection, i.e. leasing model with a low, fixed monthly outlay, savings of at least 30%;
â€¢ Eliminate the risk of contaminated waste being stored on premises for extended periods;

The main objective of the UPCYCLING THE OCEANS project is to produce and sell fabrics and clothes made from marine plastic litter, by recycling and industrial methods to convert these plastics into high properties textiles. 

European seas contain many tons of waste, mainly plastic (around 400 kg per km2). This plastic litter has a very negative impact in the marine environment even affecting the food chain (potentially triggering endocrine and/or carcinogenic processes).

To contribute to mitigate this problem ECOALF proposes to implement a collaborative scheme with fishermenâ€™s organisations (agreements already signed) to collect plastic from seas; to implement an industrial process that includes waste management, pellets production and additivation, spinning and fabrics, and clothes manufacturing; and to distributions and marketing the new products in Europe.

To that end ECOALF proposes a feasibility study:
-To analyse the economic feasibility of the initiative (production cost, volume of sales, incomes; relevant economic indicators; sensitive analysis).
-To identify logistical needs to obtain the marine plastic litter and to establish a mechanism to provide the consumer with a reliable Guarantee of Origin (GoO) that reflects that the clothes are made 100% from plastic waste and which percentage is from marine origin.
-To ensure the technical feasibility to additivate properly the flakes to obtain pellets that fulfill with ECOALF fabrics requirements. To define the adequate terrestrial / marine mix to ensure stability during the sinning process.
-To carry out a survey among clients and distributors to assess the market reaction to these products and to select at least four countries to carry out a market test.",2015-06-01,2015-11-30,50000.0,['Waste management'],"['waste management', 'recycling']",3,3

These waste are a key challenge as they cannot be treated as standard waste due to banning legislation and technical issues. 
Anaerobic Digestion is considered an interesting alternative for waste management and animal byproducts (ABP) are seen as an excellent substrate due to a high content of lipids and proteins
However, although the use of ABP to produce biogas represents a great opportunity for animal processors and biogas plant operators, there are limitations to its development: 
BPV is interesting from an industrial point of view because it reduces the number of steps of the waste processing and save energy (by 40%), is more efficient for biogas production than classic waste (28%), easy to implement and can be made serially at industrial premises. In the EU, biogas is a renewable biofuel, which does not contribute to climate change and can substitute to fossil fuels for production of heat and power.

The so formed 3D structures will serve as promising electrodes for the development of electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries and supercapacitors. Specifically, within this project atomically layered perovskites including La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3 (LSCF) and La1-xSrxMnO3 (LSM) will be synthesized through pulsed laser deposition and/or molecular beam epitaxy on pre-designed 3D substrates of Copper or Iron depending on growth conditions of perovskites and eventual applications of the electrodes. These substrates will be uniquely fabricated by nanoscribe printing of metals to cast a 3D scaffold like support for the growth of perovskites and later will be chemically etched off. Further, the performance of these perovskite constructs will be enhanced by depositing highly functional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This will serve as interconnects due to their excellent electrical, chemical and physical properties and overall enhance deviceâ€™s catalytic activity.
The custom designed formation of electrodes proposed in 3D-POWER will address the critical issues like reproducibility, low gravimetric density, and long range conduction. Innovative combination of perovskites in 3D scaffold architecture with the functional TMDs will propel new pathways for high performance electrochemical devices for energy storage and conversion.

Striving for global market leadership,"The R&D Team of Passerro GmbH has developed the BDVB â€“ Break Down Voltage - Basic Oil Stick. The BDVB Oil Stick, enables for the first-time online measurements of transformer oil dielectric breakdown strength. Using multi-frequency ultrasound spectroscopy, the Oil Stick determines simultaneously break down voltage (BDV), temperature (T) and oil humidity (Wc). 
Transformers are crucial infrastructure assets of Europeâ€™s and the worldâ€™s power grids, which must be controlled and governed carefully. Todayâ€™s power supply with huge but fluctuant shares of renewable energy (solar, wind) seriously stresses transformersâ€“ leading to an increased degeneration of the transformer insulating oil and thus to a significant influence of performance and decrease of their life time. If the oilâ€™s insulating capacity is down, transformers canâ€™t resist higher voltages as well as the power load and often break down in fire after short circuit. A transformer loss results most often in tremendous damages: loss of production capacity, loss of power supply, loss of grid stability and supply security. The replacement time of power transformers lasts up to 80 weeks and is cost intensive. To date, no reliable online monitoring of the crucial oil parameters is available, and the transformers are operated merely in a manner of blind flying.
Passerro developed the BDVB Oil Stick to TRL 6-7. Functionality has been successfully demonstrated, during long-time operation in transformers in Italy, Romania and Germany. The next step is the consequent commercialization and distribution of the device by efficient marketing and business development.   
The BDVB Oil Stick enables a groundbreaking transformer asset management system and allows the accurate utilization of the grid capacities. Moreover, it is a key enabling technology towards a smart grid.",2018-09-01,2019-02-28,50000.0,['Wind'],"['smart grid', 'renewable energy']",3,3

The EU has put nanotechnology at the top of its scientific agenda as a key enabling technology with huge potential for
addressing societal challenges including energy supply and health care, which SENTINEL will help to achieve.
The overarching objective of the SENTINEL program is to join together leading teams from across Europe, with global partners in industry (SMEs and multinationals) and the academic sector in the USA and China, to train a new generation of scientists who have the skills to tackle electrochemistry at individual entities such nanoparticles (metal, semiconducting, soft matter), living cells at the nanoscale, as well as single redox-active (macro)molecules.

685,764545,TURBO-REFLEX,TURBOmachinery REtrofits enabling FLEXible back-up capacity for the transition of the European energy system,"The energy sector accounts for two thirds of the global CO2 emissions and is therefore crucial to ensure future green growth and to achieve the global emission reduction targets. Substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can only be achieved by large scale deployment of renewable energy sources, including in particular the most abundant energy sources, wind and sun. Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap. As there are no large scale storage solutions available yet, other backup capacities are needed. The installed fossil capacity is large enough to provide this back-up power. However, the plants were designed for baseload operation, which results in increased wear and costs through cyclic operation and unnecessarily high emissions in the start-up phase.
Providing technology upgrades to retrofit the installed power plants to enable flexible operation without penalties on life, cost and emissions is an opportunity to quickly provide the necessary backup capacity to keep the energy system stable and resilient and at the same time enabling higher renewable shares.
TURBO-REFLEX will follow this approach and has selected technologies for retrofitting critical parts of thermal power plants which have already seen experimental proof-of-concept and are expected to significantly contribute to flexible operation. The technologies will reduce the minimum load, increase the ramp rates and reduce the costs per cycle. This will be achieved by new compressor designs for off-design operability, technologies in the hot gas path, in combustor and turbine, and by new materials, models and sensors to monitor and ensure the mechanical integrity in flexible operation.

Novel technologies play an enabling role in the realization of such solutions. Better devices for the detection of annihilation quanta resulting from positron annihilation are an example. In material science these detectors are needed for research on renewable energies and innovative energy storage using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). In medicine they are required for diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring of diseases using Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET).
In both fields time resolution is a key parameter. Sub-100 picosecond resolution is needed but not yet available. Improvement of time resolution, however, must not deteriorate other performance parameters. This project aims to overcome present physical limits. Monolithic scintillation crystals will be read out with digital photon counter (DPC) arrays coupled to each of its surfaces. Innovative data processing methods will be developed to eliminate the influence of scintillation photon propagation, currently the major bottleneck in large scintillation crystals that are nevertheless needed for high detection efficiency.

The project targets a pure hydrogen separation system with power and cost of < 5 kWh/kgH2 and < 1.5 â‚¬/kgH2. A pilot designed for 25 kg/day of hydrogen will be built and tested.

To achieve this, HyGrid aims at developing novel hybrid system integrating three technologies for hydrogen purification integrated in a way that enhances the strengths of each of them: Membrane separation technology is employed for removing H2 from the â€œlow H2 contentâ€ (e.g. 2-10 %) followed by electrochemical hydrogen separation (EHP ) optimal for the â€œvery low H2 contentâ€ (e.g. <2 %) and finally temperature swing adsorption (TSA) technology to purify from humidity produced in both systems upstream. The objective is to give a robust proof of concept and validation of the new technology (TRL 5) by designing, building, operating and validating a prototype system tested at industrial relevant conditions for a continuous and transient loads. To keep the high NG grid storage capacity for H2, the separation system will target the highest hydrogen recovery.

The project will describe and evaluate the system performance for the different pressure ranges within 0.03 to 80 bar (distribution to transmission) and test the concept at pilot scale in the 6-10 bar range.

It exists under extreme conditions in stars and planets.  Nuclear fusion, requires creating such extreme temperature and pressure on earth.  Lightweight storage of hydrogen in condensed form would unleash its potential as a fuel. The behaviour of a collection of protons and electrons presents an iconic challenge in fundamental physics.

Diamond anvil cells (DAC) recently generated pressures above 400GPa, accessing conditions where the mechanical work of compression equals the chemical bonding energy.  Most elements undergo dramatic structural changes in this regime, and rival predictions for hydrogen include molecular and atomic metals, superfluidity, superconductivity and one-dimensional melting.  Yet when the new phase IV was discovered in 2011, it was none of these things: it was a totally unexpected complex molecular insulator. At these conditions experimental data is sparse: we must exploit it to the fullest extent, yet previous theoretical work has concentrated on routine density functional theory (DFT) simulation producing unmeasurable predictions.  I will conduct a programme combining neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy with theory and simulation focused on measurable quantities.  This will require developing and implementing heuristic theories which do not currently exist.

I will develop methods to find free energy, theory to extract Raman frequencies and linewidths from simulation, and techniques to determine the signature from entanglement of quantum rotors.

Waste from biostreams and different biobased sources are being under-utilised as potential resource of valuable compounds. Fertilisers play an important role as suppliers of nutrients relying on their production heavily on fossil mineral resources. European Fertiliser industry is besides very dependent on imports of these raw materials, being vulnerable to supply and pricing policies.
Main objective of the proposal is to build up a breakthrough concept of Fertiliser Industry, strengthening European competitiveness and boosting the biobased economy potential, through the development of a new value chain, which will achieve turning solid and liquid residues, specifically ashes of different origins and livestock effluents, into high quality valuable products, a new generation of fertilisers. NEWFERT will focus on a viable and cost-effective industrial nutrient recycling scheme, developing new biorefining technologies aimed at increasing nutrient recovery ratios and mitigating environmental and socio-economical impact of the current fertilisers by replacing non renewable and fossil nutrients with biobased materials in their composition. Projected benefits also include substantial energy savings and CO2 emissions reduction. NEWFERT aims to decrease raw material dependency, prevent resource depletion and reduce the environmental impact increasing significantly the Fertiliser industry sustainability. The work organisation has been designed to link and pursue a successful industrial integration supported by a solid life-cycle cost analysis. The strategy of the work plan is based on 8 workpackages.

One option to address this is to use excess generator capacity during off-peak demand periods to produce hydrogen (H2), a high energy-content, carbon-free fuel that can be mixed with natural gas and distributed to end-users via existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure, where its energy content is recovered via combustion in conventional gas-turbine (GT) power plants. H2-enrichment, however, dramatically alters the combustion dynamics of natural-gas and its effect on turbulent flame dynamics, combustion stability and pollutant formation in GT combustors is not well enough understood today for this scenario to be safely implemented with existing power plants.

The objective of this study is to facilitate Europeâ€™s transition to a reliable and cost-effective energy system based on carbon-free renewable power generation. It will accomplish this by developing advanced laser measurement techniques for use in high-pressure combustion test facilities and using them to acquire the data necessary to develop robust predictive analysis tools for hydrogen-enriched natural gas combustor technology.

Simplicity is at the core of OpenHydroâ€™s design philosophy: the turbine has only one moving part, minimising the number of interventions for maintenance. Fundamentally, the Open-Centre Turbine system is designed to deliver the lowest cost of energy. Since the installation of OpenHydroâ€™s first turbine in 2006, the technology has been developed and tested extensively, with prototype designs optimised to provide higher outputs and improved economics. Validation of the full-scale, 2.0MW 16 metre turbine system following the deployment, grid connection and operation of a two turbine array at the Paimpol-BrÃ©hat test site in France brings the technology to TRL 7. OpenHydroâ€™s stated objective is to match and beat the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) of offshore wind. 

The OCTTIC FTI Pilot project, which brings together a consortium of 4 industrial partners led by OpenHydro, will achieve this through advancement of the turbine system design to improve performance, efficiency and reliability. These advancements when combined with a reduction in operational and maintenance requirements, will deliver significant reductions in capital and operational costs to achieve LCoE targets. OCTTIC will establish a robust industrial production platform and the associated supply chain to produce, assemble and deploy the turbines at scale to deliver LCoE targets and lead the development of the tidal energy market.

waste management are more restrictive each year (e.g Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC), but unfortunately, landfill disposal still
represents 34% of total MSW generated. On the other hand, citizen awareness as well as the high fees operators pay for
landfill disposal, have helped to greatly increase the percentage for recycling from 18% in 1995, to 42% in 2012.

However, 40% of all the glass waste ends up in mixed MSW plants (which typically contain 7% of glass). Instead of being
disposed of in selective-waste collection, it ends up in landfills or is composted/incinerated with the remnant waste.

We have developed SEEGLASS, a high performance optical sorter based on computer vision and a pneumatic rejection
system. Our aim is to solve this non-environmentally friendly problem, while also offering our end-users additional revenues
with this recovered material, which is not being exploited now (49â‚¬/tn glass). In addition, extracting this glass, will allow the
treatment plants to significantly reduce costs from waste disposal fees (50â‚¬/Tonne EU average and rising). Payback for
customers is estimated in only 19 months.

With this project we will (i) construct pre-conditioning process line, (ii) optimise our current SEEGLASS computer vision
system as well as its mechanical and pneumatic design, to reach 80% glass recovery, with 99% purity, (iii) integrate both,
the process line and the glass sorter solution into a demonstrator system, and (iv) validate its feasibility in-house with real
MSW coming from different countries, as well as carry-out an 24/7 end-user validation.

Besides the intrinsic interest of this system in relation to security and environment, it is also mandatory by legislation to be installed in all the new cars in the USA and it will be mandatory by the end of 2014 for all new models, what makes an increment of around 50 million vehicles equipped with this system until 2015. Taking into account 4 devices per vehicle, it turns out in 200million TPMS units.
This project will lead the company growth for the next years from a high technology solution developer to an important stakeholder in automotive industry.

- High-Class Concrete (HCC), encompassing materials with enhanced performance in strength,  durability;
- Fibre-reinforced Cementitious Composites (FCC), with special features on fibre/textile reinforcement and matrix improvement.

Developing synergetic through-life multi-scale models for these novel materials is the key objective of the SUPERCONCRETE project. Particularly, three transversal modelling issues (MIs) are considered:
- Rheology and Early age, dealing with the various physical and coupled thermo-hygro-chemical phenomena taking place in the first hours after mixing;
- Hardened state and service life, approached by constitutive modelling intended at predicting the instantaneous and long-term behaviour, for both service and ultimate conditions;
- Extreme conditions, based on constitutive theories capable of simulating the response under fire and high temperature exposure.

Each CC and MI is covered by one participant and the interactions among them is based on a matrix-like organisational approach aiming at achieving a true synergistic collaboration among those with specific CC knowledge and the ones bringing in transversal competences on MIs. A further cross-cutting objective aims at defining a  â€œSustainability Indexâ€, based on its constituents and processes requested for each CC.

HELIOVIS developed a lightweight pneumatic technology for solar concentrators which allows 55% cost savings and 40% CO2 reduction compared to the best future parabolic trough technologies. The HELIOtube is an inflatable cylindrical concentrator made of plastic films. Its full scale/commercial size is 220m long with a diameter of 9m. It can concentrate light by a factor of 100 and heats the thermal receiver fluid to a temperature of 400 to 600Â° C, enough to provide steam to turbines for electricity generation. HELIOtubes will be manufactured by a fully automated roll-to-roll process and in large

The effectiveness of the MDLT will be demonstrated through on-field tests on a real micro-Combined Heat and Power system (2.5 kW), thus moving these tools from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to beyond 5. 

INSIGHT leverages the experience of previous projects and consolidates their outcomes both at methodological and application levels. The consortium will specifically exploit monitoring approaches based on two advanced complementary techniques: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in addition to conventional dynamic stack signals. Durability tests with faults added on purpose and accelerated tests will generate the data required to develop and validate the MDL algorithms.

Currently produced from fossil-fuels (natural gas and coal), this artificial Nitrogen (NH3) can only be absorbed by plants once it is transformed by microorganisms into NO3-. However, during this biological process, up to 70% of N is lost into the soil, resulting in soil and water pollution. Only in Europe, the direct cost derived from this contamination has been quantified in around 14 billion/year.

VitalFluid, start-up with long expertise in plasma technology, has developed an innovative plasma nitrogen fixation unit -PLAN2FIX- able to extract N directly from the air and dissolve it into water on the spot, through our patented plasma activation technology. The resulting water (plasma activated water, PAW) is enriched in NO3-, which is readily absorbed by plants. PAW can be used as N-fertilizer and customized so that the exact amount of N the plant can absorb is delivered, and thus no N is lost into the environment.

Our N-enriched PAW is a sustainable and non-pollutant alternative to synthetic N-fertilizers that increases the uptake of nutrients by 20%, has an optimal acidity of pH 5,5 and active oxygen species that kill pathogens and serves as an extra oxygen nutrient. Besides, PLAN2FIX can be powered by renewable energy and connected to the irrigation system, providing a practically free zero-carbon PAW on the spot. No transport, storage, or distribution network is needed to supply farmers with our fertilizer, availability is ensured while price volatility (fossil-fuel price) avoided.

Consequently, a game changer in the technology is necessary. PRETZEL consortium will develop a 25 kW PEM electrolyzer system based on a patented innovative cell concept that is potentially capable of reaching 100 bar differential pressure. The electrolyzer will dynamically operate between 4 and 6 A cm^(-2) and 90 Â°C achieving an unprecedented efficiency of 70%. This performance will be maintained for more than 2000 h of operation. Moreover, the capital cost of stack components will be largely reduced by the use of non-precious metal coatings and advanced ceramic aerogel catalyst supports. Likewise, the system balance of plant (BoP) will be optimized for cost reduction and reliability. The high pressure hydrogen generator will become part of the product portfolio of a German manufacturer but at the end of PREZEL, this company will establish a supply business partnership and R&D collaboration with France, Spain, Greece and Rumania, strengthening and consolidating cooperation among EU states with contrasting economies. Lastly, the hydrogen produced by the PEM electrolyzer will not be wasted, but rather used for feeding the fuel cell test stations in one of the partnerâ€™s laboratory.",2018-01-01,2020-12-31,1999088.75,['Fuel'],"['renewable energy', 'fuel cell']",3,3

Based on a whole-building performance approach, the toolkit is conceived to achieve extremely high levels of energy efficiency in the existing residential building stock, with particular reference to Central and Southern Europe, where climate change and energy transition have boosted electricity consumption peaks both during summer and winter seasons. However, it may be extended equally well to new residential and commercial buildings.
The systemâ€™s central core consists of a cloud-based computing platform which concentrates managing and operational logic to support decision-making in planning and construction as well as energy performance enhancement and monitoring during operation. The Toolkit provide energy saving, energy fluxes optimization, data exchange, stakeholdersâ€™ active involvement and Smart Grid interactivity.
Interoperable building technologies and installations are also integrated in the toolkit: envelope solutions (thermal insulation and windows) ensure a reduction of thermal loads, while technical systems (BEMS, BIPV, heat pump, fan-coils, power controller, storage systems) ensure energy efficiency and RES exploitation.
All technical systems and building components are structured as a function of their affordability, interactivity, practicality, reduced installation time and non-invasiveness.
HEART's contribution to the improvement of the building renovation process can be briefly summarized through its main features:
â€¢ Retrofit planning and implementation optimization;
â€¢ Reduction of total energy consumption;
â€¢ Reinforcement of RES exploitation;

In TEMPO, six innovations related to networks, digitisation thereof and building optimisation undergo final development (TRL7-8). The innovations are combined into 3 solution packages suitable for 3 different application areas:  new LT DH networks in urban areas, new LT DH networks in rural areas, and existing (HT) networks. The benefits of these solution packages to reduce network temperatures will be demonstrated in 3 selected representative demos. The Vattenfall demo is a new urban LT network whereby solution package 1 will be demonstrated to reduce temperatures and therefore to enable integration of a geothermal energy source and cooling. The Enerpipe demo is a new rural LT network whereby solution package 2 will be demonstrated to reduce temperatures and so can open up the possibility to integrate a renewable energy source at a later stage. The existing network of A2A currently operates at a very high supply temperature. By integrating solution package 3, with particular emphasis on end consumer engagement, reduction in network temperatures will be similarly demonstrated. A comparable monitoring approach will ensure optimal network performance (reliability and durability) assessment and to foster maximal replication options in other areas.

Ethanol and ethylene are high-value eCO2RR products with key roles as a fuel and as a chemical building block, respectively. However, current electrocatalysts are very inefficient in producing these multi-carbon compounds. This action proposes the investigation of an exciting and highly innovative strategy in eCO2RR catalysisâ€”based on functionalizing the catalyst surface with tailored thiol ligandsâ€”with a clear potential to overcome the mechanistic hurdles toward C2 product formation. To this end, STRATCAT-CO2 will adopt an interdisciplinary approach combining model catalysts, state-of-the-art characterization, and a close synergy between experimental and theoretical research to gain a mechanistic understanding of surface functionalization that can guide catalyst development. In addition, this action will build bridges between fundamental efforts and electrode and device engineering to achieve breakthrough performance under conditions relevant for practical implementation. STRATCAT-CO2 will provide fresh perspectives in catalyst design for the eCO2RR and, by reaching the foreseen performance targets, set the basis for the development of new electrochemical processes for ethanol and ethylene production. Furthermore, this action will establish an intra-European interdisciplinary network between emerging researchers at DTU and TU Delft.

Dr Richen Lin proposes an advanced AD-based circular economy system by introducing conductive materials (such as biocompatible graphene nanomaterial and digestate derived pyrochar) for third generation gaseous transport biofuel production from algae feedstock. The proposal will particularly explore the mechanism of efficient direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between bacteria and methanogens in the presence of conductive materials. The biomethane production rate and total energy recovery in the proposed system are expected to be enhanced by 20-40% as compared to existing AD technology. The goal will be achieved by the following research objectives: 1) Theoretically compare the efficiencies of MIET and DIET in AD; 2) Develop optimal strategies to stimulate DIET and improve biogas production from algae; 3) Outline a future circular economy system by introducing pyrochar into AD.

Novel types of batteries, â€œpost-lithium ionâ€, will challenge the Li-ion chemistries by advantages in cost, sustainability, elemental abundance or energy density. This requires significant improvements of the materials, not least regarding the electrolyte. The conventional liquid battery electrolytes pose a problem already for the mature Li-ion chemistries due to safety and cost, but are particularly destructive for future battery types such as Li-metal, organic electrodes, Li-S, Li-O2, Na- or Mg-batteries, where rapid degradation and loss of material are associated with incompatibilities with the electrolytes.

Renewable and waste heat sources are foreseen at the same time as de-carbonized heat sources and the way to guarantee competitive energy costs with limited influence of fossil fuel supply price volatility. To achieve this, conversion of DHs is needed regarding:
- The reduction of their operation temperature to avoid current technical constraints in the integration of low-grade industrial heat sources,
- The introduction of larger shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in the DH network.
- The introduction of distributed heat sources (reject heat from cooling equipment...).

The global energy crisis requires an urgent solution, we must replace fossil fuels for a renewable energy source: Solar energy. However, the efficient and inexpensive conversion and storage of solar energy into fuel remains a fundamental challenge. Currently, solar-energy conversion devices suffer from energy losses mainly caused by disorder in the materials used. The solution to this problem is to learn from nature. In photosynthesis, the photosystem II reaction centre (PSII RC) is a pigment-protein complex able to overcome disorder and convert solar photons into a separation of charges with near 100% efficiency. Crucially, the generated charges have enough potential to drive water oxidation and hydrogen production. 

Previously, I have investigated the charge separation process in the PSII RC by a collection of spectroscopic techniques, which allowed me to formulate the design principles of photosynthetic charge separation, where coherence plays a crucial role.

The system, using driving heat below 100Â°C, provides adequately low temperatures of -6Â°C as usable cold for industrial purposes and storage of food. With the ECOiCE AWA the company primarily focuses on market segments with continuously high need of refrigeration like supermarkets, hotels, catering and food processing firms for the provision of cold at competitive prices in line with demand.

The aim of the overall project is the strategic development of a new business area for the innovative technology and plant components in the field of application of absorption refrigeration engineering for industrial purposes within the company KKS. The vision of KKS comprises the international market leadership in the field of trigeneration of electricity, thermal heat and cold through cost-saving AWA, which works in the range of capacity up to 100 kW favourable for decentralized solutions and only requires driving heat at low temperatures. Within 7 years from the beginning of the project the number of jobs at KKS will rise by 20% up to 60 and the turnover for absorption chillers will account for 40 m euro per year.",2015-02-01,2015-07-31,50000.0,['Storage'],"['CHP', 'combined heat and power']",3,3

However, the intermittent nature of those resources demands high performing and cost-effective energy storage systems. Redox Flow Batteries (RFBs) present several advantages, namely, total decoupling of power and energy densities and the possibility of rapid mechanical charging by substituting spent electrolytes with fresh ones. The major issues of the current Vanadium RFBs are the high price and toxicity of vanadium components and the high cost and low performance of the ion-selective membranes they require. 
MFreeB project proposes to completely remove the problematic membrane of RFBs by developing a disruptive, versatile and scalable concept of Membrane-Free RFB implementing efficient catholytes and anolytes in which the metallic redox pairs are replaced by cheap, abundant and environmental-friendly molecules. In order to achieve this objective, I propose a multi- and interdisciplinary research methodology across a wide range of expertise including fundamental electrochemistry, thermodynamics, physical chemistry, modelling, and mechanical engineering. I will make use of advantages of different electrolytes to develop a versatile concept of Membrane-Free RFB with a wide range of applications.

The numbers demonstrate that we are wasting our natural capital at an accelerating pace. The time to act is now, by initiating large scale land restoration programs involving tree plantings. The ecosystem restoration market is globally estimated at US $300 billion. 

Towards this goal we have developed a unique, fully functional product (TRL 7), called â€˜Cocoonâ€™, to promote tree establishment in dryland environments. Acting as a tree incubator the Cocoon nourishes tree seedlings, resulting in high survival rates and increased resilience to adverse growing conditions, while maintaining water efficiency.
 
The scope of this FTI is to prototype an innovative manufacturing line in the EU with the following objectives:
1. Reach a production capacity of 1 million Cocoons per year
2. Achieve a production output of 125 units per hour (as compared to 40 units in status quo)
3. Reduce the manufacturing costs per Cocoon from â‚¬5 (currently) to â‚¬1 (target costs)
4. Reduce energy consumption by 50% & manufacture with 100% recycled energy from waste heat, solar heat and PV
5. Integrate local agriculture waste materials or grasses in the product 

When production cost can go down to â‚¬1, completely new, large-scale markets will open up. Our project will stimulate private sector investment in land regeneration projects and promote trans-disciplinary research & innovation (industrial design, organic waste recycling, biomass, renewable energy). Our sustainable innovations address societal needs of restoring degraded areas, especially in times of increasing pressures from climate change.

LRE main product is biogas compact plant, focus to small/medium energy projects (250-400 kW) where self-supply and waste management are the main targets. With BIOFERLUDAN project, LRE wants to take a step beyond responding new demands of cost-effective and reliable treatment for the digestate, the main by-product of these installations, developing an on-site recovery process to treat it obtaining high quality humic fertilizers.
BIOFERLUDAN aims to implement in biogas plants a new process to obtain liquid fertilizers with high organic matter content, in form of humic substances, recovering them from the digestate. Based on previous R&D works done by LRE, a biogas plant which use BIOFERLUDAN process will produce a minimum of 60L of fertilizer per ton of digestate. The implementation of the new solution will mean around 450.000 â‚¬/year of potential incomes for each plant.
Being a great business opportunity for LRE, the success of this approach relays on the fact that it will constitute a business and improvement opportunity for clients (biogas plants) as well as they will obtain outcomes such as:
â”€ Improved efficiency and productivity of the biogas plant recovering up to 55% and 25% of thermal and electrical energy surplus respectively produced
â”€ Diminution of operating cost reducing up to 50% volume of digestate managed (current digestate management cost reaches average annual expenditure of EUR 90,000 for each biogas plant)
â”€ Increased revenues by commercialisation of high quality fertilizers (450.000 â‚¬/year)
â”€ An estimated return period of the investment of 1,5 years

Their Reactivity and Applications for Materials,"Multiple bonds have an enourmous impact on our lives as they are extremely useful functionalities in important industrial chemical transformations and products. The new millennium has witnessed considerable progress in the chemistry of main group compounds with multiple bonds. In case of elements other than carbon, the utilization of bulky ligands, with the appropriate steric and electronic effects, is a crucial factor in the stabilization of such species. Nevertheless, heteronuclear compounds containing triple bonds between the heavier elements of Group 13 and Group 15 are so far unknown. This proposal will address this knowledge gap by the use of donor-acceptor interactions to stabilize such compounds. The hypothesis rests not only in the stabilization provided by the Lewis base species but also on the electronic features enforced by them. This proposal will utilize the tools of experimental and computational chemistry in tandem, as an efficient and predictive strategy to gain synthetic access to the hitherto unknown triple bonds. These structures will present a multifunctional character, by having two pi-bonds, a lone pair on the Group 15 element, and Lewis base donors. Thus, given the unique bonding situation, they are expected to serve as innovative reagents for the activation of organic small molecules, as well as excellent metal-free catalysts and versatile coordination ligands toward transition metals. Furthermore, the heteroatomic triple bond motif is expected to provide unprecedented precursors for growing high-quality III-V semiconductor films. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are: (i) to comprehensively design the syntheses of these unique compounds; (ii) to develop and exploit their reactivity and; (iii) to harvest their potential in materials science.

To grow 1 tonne of mushroom, 3 to 4 tonnes of substrate are needed. However, when mushroom production is completed the substrate cannot be used for another growing cycle due to the depletion of nutrients needed for mushroom growing and it is called Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS) and becomes a waste that should be managed according to regulations. In Europe, c.a. 3.65 million tons of SMS are generated each year. SMS is a high-moisture content bulk material rich in organic matter and nutrients and it could be reused in agriculture by adding it to the soils as amendment or mulch or weathered to be reused as casing soil. However, nitrates directive set a disposal limit that makes that large quantities of SMS cannot be simply spread in soils next to growersâ€™ facilities, as there is a high risk of leachates and water pollution. Due to its low bulk density and high water content, transportation costs are high and therefore storage is becoming a sound problem. SmartMUSHROOM aims to increase mushroom growersâ€™ waste management efficiency by using a new technology which allow them to obtain enough biogas from fresh SMS to dry a mixture of digestate and additional fresh SMS and pelletize it targeting to obtain a marketable high-quality organic fertilizer rich in organic matter and in nutrients, easy to handle, store and transport to any farming region in Europe. A perfect example of biobased circular economy. The aim of the project is to build a pilot plant to demonstrate the technology and find the best commercial formulation for the pellets to enter organic farming market.

To this end, systems that directly use the energy of sunlight to drive chemical reactions that otherwise would be thermodynamically uphill have been vigorously studied since the late 1960s. Such â€œsolar-to-fuelâ€ generating systems are targeted to store energy from sunlight in the form of chemical bonds which can be later broken with mild external stimulus to provide energy on-demand. Of these systems, the most studied for the collection and storage of solar energy is the photoinduced solar water splitting reaction, wherein liquid water is broken down into hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) using semiconductor photocatalysts. 

This proposal seeks to develop a novel nanoscale Hybrid Metal-Semiconductor Tetrapod Photocatalyst (HMST-PC) for solar energy conversion. This catalyst is specifically designed for the efficient generation of fuels (H2 and O2) from only sunlight and H2O. The nanocatalyst will consist of: i) four light-absorbing CdS antennae, ii) an embedded CdSe core to guide internal energetics, iii) a binary noble metal cocatalyst for H2 evolution, and iv) a robust metal-oxide cocatalyst for O2 evolution. 

In addition to developing an all-in-one solar photocatalyst, fundamental scientific advances made in this action will serve to i) expand the toolbox of precision nanomaterials synthetic methods available to researchers, ii) address long standing issues of charge-extraction in nanoscale catalyst systems, and iii) develop new methods to stabilize functional photocatalysts against photocorrosion.

Although our solution reached the pilot stage, our development is not yet completed. We need to enhancing its user interface to be more user friendly, integrating it with GIS systems and SCADA systems in order to make it more robust, versatile and easier to operate. ElGrid is of strategic importance to our company as it helps modify and extend our tool in which we have invested already 300 man months as well as to establish technological leadership in the new market segment.

It is often portrayed as either a blessing or a curse. Certainly, it is a prime candidate for producing low-carbon emission power. But no less important is the effect of hydrogen embrittlement which has resulted in many catastrophic failures of engineering alloys. In aid of this, SHINE will realise multiple ambitions. It will facilitate the direct imaging and quantification of H atoms in candidate metallic alloys and metal-organic frameworks for gaseous storage, allow the discovery of new solid-state hydrides with controlled release, and help the improvement of fuel cell materials for energy generation. All these applications have relevance to a â€˜low-carbon-emission economyâ€™ that humanity must develop in the 21st century. SHINE will exploit a novel and entirely unique infrastructure, designed and currently implemented in the PIâ€™s group. It will directly provide three-dimensional hydrogen mapping at the near-atomic scale. By connecting and relating this fundamental knowledge and observed physical properties, we will enable unprecedented precision in the prediction of material behaviour and so resolve to unlock control over the behaviour of hydrogen in such materials. Atom probe tomography will be the principal method of a correlative microscopy and spectroscopy approach to investigate materials where precise knowledge of the distribution of H is crucial. Informed by experimental data, modelling and simulations will provide a mechanistic understanding of the behaviour of H in materials.

Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) exhibit especially high melting temperatures and include the diborides and carbides of zirconium and hafnium (ZrC & HfC).  Unfortunately, UHTCs also suffer from poor fracture toughness, relatively poor oxidation resistance and are very difficult to process since the densification temperature required is also very high. EREMOZ will address these challenges by using a non-conventional process route along with a combination of fibre reinforcement and rare earth dopants. Specifically, processing will be based on the energy efficient process of chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) rather than more conventional sintering; the former allows dense composites to be produced at much lower temperatures. The poor fracture toughness will be improved by the introduction of silicon carbide fibres (SiCf) or carbon fibres (Cf), which enhance resistance to crack propagation. Finally, oxidation resistance will be improved by the introduction of second phases, such as those based on silicon and/or rare earths, which facilitate the formation of oxide scales that inhibit oxygen diffusion. The outcomes from this project will be three fold, to: 
1. Determine whether the presence of the rare earth element (e.g. La,Eu, Nd, Ce, Y) dopants will improve the properties and performance of the composites and whether they have any effect, positive or negative, on the processing required;

A major driver of both, energy consumption and energy costs are machine tools used the processing of materials, esp. in the automotive, mechanical engineering and aerospace segments. These machine tools are not only consuming huge amounts of energy, they also cause frequent power peaks, thus requiring very high connected loads. These peak loads have a negative effect on the European power grid stability, therefore, the provision of such high connected loads is very expensive.
As pioneer in the electrification of forming machine tools, EBM has developed Enerstor â€“ an electric energy power storage levelling module. This modular energy storage solution can be directly connected to any kind of machine tool, thus significantly reducing energy consumption of the machine tool and entirely levelling power peaks. This solution directly addresses current user needs of the European industry, including reduced energy costs through lower consumption and connected loads, higher flexibility in production, less emissions, and decreased investment costs. It helps the European industry and especially the segment for machine tools to stay competitive. With over 1,400 companies in Europe, the machine tools industry currently worth 25 bn â‚¬ is very important for Europe in terms of employment and wealth.

Bottlenecks affect security, data, storage management, servers and the data centre networks. 

Using groundbreaking sensor data reduction techniques, Teraki software enables users to extract the maximum potential of their IoT applications otherwise constrained by limited battery lifetime and/or prohibitive connectivity costs. 

We can leverage up to 10 times more data at the sensor level without additional computation resources. Battery life is improved; data transmission and processing latency and storage requirements are reduced. Privacy is strongly enhanced since only partial data is sent. The result is a 90% reduction in IT costs, and 50% less in maintenance costs for connected sensor systems. 

The most common data reduction solutions for sensor networks are compression techniques. Compression requires high computational resources at the sensor with high impact on battery life. Teraki will render embedded sensor compression techniques obsolete since our solution needs no additional resources and the data selection and further analysis can be done in real time.

The goal of this project is to identify the most appropriate IoT market verticals for commercialization and continue market validation activities. We will detail the technical challenges we need to address for widespread adoption of our innovation.  We will analyse risks and explore opportunities to enable new business models and become a game-changing force in the IoT sector.

746,719024,MDC,CNG Fuels- Mother and Daughter CNG Station Concept,"The EU is lagging the rest of the world in the adoption of natural gas as the only possible source of clean, cheap fuel for heavy transport applications. The tide of economics and regulation is moving in favour of natural gas, yet the infrastructure has proven too expensive and too inflexible to meet demand  both conveniently and economically. Gas grid infrastructure has defined the location of cheap gas, as mobile solutions are not scaleable and too expensive for mass adoption. 

Global trends identified in this proposal show that rapid gas adoption rates have been closely linked to the provision of infrastructure beyond a critical mass level, a process we believe we can rapidly accelerate. 

CNG Fuels have pioneered the concept of using high pressure gas grid connections to build Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refuelling stations which produce the lowest cost gas, with the lowest emissions profile, and produce it far more abundantly than other stations throughout Europe. Our new CNG Station in Leyland, is feeding a customer's off grid 'daughter' station via CNG trailer.

What is becoming clear to us is that we can sell a lot more gas to a lot more fleets by focussing our high pressure 'mother' stations on the provision of very cheap gas to CNG trailers for them to then fuel vehicles at 'daughter' stations, located where the customers want them, i.e. close to the depot or on the major transport routes. 

We intend to build stations that focus on fuelling large numbers of CNG trailers simultaneously. Locating our mother stations where the cheapest gas can be produced, i.e. the cheapest land, close to highest pressure gas grid. Our production levels will provide us bulk gas and electricity discounts as a high volume user. We can pass the savings on to our customers so that they can transport the gas and still supply it cheaply.

The main objective of MirrorPV phase 1 project is to perform a feasibility study of our innovation idea in order to verify the technological, practical, market and economic viability of the innovation.
MirrorPV is an innovative patent pending technology that increases the productivity of the photovoltaic solar systems when the sun is low above the horizon by increasing their illumination.
The specific objectives of SCAD towards MirrorPV phase 2 and phase 3 project and expected outcomes by 2018 are â€“ To develop the MirrorPV innovation to a series of prefabricated modules with a different shape, width, height and inclination towards PV panels; To develop and establish a distribution network for the Balkan market by the end of 2017 and penetration the rest of European market by the end of 2018; Using specific communication and promotion channels, to demonstrate the efficiency, capability and qualities MirrorPV as cost effective solution; To achieve commercialization of the MirrorPV in EU market by the end of 2018.

750,711392,BioCarbon,Rapid tree-planting through the use of remote sensing and unmanned vehicle planting technologies for large scale reforestation,"Currently used methods for reforestation and tree-planting such as hand planting and direct seeding  are time-consuming and expensive. As a result tree-planting has been unable to keep up with number of trees lost each year. Right now we are facing a net global loss of 6.6 billion trees each year. 
The EU is currently seeking out solutions to facilitate the sustainable supply of materials for the future and BioCarbon Engineering have developed a planting system to enable industrial scale reforestation protecting and regenerating forest resources. The planting system developed by BioCarbon Engineering consists of a mapping unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a planting UAV and machine learning software. It is a massive improvement on current reforesting techniques being a fully automated process and it will simultaneously enable cheaper and faster tree planting (10 seeds planted per UAV per minute). Given that the planting is being carried out by an aerial vehicle, it is possible to plant in terrain that is inaccessible by land-based approaches. It therefore offers a higher return on investment since it can carry out the same activity at a lower cost while also having a greater reach for tree planting.
The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with the automated planting solution being demonstrated out in different ecosystems throughout Europe, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.",2015-12-01,2016-03-31,50000.0,,"['reforestation', 'direct seeding']",2,3

However, uptake of natural gas as a light vehicle fuel is heavily restricted by lack of an EU public fuelling infrastructure. Within the scope of the overall project, gasfill Limited (UK) aim to bring to mass market a novel low-cost, high-throughput personal refuelling appliance for NGVs, with a step change in the compressed natural gas fill rate obtained from standard mains gas and electricity supplies. The personal refuelling appliance is based on a patented multi-stage compression architecture, and the innovation supports accelerated payback within 15 months for single and multi-car users in the target domestic and small commercial markets, as well as the first feasible ownership of NGVs in areas without public filling stations. Complementary to rapid growth in the NGV market, the addressable market is projected to be 133,000 units in Europe and globally by 2020.
Steps required to prepare the technology for exploitation on this level include: value engineering; a robust EU supply chain; detailed knowledge of EU target markets and drivers/barriers, country-specific critical failure factors and mains gas infrastructure; initial exploitation strategy for maximum market penetration; EU certification of product/installation procedure; strategy to form critical mass market growth complementary to NGVs. 
The proposed Phase 1 feasibility study seeks to address these requirements by delivery of priority matrix and roadmap for EU exploitation; roadmap for EU-wide certification; IP roadmap; system and component specifications including make/buy decisions for mass production; detailed project plan and scope for main project; installation specification; detailed market forecasts and return-on-investment capability as a function of NGV uptake.",2015-10-01,2016-03-31,50000.0,['Fuel'],['compressed natural gas'],2,3
752,712022,ENERCOVERY,Modular green-energy recovery and business model,"Gasification is a thermal process that converts organic matter into fuel gas (Syngas) at high temperatures (above 600 ÂºC). When Syngas is burnt in a combustion engine, simultaneous production of electricity and heat is obtained in one only step. The main limitation of current gasification plants are the great amount of wastes needed to work properly, which makes this technology very difficult to be implemented in industrial sectors with less quantity of wastes production. This market demands a more flexible, modular and portable technology.
On the other hand, the pellet production is a process with very high energy consumption, mainly due to the need of raw material drying, and with a waste product suitable for energy recovery by gasification.
The general objective of this innovation project is to place in market a breakthrough energy technology for pellet manufacturing industries with high energy consumption that will allow valorising their wastes, currently with none or less economic value, by means of a modular and portable gasification-CHP plant installed in their facilities. Additionally, the project development will help to solve a serious environmental problem caused by the excessive accumulation of wastes in landfills.
In order to reach this objective, the consortium will validate the study of this energy technology carried out in pellets manufacturing industries by scaling-down the gasification plant currently used for tens of tonnes per day of waste and optimise the functional parameters to the type of waste treated to ensure the same process yield as bigger plants.
Phase 1 of ENERCOVERY aims to ensure the viability of the project. A technical analysis on the viability of the implementation of a gasification-CHP plant in pellet manufacturing process and a business plan will be developed.",2015-12-01,2016-04-30,50000.0,['Fuel'],['CHP'],2,3
753,673824,ELECTHANE,Microbiological conversion of renewable electricity and CO2 to a natural gas quality bio-fuel,"OWS wants to commercialize a biological process that converts CO2 and H2 (after electrolysis of renewable electricity) to CH4 (main component in natural gas). Lab and pilot tests have been and are being conducted and show promising results. A next step in the development is creating a sound business model for further commercialization, and the construction of a first plant at full-scale for further optimization and demonstration purposes to potential clients.

As renewable energy sources are gaining more ground in the electricity mix in Europe, imbalance problems on the electricity grid will increase in frequency. The proposed concept offers a solution to this imbalance problem by converting excess electricity via hydrolysis to H2 and using (waste) CO2 to CH4 that can be injected into the gas grid. The advantage of the proposed system is the small scale (< 10 MWe), so the conversion can be done near the production sites.

When there is an excess of renewable electricity, fees are paid to the operators of renewable electricity for not producing, thus avoiding grid imbalance. Although this approach is understandable from a balancing perspective, it is contradictory to a sustainable approach and in conflict with the existing renewable energy targets. Therefore, producers of renewable electricity are a first important target group for our technology.

CO2-intensive industries are a second important target group. By recycling their waste CO2, they become more sustainable, and it can generate extra revenues from buffering activities.

During the feasibility study, OWS wants to elaborate a sound business plan for further development of the technology. It should result in a clear vision on technical, economic and legal issues. The final goal is to build a first full-scale demonstration plant in phase 2, which can serve as a test facility for further optimization (technical/biological), but also as a demonstration plant for potential customers.",2015-06-01,2016-05-31,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'recycling']",2,3
754,661323,CarboPlex,"Development of carbon-rich biochar-mineral complexes for soil amendment, carbon sequestration and beyond (CarboPlex)","Aim of this project is to investigate and exploit the potentials of a new material termed biochar-mineral complex (BMC). The simple yet ground-breaking idea is to use common waste streams to produce BMCs with distinct properties. Primary target is the use of BMCs as soil amender, especially in soils, where the delicate but crucial structure of organo-mineral complexes is threatened by unsustainable soil use or climate change. Where pure biochar is known to face its limits, BMC because of its mineral part is assumed to enable much higher functionality (i.e. water and nutrient storage). To provide evidence-based information on production, properties and soil effects of BMC, a systematic study will be conducted. The highly interdisciplinary work is split into five strongly interconnected work packages, which cover the whole BMC lifespan from production to soil use and technology assessment. Most of the work will be conducted at the University of Edinburgh (UoE). A secondment is planned at Enrich Environmental Ltd., an innovative Irish waste treatment SME, where the potentials and requirements for successful large-scale implementation will be investigated. Introducing this original work to the scientific communities (i.e. waste, agriculture, soil, material science) is expected to make enormous impact. Strong attention is also paid to dissemination of the results to the industry, other stakeholders and the general public. The ER, in addition to the expected excellent research, profits greatly from new experiences with pyrolysis (UKBRC) and business management (Enrich) supporting his strive for an academic career as professor. The UoE benefits from the ERâ€™s experiences in hydrothermal carbonization and gaining competence in BMCs. Enrich, in return, has strong interest to expand its range of products and to integrate innovative processes such as BMC production.

755,673647,Watergate,Watergate: Development of a low-cost solar desalination technology,"The Watergate project aims to bring to the market by 2017 the most competitive desalination solution for middle scale applications, a market niche accounting for 900 Million â‚¬ of annual investment in 2014. Its major value-added lies in the unique combination of a total independence on fossil fuel, the solution requiring only solar energy, and very competitive water costs ranging between 0.80â‚¬ and 2â‚¬/m3 for applications above 100m3/day. 

The major innovation of Watergate lies in the fact that the whole system â€œdesalination-energy sourceâ€ has been redesigned, resulting in an integrated system that solves the critical issue of the low efficiency of renewable energy desalination. The value-added of Watergate relies on two pillars: 
- The reduction of the size of the required solar field by more than 20% through a minimization of the energy consumption and a maximization of the energy efficiency; 
- The absorption of the variations in energy intensity, making it possible to work without any complementary energy source. 

The market potential for Watergate is substantial. It will not only target the current low to middle scale market accounting for 500,000 m3/day of yearly installed capacity, it will also boost the development of desalination in energy importing countries: Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Greece and Israel; as well as extend the scope of the market to users with no access to fossil fuel. 

Under Phase 1 of the SME Instrument, the feasibility study will first focus on the definition of the business positioning of Cyrga. The resulting identification of the targeted segments and the relevant business model will make it possible to develop a corresponding marketing strategy and adapt the financial plan, providing the missing parts for the elaboration of a strategic business plan by September 2015.

Our solution, InjectoReducer, provides an enabling technology towards meeting the rule requirement for Euro 4-6 Regulation Compliance. It offers reduced (handling, installation and maintenance) costs, increased energy efficiency, reduced emissions, increased ease and speed of installation as well as servicing.

As such, InjectoReducer has been developed in line with Europe's transport and mobility goals for the year 2050. Our solution will be an enabling innovation towards ridding cities of conventionally-fuelled cars in cities as well as reducing 60% of transport emissions by the middle of the century.

This will enhance our ability to understand and monitor dynamic subsurface processes that are key to the protection and sustainable use of water resources. ENIGMA focuses mainly on critical zone observation, but the anticipated technological developments and scientific findings will also contribute to monitor and model the environmental footprint of an increasing range of subsurface activities, including large-scale water abstraction and storage, enhanced geothermal systems and subsurface waste and carbon storage. While many subsurface structure imaging methods are now mature and broadly used in research and practice, our ability to resolve and monitor subsurface fluxes and processes, including solute transport, heat transfer and biochemical reactions, is much more limited. The shift from classical structure characterization to dynamic process imaging, driven by ENIGMA, will require the development of multi-scale hydrogeophysical methods with adequate sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, and novel inverse modelling concepts. For this, ENIGMA will gather (i) world-leading academic teams and emerging companies that develop innovative sensors and hydrogeophysical inversion methods, (ii) experts in subsurface process upscaling and modelling, and (iii) highly instrumented field infrastructures for in-situ experimentation and validation. ENIGMA will thus create a creative and entrepreneurial environment for trainees to develop integrated approaches to water management with interdisciplinary field-sensing methods and novel modelling techniques.

763,679789,CONTREX,Controlling Triplet Excitons in Organic Semiconductors,"The urgent need to reduce carbon emissions in order to mitigate climate change requires the development of clean, renewable energy sources. Solar power offers a virtually unlimited supply of energy, providing it can be harnessed efficiently. Traditional silicon solar cells demonstrate high performance (~20%) but their required method of manufacture prohibits large area production rendering them too expensive to be used on a global scale. Organic solar cells (made from conjugated polymers and fullerenes) have the potential to be fabricated by low cost printing methods allowing for large scale modules to be produced cheaply. Conventional organic solar cells function by generating charge from a singlet excited state. In order to achieve optimum performance the precise morphology of polymer and fullerene must be controlled which can be extremely challenging. These devices however, have attained good efficiencies (10%) but are hampered by severe loss mechanisms which generally involve the formation of a lower energy triplet excited state. 

We propose to develop novel materials for organic solar cells which will instead utilise this triplet excited state to generate charges. This will enable us to not only eliminate this loss mechanism but due to the unique properties of the triplet excited state will allow for numerous benefits. Firstly, the long lifetime of the triplet excited state will be exploited to allow for a simpler organic solar cell where precise morphological control is not required. Secondly, the proposed new materials will allow for the utilisation of near-IR light which is typically wasted in ALL current solar cell devices. Thirdly, exploiting a unique photophysical process we will produce materials capable of delivering efficiencies in excess of the theoretical limit available to conventional solar cells. Thus we propose that utilisation of triplet excitons is the required step-change to allow for organic solar cells to achieve their ultimate efficiencies",2016-04-01,2021-03-31,1499223.0,,"['solar cell', 'renewable energy']",2,3

In addition, the very question about material stability and reliable measurement procedures are still debated.
CHEOPS will now scale up the lab results to single junction modules manufactured in a pre-production environment while maintaining high efficiencies (>14% stable for aperture area in modules >15x15cm2). This will demonstrate the potential of PK as a very low-cost technology (target <0.3â‚¬/Wp) well suited for building-integrated PV.
In parallel, CHEOPS will develop materials and processes to achieve very high efficiency (>29% on 2x2cm2 cells) at low cost (target <0.4â‚¬/Wp) using a tandem configuration with a crystalline silicon heterojunction cell.
CHEOPS will also perform a sustainability assessment from a life-cycle perspective to anticipate potential risks for the technology (including business, technological, environmental, social & political risks). CHEOPS will establish a quantified future development roadmap as well as protocols for stability testing and for reliable measurements.
CHEOPS partners cover the whole value added chain: key PK researchers, groups with track records of scaling up high efficiency and tandem cell developments, specialised technology and service providers as well as SMEs and industry partners with already strong IP portfolios, ready to exploit the CHEOPS results.

Then, research and innovation actions in this topic are focused on finding new technical solution, developing emerging technologies and improving heat transfer efficiency of existing systems. There is required, on the one hand, a better knowledge of the thermal properties of the ground and, on the other, the efficient implementation of thermal energy transfer technologies.
ITER Project (Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal ground heat exchangers) totally agree with these purposes. In fact, the overall aim of ITER is to ensure the sustainability of ground coupled heating-cooling systems and especially the horizontal ground heat exchangers systems. Key challenges are (i) to enhance the heat transfer of the ground surrounding the pipes creating thermally enhanced backfilling material (TEBM) suitable for horizontal systems; (ii) to assess the performance and the environmental impacts of new promising technological solutions as helix systems with and without TEBM; (iii) to monitor the results over time through direct measurements and numerical simulation.
Thermal laboratory measurements and in situ monitoring of existing and duly installed horizontal systems will be provided by close cooperation between host institutions and non-academic partners.

Currently, perovskite-based solar cells(SC) are receiving increasing attention due to their low cost and high efficiency. They are very promising as an alternative for the existing ones, but still need to advance to reach higher efficiency and durability and require synthesis methods compatible with the industrial production of CMOS devices at wafer scale. These recent SC are mostly fabricated via wet methods in planar architecture. Inherent to the nature of the wet approaches, usually appear several drawbacks as contaminations and chemical reactions on the interfaces that might result deterioration of the SC performance.
PlasmaPerovSol main objective is the fabrication of a complete perovskite solar cell device by a full plasma and vacuum integrated process carried out under the premises of the â€œone reactor conceptâ€. Thus, the different components of the solar cell will be deposited sequentially within a vacuum reactor avoiding exposition of the materials and interfaces to air or solvents. The technology developed by the hosting group combine vacuum deposition assisted by plasma that permits the fabrication of conformal layers over a large variety of templates. This approach is also proposed here to fabricate conformal multilayers over 1D scaffold that will demonstrate the advantages of 1D-SC. Plasma and vacuum processes present as advantage the high purity and stoichiometric control on the deposition within an ample range of materials compositions. The synthesis approach is compatible with large scale industrial production and allows the fabrication of SC on processable and flexible substrates.

In addition, these cells are manually assembled into stacks resulting in extra steps for joining and sealing that difficult the standardization and quality control of the final product while introducing weak parts likely to fail. Since current ceramics processing presents strong limitations in shape and extremely complex design for manufacturing (more than 100 steps), industrially fabricated SOFC cells and stacks are expensive and present low flexibility and long time to market. This is particularly relevant for the commercial segment of the stationary fuel cells market (5-400kW) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of the overall power and heat requirements and requires customization of the final product.

The main goal of the Cell3Ditor project is to develop a 3D printing technology for the industrial production of SOFC stacks by covering research and innovation in all the stages of the industrial value chain (inks formulation, 3D printer development, ceramics consolidation and system integration). All-ceramic joint-free SOFC stacks with embedded fluidics and current collection will be fabricated in a two-step process (single-step printing and sintering) to reduce in energy, materials and assembly costs while simplifying the design for manufacturing and time to market.  

Compared to traditional ceramic processing, the Cell3Ditor manufacturing process presents a significantly shorter time to market (from years to months) and a cost reduction estimated in 63% with an initial investment below one third of an equivalent conventional manufacturing plant (production of 1000 units per year).

Introducing an adequate interface layer between the glass and the silicon film and applying laser crystallization by scanning over thin amorphous or nano-crystalline silicon thin films on glass has been shown to yield high-quality poly-Si films for solar cells. These films on glass present also high potential for other electronic devices like e.g. flat panel displays. In photovoltaic (PV) application this technology could result in significant silicon material savings and therefore cost reduction of PV modules in the near future. In the electronic industry it could give new possibilities to fabricate highly integrated electronic circuits on large area. In the frame of this project the investigation and optimization of the laser crystallization process and the design of the interface layer either for low cost soda-lime float glass or ultra-thin high temperature glass will be a focus. Solar cells and mini modules will be fabricated with the aim to develop on the one hand a process technology for large area monolithic integrated poly-Si thin film modules and on the other hand low cost wafer equivalents for back contacted solar cells which on the long-term can achieve efficiencies of multi-crystalline wafer cells.

The actual fossil fuels sources cannot assure the future energetic consumption. Studying new methodologies to exploit renewable energetic sources is therefore of utmost importance. The solar energy will have a crucial role in the energetic solution since it is the renewable source with the highest energy reaching the Earth crust. 

The scientific aim of this action, R2R-3G, is to increase the efficiency-cost ratio of photovoltaic technology. For this purpose, this project plans to exploit both the high efficiency of third generation (3G) solar cells, and the low cost fabrication methods based on roll-to-roll (R2R) processes. Part of the innovation of R2R-3G project lies in a methodological approach that makes compatible the flexibility of the devices required for roll-to-roll processes with the up-scaling of nanowire solar cells.

This scenario has imposed urgent needs to develop fossil fuel alternatives like solar fuels. In order to produce solar fuels, the coupled reduction of CO2 and H2O is one of the most promising processes.  However, the generation of efficient, stable and low-cost material for CO2/H2O reduction remains a big challenge. Silicon carbide nanowires (SiC NW) exhibit the unique properties of large surface-to-volume ratio, tuneable transport properties and quantum size effects, which is very promising for the reduction of CO2/H2O to produce solar fuels.  To date, the studies on SiC NW for CO2/H2O reduction are limited due to the lack of (1) large-scale production techniques, (2) in situ characterization of the growth mode, and (3) there are no economical devices available for the evaluation of SiC NW. This project, SOLARFUELS, proposes the engineering of SiC NW for solar fuels production through the development of a carbon nanotube template method for large-scale synthesis of SiC NW combing with in situ characterization of SiC NW during growth and post-mortem. Design of an economically viable device is envisaged to exploit the in house generated SiC NWs. By introducing novel multiple sample holders for atmospheric gaseous reaction, the designed device can enable efficient catalyst/reactant contact along the vertically orientation of SiC NW and reduce the cost for the device by at least a half.The SOLARFUELS is built across research areas of materials science, chemistry, chemical and device engineering.

Monocrystalline silicon (c-Si), the dominant technology on the photovoltaic (PV) market, benefits from a strong industry and record power conversion efficiency of 25%, with a cost decreasing every year. However, c-Si technology, mainly limited by material properties, has very little room for efficiency improvement. Much higher efficiencies has been achieved by stacking diodes made of III-V semiconductors; but for cost and availability reasons, the III-V solar cells are restricted to specific markets (space & terrestrial concentration). A hybrid solution combining the advantages III-V multi-junction cells with the benefits of Si, the most wide-spread PV material, offers great opportunities. Indeed, efficiencies up to 35% under 1-sun AM1.5G conditions is expected for a triple junction device based on conventional c-Si cells combined with additional (Al)GaAs and GaInP pn-junctions (4 Âµm of III-V material on top of a c-Si wafer). However the direct epitaxial growth of (Al)GaAs & GaInP on Si is highly mismatched and sufficient material quality has not been achieved so far. The innovative approach proposed in this project bypass the mismatch and enables to combine high crystal quality III-V compounds with Si through wafer bonding: III-V layers are grown lattice matched on GaAs or Ge and then bonded to Si, followed by substrate lift-off & re-use. The validity of the approach has been proven at Fraunhofer ISE with un-optimized GaInP/GaAs//Si triple-junction solar cells with >25% efficiency. This research project, relying on modeling and experimental work to optimize the cell structure (light trapping, bond interface quality, current matching, etc.), targets the significant breakthrough of a GaInP/GaAs//Si triple junction reaching >30% efficiency on large areas (>4cm2).",2015-06-01,2017-05-31,159460.8,,"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",2,3

It addresses three types of recalcitrant raw materials: lignocellulosic residues from ethanol production, lignins dissolved during pulping process and lignin-like humins formed by sugars conversion. Enzymatic and process engineering will be implemented to design efficient conversion routes and permit technological breakthroughs. A transversal platform for the characterisation of biomolecules will be settled to identify bio-products of commercial interest among lignins and humins multifunctional nanoparticles, phenolic antioxidants, insects-based chitosans and aromatic chemical intermediates.

The targeted biofuels are ethanol, butanol, furanics and biogas. The project will achieve a breakthrough in biofuel production from macroalgae by:

â€¢ Increasing the biomass supply by developing a rotating crop scheme for cultivation of seaweed, using native, highly productive brown, red and green seaweeds. Combined with the use of advanced textile substrates these breakthroughs will result in a year round biomass yield of 25 kg seaweeds (wet weight) per m2 per year harvested at 1000m2/hr;
â€¢ Improving the pre-treatment and storage of seaweed and to yield fermentable and convertible sugars at economically relevant concentrations (10-30%);
â€¢ Increasing the bio-ethanol production to economically viable concentrations of > 4%/l and;
â€¢ Increasing the bio-butanol yield to 15 g./l by developing novel fermenting organisms which metabolize all sugars at 90% efficiency for ethanol and butanol;
â€¢ Increasing the biogas yield to convert 90% of the available carbon in the residues by adapting the organisms to seaweed;
â€¢ Developing the thermochemical conversion of sugars to fuels from the mg. scale to the kg. scale;
â€¢ Performing an integral techno-economic, sustainability and risk assessment of the entire seaweed to biofuel chain.

MacroFuels will develop technology for the production of fuels which are suitable as liquid fuels or precursor thereof for the heavy transport sector as well as potentially for the aviation sector. The technology will be taken from TRL3 to TRL 4/5.

MacroFuels will expand the biomass available for the production of advanced biofuels. Seaweed does not need fresh water, arable land or fertilizers to grow, which provides environmental benefits, and in addition has a high carbon dioxide reduction potential as well as reduces the demand for natural resources on land. The technology offers many novel opportunities for employment along the entire value chain.",2016-01-01,2019-12-31,5999892.5,['Storage'],['biofuel'],2,3

The general applicability will be guaranteed by the following measures:
- Applying self-learning control techniques instead of model-based control approaches, will make the controller easy to implement in different configuration and generations of DHC networks.
- Three control strategies are included in the controller (peak shaving, market interaction, cell balancing). Dependent of the network, one or more of these strategies can be activated.
- The controller will be an add-on to many existing DHC network controllers and SCADA systems.

To present this general applicability, the controller will be demonstrated in two existing grids: one highly innovative low-temperature DHC network In the Netherlands and a more common medium-temperature district heating grid in Sweden.

Since additional value is created by applying the control strategies in the controller, innovative business models should be developed to distribute this value amongst the different market players (producers, transporters, consumers of energy). This will also be addressed in the project.

Also a plan will be developed on how the developed controller can be replicated to other countries than the ones of the demonstrators, taking into account different market organizations and legal framework.

With respect to dissemination two levels of dissemination will be applied. A international dissemination will address the international research community, DHN network controller suppliers, international energy companies etcâ€¦ Besides that, an additional local level will  be implemented where two local dissemination platforms will be installed integrating all local stakeholders (the energy company, users, local educational institutions, local politiciansâ€¦).

787,633962,P4SB,P4SB â€“ From Plastic waste to Plastic value using Pseudomonas putida Synthetic Biology,"P4SB is about the utilization of the conceptual and material tools of contemporary Synthetic Biology to bring about the sustainable and environmentally friendly bioconversion of oil-based plastic waste into fully biodegradable counterparts by means of deeply engineered, whole-cell bacterial catalysts. These tools will be used to design tailor-made enzymes for the bio-depolymerization of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PU (polyurethane), but also for the custom design of a Pseudomonas putida Cell Factory capable of metabolizing the resulting monomers. Pseudomonas putida will undergo deep metabolic surgery to channel these diverse substrates efficiently into the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and derivatives. In addition, synthetic downstream processing modules based on the programmed non-lytic secretion of PHA will facilitate the release and recovery of the bioplastic from the bacterial biomass.

These industry driven objectives will help to address the market need for novel routes to valorise the gigantic plastic waste streams in the European Union and beyond, with direct opportunities for SME partners of P4SB spanning the entire value chain from plastic waste via Synthetic Biology to biodegradable plastic. As a result we anticipate a completely biobased process reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste by establishing it as a novel bulk second generation carbon source for industrial biotechnology, while at the same time opening new opportunities for the European plastic recycling industry and helping to achieve the ambitious recycling targets set by the European Union for 2020.",2015-04-01,2019-03-31,7056968.5,,"['recycling', 'bioplastic']",2,3

We trace the knowledge from understanding to modelling and application, and follow a clear dissemination strategy by training and teaching, publications in scientific journals and by involving forest related stakeholders and the public. The project builds upon a consortium that was successfully established within the Marie Curie IRSES project Climate-Fit Forests. Here, the consortium is enlarged by complementary academic and non-academic partners, and the exploratory focus is extended. The study area encompasses a broad range of climatic zones from Mediterranean to sub-boreal areas providing highly different growing conditions and landscapes differently affected by climate change. By this multilevel and multidisciplinary approach we overcome the restrictions concerning the transferability of locally and case study focused results. We plan a rather high number of secondments in order to efficiently extend the interdisciplinary network and dissemination. The project connects countries where both, integrative and segregative approaches, are prevailing in forest management. The forest types of interest include pure and mixed stands as well as complex structured close to nature forests. We track climate induced impacts on carbon sequestration on cell, organ, and tree level up to stand and landscape level. For a broad spectrum of forest types and management approaches we measure and compile information about carbon sink and source, model the carbon balance, take into account economics and derive carbon smart forest management options under climate",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,967500.0,,"['carbon sequestration', 'forest management']",2,3
789,753156,SAFS,Development of screw anchors for floating Marine Renewable Energy system arrays incorporating anchor sharing,"Classical anchoring solutions are inappropriate for the development of new marine renewable energy devices (wind/waves/tides). They are too expensive and not efficient. Organising devices in arrays is a solution where adjacent devices share an anchor. It reduces the total number of anchors necessary and the overall cost. In turn the loading applied to an anchor is a complex combination of horizontal and uplift cyclic loads. Screw anchors are piles which are fitted with one or several helices at their end. They are installed into the soil by applying a torque and are assumed to have an excellent resistance against uplifting.
The objective of this work is to study the fundamental behaviour of screw anchors upon complex loading in sand. A unique database of physical modelling tests (using cutting edge centrifuge apparatus) representative of small arrays of devices will be developed. In particular the tests will assess their uplift capacity after low level cyclic loading (fatigue behaviour). Numerical simulations, validated against experimental results, will provide additional information. Finally a new design methodology taking into account multi-directional and fatigue loading will be derived. This comprehensive topic has never been investigated before in sand.
The University of Dundee offers cutting edge centrifuge facilities and has an outstanding experience in physical modelling. A designed experimental set-up is able to install screw piles in flight and apply a multi-directional loading. I will build on my strong background in numerical modelling to carry out the numerical part of the project.
EU targets the ambitious objective to derive 20% of its electricity production from renewable sources by 2020. The energy revolution has just started and should generate many jobs and investments in Europe. This project will clear technical and economical hurdles associated with anchoring.

791,845185,AlgCoustics,Single-step disentanglement and fractionation of microalgal high-value products through acoustophoresis,"Next generation biomass resources such as marine seaweed and micro-algae have advantages in comparison to terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass as they can grow on non-arable land at higher areal productivities. Aquatic biomass can provide renewable energy (e.g. biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas) as well as high-value molecules such as carotenoids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and food fibres, which can be used in food, feed, cosmetics, biomaterials, nanostructures and pharmaceutical industries. However, in order to greatly increase the economic viability of aquatic biomass, all components found in the biomass need to be valorized. Unfortunately, valorization of multiple biomass components is not possible using current/conventional biorefinery technologies, where up to 90% of the biomass is being treated as a waste. The value of these broken-down compounds sees more than a ten-fold reduction, rendering the biorefinery economically unfeasible. Therefore, in furtherance of developing multiproduct biorefineries, selective and economically feasible extraction and separation technologies will need to be developed and implemented. Significant microalgal cell disruption and extraction advances have been recently made by employing external fields such as lasers, ultrasonic waves and microwaves, in combination with less aggressive solvents and ionic liquids. However, the issues regarding the use of chemicals and multiple separation stages remain. Thus, we are proposing a game-changing single-step disentanglement and separation of microalgal high-value components by using acoustic waves at different frequencies allowing thus a complete process fine-tuning and eliminating the need for chemicals. Moreover, by including our previously-developed ultrasound disruption technology, the whole cell breakdown, extraction and separation steps could be reduced to one single process governed and finely-tuned through the employed frequency ranges.",2020-01-06,2022-01-05,187572.48,,"['renewable energy', 'biorefinery']",2,3

Lepido is based on three revolutionary Swedish patents and offers an average energy savings of 150,000 kWh â€“ the equivalent of saving 15 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.

Today, there is no effective heat recovery unit for commercial kitchens and the energy is simply released straight into the air without recycling. Unlike recycling heat from ventilation air in offices or apartment buildings, one of the greatest problems in restaurant ventilation is the aggressive environment (grease, pollution, moisture, soot, etc.) which destroys heat recovery equipment like cross-flow, rotating or battery units over time. 

Enjay begins a major transformation in the industry by changing the way of thinking about energy management in restaurant ventilation. With Lepido, Enjay opens up for energy recovery in a segment of the ventilation industry where it hasnâ€™t been possible until now.

795,647224,SIZE,Size matters: scaling principles for the prediction of the ecological footprint of biofuels,"There is a major scientific and societal challenge in quantifying and reducing ecological footprints of products. Ecological footprint calculations suffer severely from a limited availability of data, such as the amount of energy and materials associated with the production, use and disposal of products. Furthermore, ecological footprints pertaining to biodiversity are typically biased towards a limited number of well-known species with a focus on relative species richness, leaving out ecosystem service attributes of biodiversity. As it is virtually impossible to collect all the empirical data required for all species, there is an urgent need to develop an operational framework to derive representative ecological footprints with limited data requirements. I propose to develop a novel framework based on a set of unifying scaling principles related to the production size of products and the body size of species. These scaling principles will be developed to predict key characteristics of biofuel production, such as energy return of investment, agricultural land requirements and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as global impact indicators, such as species extinction risks. The focus of the research is on (1) liquid biofuel production (bioethanol and biodiesel) from various first and second generation feedstock as an important but controversial renewable energy source (2) vascular plant diversity, as the common basis of all terrestrial ecosystems, and (3) habitat destruction and climate change, as important drivers of global change.

The focus of the project is on building construction and process industries (from architects to raw material suppliers). 
The BAMB-project implements the principles of the waste hierarchy: the prevention of waste, its reuse and recycling. Key is to improve the value of materials used in buildings for recovery. This is achieved by developing and integrating two complementary value adding frameworks, (1) materials passports and (2) reversible building design. These frameworks will be able to change conventional (cradle-to-grave) building design, so that buildings can be transformed to new functions (extending their life span) or disassembled to building components or material feedstock that can be upcycled in new constructions (using materials passports). This way, continuous loops of materials are created while large amounts of waste will be prevented. 
Activities from research to market introduction are planned. Fundamental knowledge gaps should be bridged in order to introduce both frameworks on the market.

804,744311,ECOXY,"Bio-based recyclable, reshapable and repairable (3R) fibre-reinforced EpOXY composites for automotive and construction sectors.","Fibre reinforced thermoset composites (FRTCs) are attractive materials for high demanding sectors, such as automotive or construction, due to their lightweight and excellent mechanical properties. However, the lack of reprocessability and difficulty for repairing and recycling significantly increases the overall material cost and causes grave environmental concerns. Additionally, the vast majority of polymer matrices and fibres used in their manufacturing are non-renewable fossil-derived materials or require high amounts of energy for their production. 
Aiming at addressing those limitations by involving the European bio-based industry, ECOXY will develop innovative bio-based epoxy resins and fibre reinforcements to produce new sustainable and techno-economically competitive FRTCs by targeting advanced functionalities: reparability, reprocessability and recyclability (3R). The 3R functionalities will be achieved by using new resin formulations replacing commonly used curing agents by dynamic hardeners, which under certain operational makes possible to: 1) repair fibre/matrix delamination and matrix micro-cracks, 2) reprocess cured laminates could be reprocessed to create new 3D parts (impossible with traditional FRTCs), 3) mechanical and chemical recycling.
Thus, ECOXY will develop: 1) tailor-made bio-based epoxy monomers (including biorefinery products), 2) upgraded and functional bio-based fibres (natural and PLA), 3) specific formulations for FRTCs manufacturing processes (RTM, wet compression moulding and pultrusion) and 4) additional functionalities such as flame-retardancy for 3R resin and self healing for fibres.
The selected prototypes will be validated for automotive and construction sectors using relevant standards and applicable certifications. Besides, an environmental (LCA) and socio-economic assessment of the results will be carried out. 
The well balanced composition of the consortium, 6 SME, 6 RTO and 1 academia gives ECOXY the maximum chance of succ",2017-06-01,2020-11-30,4850960.0,,"['biorefinery', 'recycling']",2,3

Its flexibility is derived from the long-term collaboration of key industrial partners with research organisations, having in mind the large variety of EU buildings, especially non-residential (types, uses and sizes).
The overall objective is to develop a configuration based on renewables that allows covering all heating and cooling demand and a variable electricity demand (from zero up to even 100%) in a cost-effective manner. This configuration is based on solar, ambient and bioenergy, while it is suitable to be installed in various buildings types and sizes without any geographical restriction. The main technologies included have already proven their performance and they are combined with the aim to exploit all possible energy flows/sources, ensuring their cost-effectiveness compared to standard solutions.
The SolBio-Rev concept is based on solar thermal collectors with vacuum tubes combined with thermoelectrics, a cascade thermal chiller with electrical-driven heat pump for very high performance under cooling operation even at extreme hot conditions, a reversible heat pump/ORC for enhancing flexibility and switching operating modes between summer and winter, exploiting all available solar heat, and an advanced biomass boiler coupled with the above ORC for CHP operation. A smart control is also envisaged to manage and optimise the system operation with user-friendly features. The project also includes dissemination and communication activities to ensure outreach of its results, as well as an active participation of end-users and installers in the technology development.

In this project, the applicant aims to employ novel all-inorganic charge transport layers to fabricate high efficiency and stable inverted planar perovskite solar cells (power conversion efficiency > 23%), based on a functionalized charge transport layer- a Lanthanum(La)-doped BaSnO3(LBSO)/graphene bi-layer. LBSO has a cubic perovskite structure which provides an opportunity to further improve the quality of the interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite film in conjugation with atmosphere annealing process, which we term â€œLBSO-template induced perovskite re-nucleation and crystal growthâ€. A compact conductive graphene layer inserted between the LBSO layer and the metal contact can act as a spacer layer to block the mobile ion and moisture penetration. That will not only improve the device stability (maintain initial efficiency > 90% after 1000 h illumination), but also give a chance to reveal the device degradation mechanism in depth.deeply.",2019-08-01,2021-07-31,224933.76,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,3

But the further deployment has been hindered in Europe since 2013 due to the retroactive changes in the investment conditions in Spain. To unlock this situation, the EC has launched in 2015 a dedicated Initiative â€“ Initiative for Global Leadership in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). This Initiative, focusing on 2 targets (a cost reduction target and an innovation target), was adopted in 2016 within the SET-Plan structures. A working group gathering representatives from several SET-Plan countries and the STE stakeholders from both industry and research sectors was set up to define a corresponding Implementation Plan (IP), which was officially adopted in June 2017, including 12 R&D action line and the implementation of new innovative, so-called First-Of-A-Kind (FOAK) plants.

Due to the increasing population and scarce usable space on land, there is an increasing need for sustainable food and renewable energy from the ocean. In the future these will be supplied more and more by fish- and seaweed farms and ocean energy(floating) wind turbines. There are also geographical locations where additional housing or logistic hubs are needed. All these developments need a flexible and scalable concept that can support a multitude of activities at sea.
Space@Sea consists of a group of companies, research institutes and universities that will develop a modular concept for multi-use platforms. Standardised floaters that can be produced at low cost will form the basis. The approach will reduce the cost through standardisation in a similar way that containers reduced the cost of transport in the past.
Each floater can support a different function, such as: housing, renewable energy hub, aquafarming (seaweed, algae and fish farms) and logistics equipment. By combining the applications in different ways, Space@Sea will form islands according to the specifications for the location and function at hand. Three specific islands will be validated and demonstrated as part of Space@Sea: An energy hub in the North Sea, aquaculture in the Mediterranean and a floating logistics hub in the Black Sea.

The FLEDGED project will combine a flexible sorption enhanced gasification (SEG) process and a novel sorption enhanced DME synthesis (SEDMES) process to produce DME from biomass with an efficient and low cost process.

The primary aim of FLEDGED project is to develop a highly intensified and flexible process for DME production from biomass and validate it in industrially relevant environments. This objective will be accomplished by:
 - Experimental validation of the flexible SEG process at TRL5;
 - Experimental validation of the flexible SEDMES process at TRL5;
 - Evaluation of the full biofuel production chain from energy, environmental, economic, socio-economic and risk point of view;
 - Preparation of the ground for future exploitation of the results of the project beyond FLEDGED, by including in the consortium industrial partners along the whole biofuel production chain.

 - is characterized by a tremendous process intensification: sorption of CO2 in the gasifier and of water in the DME reactor allows designing an overall process for DME production with only two fundamental steps and with reduced units for syngas conditioning
 - allows operating with a wide range of biomass feedstocks
 - will be more efficient than competitive processes and expected to have a lower cost, thanks to the reduced number of components, the avoidance or significant reduction of recycles and the avoidance of energy consuming and costly air separation and CO2 separation units

814,636069,OMICON,Organic Mixed Ion and Electron Conductors for High-Energy Batteries,"Energy storage is undeniably amongst the greatest societal challenges. Batteries will be key enablers but require major progress. Battery materials that promise a step-change in energy density compared with current Li-ion batteries rely on fundamentally different reactions to store charge, e.g. Si alloying or O2 reduction instead of intercalation. They have in common high volume changes on cycling and poor conductivity. For the active component of a battery electrode to function it must be simultaneously in contact with ionic and electronic pathways to electrolyte and current collector. State-of-the-art conducting additives and binders in the composite electrodes cannot ensure ideal contact for such materials and fail to exploit their full potential.

In this project I directly target these fundamental challenges of high-energy batteries by replacing now used conducting additives and binders with flexible organic mixed ion and electron conductors that follow volume changes to ensure at any stage intimate contact with ions and electrons. This requires progress with the fundamental science of such conductors, for which to achieve we develop and combine synthetic, electroanalytic and spectroscopic methods, aided by theory. Mixed conducting polymer gels, designed for the particular storage material, shall be elaborated for two ultra-high capacity electrodes, the O2 cathode and the Si anode.

The significant advantage, next to intimate contact, is that the packing density of active material can be maximized. This boosts energy stored by total electrode mass and volume by rigorously cutting the amount of non-active materials compared with current approaches. The expected overriding scientific impact includes improved understanding of mixed conductors concerning synthesis, structure, conductivity and their behaviour in the complex battery environment. This opens up new perspectives for the realm of high-capacity battery materials that demand such a breakthrough to succeed.",2015-04-01,2020-03-31,1494253.75,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,3

817,827525,DG Island Mode,Deep Green Island Mode,"15 million Europeans live on Europeâ€™s 2,400 inhabited islands, at an average of approximately 1,500 households per island. As recognised by the European Commission, island energy is expensive, polluting, inefficient and dependent on external supply, with significant negative impacts on emissions, the competitiveness of businesses, and the economy. 

Assuming that just 65% of these islandsâ€™ electricity comes from diesel, we estimate that they produce approximately 17.5 million tonnes of CO2 every year. This is further increased when considering isolated coastal communities. Existing renewable alternatives are often unsuitable for these communities, such as wind and solar power, as the energy they generate is unpredictable and intermittent, making it difficult to rely on. They also have a large land footprint and high CAPEX costs. Tidal energy is also often unsuitable, as it requires fast tidal flows (over 2.5m/s) which only occur in a few specific hot spots around the World. The technology is also expensive, with both high CAPEX and OPEX costs. 

The Deep Green Island Mode (DG Island Mode) is a stand-alone tidal and ocean current energy converter for off-grid applications. The DG Island Mode is the concept of flying an underwater kite, that when steered in an 8-shaped trajectory, generates a speed of 8-10 times the speed of the actual current. This generates the following unique performance characteristics: 
- Generates cost effective electricity in tidal flows as low as 1.3 m/s 
- Generates up to 100kW, producing an estimated 0.35 GWh/year, enough to power 100 homes; 
- Can be located close to the shore; 
- Up to 15 times lighter per kW compared to other tidal energy solutions - Easy, low cost installation and maintenance (low CAPEX and OPEX costs); 
- Cost of energy 50% lower than diesel generators DG Island Mode offers cheap, clean, reliable electricity generation to island communities.",2018-08-01,2018-11-30,50000.0,['Wind'],['tidal energy'],2,3

Current materials, transferred from oil and gas applications to these exceptionally harsh environments, (and the corresponding design models) are not capable of performing, leading to constant need to inspect and repair damage.  The Geo-coat project will develop new resistant materials in the form of high performance coatings of novel targeted 'High Entropy Alloys' and Cermets, thermally applied to the key specified vulnerable process stages (components in turbines, valves, pumps, heat exchangers and pipe bends) in response to the specific corrosion and erosion forces we find at each point.  We will also capture the underlying principles of the material resistance, to proactively design the equipment for performance while minimising overall capex costs from these expensive materials. 

The Geo-coat consortium has user members from geothermal plant operations and equipment manufacture to ensure the project's focus on real-world issues, coupled with world-leading experience in the development of materials, protective coatings and their application to harsh environments.

The reactions at both anode and cathode of PMFCs can be catalysed by microbial biofilms capable of oxidising organic matter (anode) and catalysing oxygen reduction (ORR) (cathode) producing electrical power from renewable resources. However, PMFC power output to date remains low and often unpredictable due to the variability in activity achieved by the electrodes microbial biofilms. Their selection in both anode and cathode is a fundamental requirement to enhance catalytic activity and produce higher power densities. This proposal aims at developing a conceptually new approach towards PMFC catalysis though the introduction of novel nanocomposite carbon electrodes that will combine intrinsic and microbially-mediated catalytic activity. These functional materials will integrate moieties that promote bacterial recruitment to select suitable microbial consortia onto carbon based electrodes for both anodic and cathodic reactions. In the case of the cathode, the carbon material will be selected by using electrochemical methods ex situ (voltammetry) in simulated aqueous environment in the presence of fertilizers and soil to also display ORR catalytic activity. Anode and cathode topography will be investigated to identify nanostructures that promote biofilm colonisation and to control density and stability of active sites.

Therefore, the development of next generation efficient energy storage devices which is light, flexible, aesthetic diversity, and small units with shape-conformability, and excellent mechanical properties, with high energy and power characteristics becomes highly important. However, compared to conventional SCs, research on flexible fiber supercapacitors FSCs are still in its infancy due to their high cost, low energy density, low capacitance, poor flexibility, safety problems, toxicity and scarcity of some nanomaterials, and poor cycling stability, which continuously force us to search for alternative sustainable and high-performance electrode materials. In this respect, clearer coalitions between the lignin-derived carbon fiber composite (CFC) electrode material properties such as fiber thickness and modulated structure, porosity, functionality, effect of dopant, and electrochemical performance during capacitive studies such as capacitance, solid electrolyte interface, columbic efficiency, energy density, cyclability are needed. Notably, we sought to introduce new biodegradable gel electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, pore structures, modulated thickness, will prepare by a facile, green, nontoxic, and cost effective.

The project includes technical aspects (such as substrate flexibility, biomass liquefaction and hydro-pyrolysis in molten salts and subsequent hydro-deoxygenation and their integration), but also a socio- and techno-economic viability study of the technology (substrate availability and supply chain, future end-users and economic sustainability of the process). This will ensure the future deployment of this new technology considering its social related issues, such as acceptance or modification of the perception of transport induced by such sustainable fuels. Such a holistic approach considering the full value chain, combined to communication with stakeholders during the course of the project, will provide valuable input for scale up and industry-oriented research after this project, maximizing the impact, amongst other in the biomass, biofuel and transport industry.
To reach its objectives, the project covers the whole value chain, from feedstock supplier to end-users (knowledge users (RUG, UG, AU, NMBU, DLR), technology users (BTG, Innventia), and middle distillates users (through DLR)), as well as an entity dedicated to SSH aspects (CIRPA).",2018-04-01,2022-03-31,3998025.5,['Fuel'],['biofuel'],2,3

Despite its useful side, herbicides are well known at the present to be enormously pollutant for soils and watercourses as well as crops. Nowadays, innovation on the field of undesired weeds removal is based on the search of less harmful methods as mechanical rotary herbicides or rotary cultivators that, at the same time, present some disadvantages: due to the discs shape they provoke compaction of the soil underneath causing floods and dewatering of lowers layers, as well as present a lot of resistance when moving due to their disc shape and materials, moved thanks to the engine power transmission shaft in a very slow and inefficiently way, provoking a big waste of fuel and associated GHG emissions. CAVALLERETTI, and Italian company from Ferrara, has invented a revolutionary system based on a patented and long-lasting cultivator discs, rollers cut and general design performing an efficient cultivation of the soil for planting bedding. LICE cultivator allows a fast work increasing the speed four times (from 5 kmts. to 20) saving the 30% of fuel, therefore decreasing the level of GHG emissions and saving money, preventing floods and avoiding the use of chemical herbicides and fertilisers as it turns the removed and chopped weeds in organic compost. LICE is expected to bring to the company in the 5 ys. after full commercialization a total accumulated turnover of â‚¬28M, with a profit of â‚¬8,7M, a R.O.I. of 4,8 and a positive impact regarding employment with 26 job creation.

In contrast to electric and fossil fuel fired heaters, pellet stoves offer renewable heating for single rooms or low energy houses. However, while pellet stoves typically achieve low pollutant emissions during pre-commercial testing, these emissions often surpass certification limits when users operate them at home. Current solutions involve installation of extra filters that can double the investment costs of the entire heating system.
RIKA, European market leader in wood stoves, aims at a significant extension of its product portfolio by the final development and commercialization of cleanFIRE. It constitutes a milestone in pellet-based space heating because it enables for the first time an almost zero CO, OGC and PM emission free combustion without the application of extra dust filters. cleanFIREâ€™s controlled transformation of the pellets into combustible gas forms its innovation core (as verified by tests performed using its gasifier and burner prototypes). In this project the new technology shall be further optimised in order to pass type testing at project end. Leveraging on EU climate targets, our innovation and current market consolidation with other pellet and logwood stoves, we will start cleanFIREâ€™s commercialization in 2022 targeting homeowners looking for 1) the replacement of an oil/gas/coal-fuelled or oversized heating appliance, and 2) those aiming to buy a new space heating appliance. We will initially enter the market across Austria, and through our well-established network of importers and retailers across Germany, France, Italy, Sweden and selected Eastern and Southern European countries.

825,832606,PISCO,Photochromic Solar Cells: Towards Photovoltaic Devices with Variable and Self-Adaptable Optical Transmission,"Solar Solar energy is an unlimited renewable source of energy but its contribution to European energy production is still minor. It is therefore urgent to develop innovative photovoltaic (PV) technologies and products, and to implement them massively. Among emerging photovoltaics, Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are competitive in terms of efficiency, cost, and more importantly stability. They can be made semi-transparent which is an appealing feature for building or automobile integrated photovoltaics. But to be efficient, they have to harvest a maximum of photons from the sun, thus the best-performing DSSCs cannot show a good transparency which impedes their use as windows. 
In 2017, I proposed a new concept to combine photochromism and photovoltaic, leading for the first time to efficient semi-transparent solar cells showing variable and self-adjustable optical transmission. These cells can simultaneously adapt their absorption depending on the weather conditions and produce electricity. 
Starting from this result, PISCO will widely explore this exciting concept and provide a breakthrough in photovoltaics by developing a novel class of multifunctional solar cells that could be massively integrated in buildings, automotive, or mobile electronics.
The main objectives of PISCO are:
1) Design and synthesis of novel photochromic dyes with optimized optoelectronic properties and high stability. 
2) Integration of these molecules in devices using methodologies to enable fundamental studies, to fully understand what factors are governing the photochromic behaviour, the generation of electrical power, and the interplay between them. 
3) Inspired by the most relevant and recent concepts in the field, to develop robust and efficient photochromic solar cells and modules.

Manufacturing these optoelectronic devices at a large scale involves concerns at technological, economical, ecological, social and political levels. Ideally, the new materials are abundant, easily processed and feature long term stability and non-toxicity. The advent of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). e.g., MoS2 and WS2, has generated great expectations since these materials fulfill all these requirements. 2D-TMDCs exhibit direct band gaps, high absorption coefficients, and high carrier mobility values, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. The out-of-plane quantum confinement responsible for the direct bandgap in the monolayer, also allows for the modulation of the bandgap as a function of the number of layers. However, for photovoltaics (PV), even if transparency is an important attribute in some niche markets, e.g. building-integrated PV, thickness-limited absorption poses a challenge in general. To overcome this issue, we propose a photonic nanostructuration to maximize light harvesting in these devices. We will combine strong interference effects based in the small penetration in a metallic substrate and the light trapping due to the nanostructuration by lithography of TMDCs over a metallic substrate. Resonators with high-quality factors will have potential applications in light harvesting devices, such as photodetectors, but also in solar cells. We will design and fabricate such an efficient photodetector, and also a solar cell incorporating the photonic design, and demonstrate enhanced performance in a metal back reflector/TMDC/graphene device.",2020-03-16,2022-03-15,159815.04,,"['solar cell', 'PV']",2,3

Such materials are highly desirable for many rotating and airborne engineering applications but often suffer from prohibitive brittleness, particularly in fatigue. The project applies a combination of nanoscale strain mapping techniques recently developed by the host institution, and by Dr. Edwards, on novel in-situ meso- and micro-mechanical fatigue testing setups, to study deformation behaviour upon fatigue loading. Currently, the European hub plays a central role in the research and development of advanced gamma titanium aluminide alloys, such as for improved processability, and the large-scale production of Î³-TiAl components. However, no significant improvements have been made to the fatigue properties of the lightweight Î³-TiAl alloys in the past few decades, effectively limiting their widespread application in higher volume industries where they could result in considerable increases in fuel efficiency. Similarly, Mg aluminides, such as the Î³-Mg17Al12 phase, possess outstanding strength to weight properties; given sufficient improvements to their toughness and fatigue performance, they would be excellent candidates for structural components in future, more ecologically friendly, aero-propulsion technologies where the operational temperatures are lower than gas turbine engines (e.g. electric and hybrid-electric). This project is closely aligned with EU policy on climate action and sustainable development as it targets reduced emissions through reduced hydrocarbon fuel consumption; its success will serve to increase the European confidence and knowledge-base in these material systems and, through further interaction with European industry, the extent of their use.",2020-09-01,2022-08-31,191149.44,['Fuel'],['gas turbine'],2,3

Two of the most severe limiting factors of using solar power are the inconsistency of the power output, due to the day/night cycle and weather conditions, and the transportation issues due to geographical location. Solar fuels, produced by combining concentrated solar power with thermochemical processes, are a promising concept to overcome both limitations. These fuels, acting as chemical energy carriers, can be generated at suitable sites and easily transported worldwide, where they can be stored and used. Current methods for solar fuel generation are based on a 2-step reduction-oxidation cycle, with each step at different pressure and temperature, thus creating technological difficulties. Moreover, the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of the best process is less than 6%. The goal of this research is to develop a novel method for solar thermochemical splitting of CO2 and H2O, achieving high conversion efficiency. To do so, a unique approach utilizing the use of Ceria membranes will be investigated. The research will include rigorous modelling of the physics, followed by a detailed characterization and optimization, providing a solid understanding of the overall process for the first time. In addition, a novel configuration for the solar reactor will be developed, with steady-state operation and heat recovery, a challenging feat requiring innovative design capable of operating at 1600Â°C.

For that purpose, an innovative laboratory device will be developed and pilot-tested allowing for dry and saturated rocks measurements of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity at pressures and temperatures that are simultaneously raised to values up to 200 MPa and 200Â°C, respectively. These are the conditions for depths (to approx. 7 km), which are of interest in the use of Earth resources (such as geothermal energy, hydro-carbons, storage of energy or waste).

These energy sources cause voltage instabilities in the power grid as they inject uncontrolled power in various locations along the power grid. This instability issue is the main obstacle that holds back further penetration of renewable energy in to the power grid.
Existing methods of real time voltage control in the distribution network are both expensive and have relatively low performance and include replacing already installed distribution transformers with newer transformers. 
We suggest the application of an add-on unit that enhances existing and already-installed distribution transformers, for real-time voltage control with similar efficiency, cost and reliability as conventional transformer. The application of a large number of real time voltage controlled transformers in the power grid will result in reduced losses in the power grid and increased stability in face of distributed generation. Moreover, it will allow for adoption of a much higher percentage of renewables.

ARM Holdings (the world's leading semiconductor IP supplier) predict that the IoT will begin to free itself from battery power in 2018.  Without reducing the reliance on battery power, there is a significant roadblock in reaching trillions of devices. Future devices will need to be self-sufficient and operate without any battery swaps or any human intervention for decades. This will be made possible through harvesting of all the available ambient energy in the environment, for example:
Thermal energy associated with static and dynamic temperature differences;
Vibration energy e.g. from vehicles driving over a bridge or oil following through a pipe;
Light energy from indoor artificial lighting. 
For these predictions to be realised, the current roadblock is micro energy harvesting systems that can effectively capture all available energy using just one energy management device. The technical challenge is that these ambient energy sources have widely different electrical characteristics that must be managed e.g: photovoltaic and thermoelectric harvesters are low-voltage DC, resistive, â€œtrickleâ€ sources; electrodynamic harvesters are high-voltage, inductive, â€œpulsedâ€ sources whilst piezoelectric harvesters are high-voltage AC, capacitive, â€œburstyâ€ sources.

These attractive properties arise from the electrostatic nature of the charge storage which results from ion adsorption in the electrode pores. Recently, it was demonstrated that ions can enter pores of sub-nanometer sizes leading to a huge increase of capacitance. This was an important breakthrough as the energy density of supercapacitors, relatively low compared to batteries, is what currently limits their application. 
The progress towards more powerful supercapacitors is limited by our incomplete understanding of the relation between their performance, in particular their capacitance and charging rate, and the complex structure of the porous carbon electrodes. To make progress we need a better fundamental understanding of the ion transport and electrolyte structure in the pores but we are lacking the experimental and theoretical methods to do so. 
The aim of SuPERPORES is to carry out a systematic multi-scale simulation study of supercapacitors. The use of combined molecular and mesoscopic simulations will allow us to calculate the capacitive and transport properties of a wide range of systems. Molecular simulations will be used to model ordered three-dimensional porous carbons. This will allow us to vary geometric descriptors, e.g. pore size and ion size, in a systematic way and obtain relevant microscopic information for the subsequent computational screening of porous carbons, achieved through very efficient lattice simulations. We will then be able to formulate design principles for a new, and much improved, generation of supercapacitors.

In the pursuit of these nearly zero-energy buildings, innovative solutions to embed renewable energy supply on the building are sought after. The use of solar panels on large faÃ§adeâ€™s area is not yet a plausible solution since, with current technologies, it would result in dark closed buildings, while residents and workers seek glass facades to enjoy daylight. 
The Lumiduct is an innovative solution to generate renewable energy via the faÃ§ade without having to compromise on transparency and design: a sun shading system made of transparent solar panels integrated into the building faÃ§ade. The Lumiduct is the next step in making buildings energy-neutral.
During the day, the Lumiductâ€™s transparent solar panels automatically follow the position of the sun and at the same time filter the sunlight, converting the direct, blinding sunlight into energy, but letting diffuse, soft daylight through. During the night, an advanced version integrating LEDs makes it possible to create a beautiful atmosphere and communicate with the community. The Lumiduct creates awareness and makes living in and around the building a great experience.
The added value for the indoor climate is remarkable. Compared to a conventional automated sun shading system, the first results show that the Lumiduct system saves 24% on heating every year, 40% on cooling and 36% on lighting. Lumiduct has become a reality, having reached the pilot scale for the first time in a facade of 40 mÂ² at an office building in the Netherlands.

The latter are placed at the forefront of the EU efforts for low-cost production and efficient consumption of electricity, a critical issue for a sustainable development.
In this context, the use of biomolecules as functional components in lighting and photovoltaic devices is still a challenge, as they quickly denature under storage and device operation conditions. This paradigm has changed using an innovative rubber-like material, in which the biofunctionality is long preserved. As a proof-of-concept, color down-converting rubbers based on fluorescent proteins were used to design the first biohybrid white light-emitting diode (bio-HWLED). To develop a new generation of biohybrid devices, InOutBioLight will address the following critical issues, namely i) the nature of the protein-matrix stabilization, ii) how to enhance the thermal/mechanical features, iii) how to design multifunctional rubbers, iv) how to mimic natural patterns for light-guiding, and v) how to expand the technological use of the rubber approach.
To achieve these goals, InOutBioLight involves comprehensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and mechanical studies to investigate the protein-matrix interaction using new polymer matrices, additives, and protein-based nanoparticles. In addition, the mechanical, thermal, and light-coupling features will be enhanced using structural biocompounds and reproducing biomorphic patterns. As such, InOutBioLight offers three major advances: i) a thorough scientific basis for the rubber approach, ii) a significant thrust of the emerging bio-HWLEDs, and iii) innovative breakthroughs beyond state-of-the-art biohybrid solar cells.",2019-09-01,2024-08-31,1999188.0,['Storage'],['photovoltaic'],2,3

PYROTECH is four to ten times cheaper than other pyrolysis systems. It will generate more than 6,5 million euros of additional income for European coffee companies and will eliminate more than 18.000 tonnes of C02 emissions in the first three years due to the carbon sequestration potential of coffee husk used and biochar produced. Currently, more than 9,5 million tonnes of green coffee beans are processed annually, from which 4,8 million tonnes are produced using the dry method. Taking into account the market size, market distribution and current interest of our potential clients, PYROTECH will cover after five years of commercialization, 18% of the total amount of pyrolysis machines needed to dry the coffee cherries.

843,836459,DigiBreakers,Putting Digital Circuit Breakers at the Centre of the Smart Grid,"Problem
The integration of more renewable energy into the grid, creating highly variable, unpredictable and distributed energy production, uneven load and peak demand and transmission losses create significant challenges for utilities to effectively guarantee energy supply. 
Despite the investing billions of euros in Smart Meters, it is clear they are not the solution. They only collect limited amounts of data for the utility, do not give households greater control of their energy use, and cannot implement demand side management. 

Solution â€“ Bl!xt DigiBreaker
DigiBreaker turns your fuse box into a smartphone, collecting and communicating rich, real time electricity usage data as it passes through the circuit breaker. All the time while maintaining the core function of a circuit breaker, which is to interrupt current flow when there is a fault in the system. DigiBreaker breaks 1000 times faster and is more secure than the mechanical devices.
DigiBreaker offers the following functionality:
â€¢	Enables remote demand side management for the utility.
â€¢	Direct two-way communication between the utility and the household.
â€¢	An integrated controller that measures and collects detailed energy usage. 
â€¢	Can be controlled remotely via smart phone or computer. 

Project
The aim of the phase 1 project is to improve our understanding of the value DigiBreaker holds for our target customer and clearly map out the route to market. In phase 2 we envisage to scale up the technology, establish a strategy for compliance in Europe, run pilots with utilities and build a commercial and operational strategic plan to demonstrate these aspects to utilities on a large scale. 

Impact & Market
We estimate that DigiBreakers could replace traditional circuit breakers and fuses, which will have an estimated market size of over 27 billion â‚¬ by 2020. Reaching 5% of this market by 2025 would provide us with returns of over 60Mâ‚¬ and an IRR of 81%.",2019-01-01,2019-04-30,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'demand side management']",2,3
844,651505,Direct Drive TT,Feasibility study for an innovative direct drive tidal turbine,"Nova Innovation is a leading designer and manufacturer of tidal turbines. We have designed, built, deployed and are currently operating a grid-connected turbine in Scotland. In this project we will conduct a feasibility study into the market potential for our direct-drive tidal turbine design.

One way to reduce the cost and increase the reliability of tidal turbines is to find innovative ways to utilise the benefits of the subsea environment by using seawater to lubricate and cool the turbine drive train. Another is to reduce the number of offshore components by eliminating the gearbox to produce a direct-drive turbine. These steps reduce or eliminate the need for expensive and failure-prone equipment such as high pressure shaft seals, watertight bulkheads and cooling systems. This reduces operational costs and increases device reliability and yield. 

No company to date has developed a direct drive tidal turbine that is reliable and economically viable. Our design is innovative in the particular combination of drive train, blade and support structure design, which is optimised to minimise the lifetime cost of the integrated system.

Potential customers are tidal energy project developers seeking to generate predictable, reliable energy from the tides at minimum lifetime cost. The market for tidal power is global, but Europe is taking a lead with potential clients in the UK, France and Ireland. Once proven in Europe the technology can be exported worldwide, with a potential global market of 800 TWh per annum (IEA-OES), or annual electricity sales of over â‚¬40 billion.

In Phase 1 we will conduct a feasibility study including a detailed IP review and strategy development, supply chain and market study and risk assessment to reinforce our business plan for exploiting this invention. In Phase 2 we will conduct a full-scale demonstration of the technology in a real-world setting: Nova Innovationâ€™s existing, permitted, in-sea, grid-connected tidal energy site.",2014-10-01,2015-03-31,50000.0,,"['tidal energy', 'tidal power']",2,3

This enables retrofitting in houses with old, high temperature radiators, while achieving a Seasonal COP (SCOP) of over 130%. The solution can easily be combined with solar thermal collectors to achieve a SCOP of up to 170%.

Working already with major OEMs like GE and Alfa Laval in other applications, ClimateWell is targeting the European gas boiler OEMs such as Vaillant, BDR and Ariston to develop a Gas Heat Pump (GHP) product in which ClimateWellâ€™s HeatBoost component is integrated.

It potentially saves more than 33% of the natural gas consumption (500 EUR per year) for a typical European household using a condensing gas boiler today. The cost premium can be paid off in less than 4 years, making it an attractive investment for the end-user.

While the target market for domestic space heating in Europe is huge with an installed base of 90 million boilers and over 8 million sold every year, the potential environmental impact is even bigger with a total reduction of CO2 footprint of 61.5 million tonnes/year.

In this 6-month Feasibility Study, ClimateWell will verify the technical and commercial feasibility of integrating ClimateWellâ€™s new sorption component into a gas boiler system. The goal is to establish collaboration with leading European boiler manufacturers for the continued development of a GHP product and apply for funding of a Phase 2 project.
A successful outcome of the project means that once the GHP product has been commercialised in 3-5 years, ClimateWellâ€™s potential revenue for providing some 2 million HeatBoost components per year to boiler manufacturers is 1 billion EUR.",2014-10-01,2015-03-31,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'heat pump']",2,3
847,652101,Aeropaft,Delay of flow separation and stall on Aerofoils using a Passive Flow control Technology which will improve aerodynamic performance and stability of wind turbines increasing their range of operation,"Flow separation and dynamic stalling in aerofoils result in increased drag, reduced lift and increased dynamic loads on aerodynamic devices/vehicles. This culminates in reduced aerodynamic efficiency and increased structural vibrations, which are noisy and reduce the operating life of aerodynamic devices. To delay flow separations and dynamic stalling, flow control is engaged either actively (artificial means) or passively (natural means). This project describes a novel passive flow control method (Aeropaft) to be applied primarily in the wind turbine (WT) industry, then to aircraft and ground and marine vehicles.
Wind energy is the fastest growing Renewable Energy source (RES) at 24.4% per year. To keep pace with growing demand, there is need for advanced technologies to increase the aerodynamic efficiency. Aeropaft is a simple technology exploiting high velocity currents from near the leading edge (via internal ducts) to re-energise the free-stream flow at the top of an aerofoil. This results in a 5% increase in electrical power yield for a 1MW WT, increase in lift (~16%), reduction of profile drag force (~7%) at higher aerofoil angles of incidences (>12o), and the reduction of wear caused by vibrations. We will penetrate 1% of the global WT market and 10% of the European market. Licensed Manufacturers stand to gain a 0.33% increase in market value and revenue of â‚¬1.72bn, while utility companies gain â‚¬101,013 per annum through savings and increased energy output per WT. Our revenue will come through licensing at 0.2% of the whole turbine cost translating to revenue of â‚¬10.3m and profits of â‚¬7.72m, five years post commercialization.
Phase 1 will entail a market study, partner search, assessing structural integrity issues and developing an IP and commercialisation strategy.

Solar energy can lead a â€œparadigm shiftâ€ in the energy sector with a new low-cost, efficient, and stable technology (3-pillars strategy). Nowadays, low-cost three dimensional (3D) Hybrid Perovskites (HP) solar cells are revolutionizing the photovoltaic scene, with stunning power conversion efficiency beyond 22%. However, poor device stability (due to degradation in contact with water) and dependence on toxic components (lead) substantially hamper their commercialization. 
HY-NANO aims to realize a new low-cost and efficient hybrid solar technology combining long-term stability with a reduced environmental impact. Design and engineering innovative multi-dimensional hybrid interfaces is the core idea. This will be achieved by: 1. design and characterization of new stable and eco-friendly perovskites structures, with tunable composition and dimensionality ranging from 3D to 2D; 2. exploiting new synergistic functions by combining 3D and 2D perovskites together into novel stable and efficient multi-dimensional interfaces while addressing the interface physics therein; 3. integrating the hybrid interfaces into high efficient and stable device architectures engineered â€œad hocâ€. In addition, I propose the development of new solar cell encapsulant using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) functionalized as selective lead receptors to minimize the environmental risks associated with the potential release of lead. 
My multidisciplinary expertise in advanced material design, cutting-edge photophysical experimental investigations, and solar cell engineering will enable me to successfully target the ambitious goals.

849,835381,UECGA2,Use of Ethanol Containing Gasoline in Aviation,"Majority of piston engine powered General Aviation aircraft are running on aviation gasoline (Avgas) grades that are more expensive than Ethanol containing gasoline grades used by automobiles. In addition, most of the piston aero engines are still burning lead containing Avgas (100LL). No certified solution is available to allow operation of aircraft engines with Ethanol containing, EN 228 Standard fuel grade.
Consequently, the project aims to result in certified modifications of the common piston aero engines and small aircraft that allow use of Ethanol containing gasoline. It will reduce fuel cost (30-40%) for small aircraft, while it will not require replacement of old engines. Yet, it will involve replacement of some parts and changes to operational procedures leading to an economical solution. The project will also allow eliminating lead containing Avgas and introducing renewable energy using Ethanol. This will reduce greenhouse gas emission, combating climate change and contributing to environmental protection.
Introduction of Ethanol containing gasoline for aviation triggers safety risks that should be mitigated to reach an acceptable level of safety to gain certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA. Certification may be achieved if it is demonstrated that the modifications comply with the airworthiness requirements and will not lead to unsafe condition.
Technical feasibility will be verified through the analysis of the safety risks as well as the determination of the applicable airworthiness requirements and means of compliances, by means of the certification programmes accepted by EASA. Commercial feasibility will be shown through market research and analysis.

Thus, technologically smart and economically viable solutions for extending the lifetime of energy infrastructure will be in high demand. Incorporating more distributed RES and storage assets at the edges of the electricity grid, and optimally balancing these assets with other energy vectors, while extending the lifetime of current infrastructures will not only be economically viable, but at the same time decrease the level of carbonisation in local energy systems.

Nature offers high performance membranes relying on a parallel local regulation of nanopore structure, functional placement, membrane composition and architecture. Existing technological membranes are key materials in separation, recycling, sensing, energy conversion, being essential components for a sustainable future. But their performance is far away from their natural counterparts. One reason for this performance gap is the lack of 3D nanolocal control in membrane design. This applies to each individual nanopore but as well to the membrane architecture. This proposal aims to implement 3D printing (additive manufacturing, top down) and complex near-field and total internal reflection (TIR) high resolution microscopy induced polymer writing (bottom up) to nanolocally control in hierarchical nanoporous membranes spatially and independent of each other: porosity, pore functionalization, membrane architecture, composition. This disruptive technology platform will make accessible to date unachieved, highly accurate asymmetric nanopores and multifunctional, hierarchical membrane architecture/ composition and thus highly selective, directed, transport with tuneable rates. 3D-FNPWriting will demonstrate this for the increasing class of metal nanoparticle/ salt pollutants aiming for tuneable, selective, directed transport based monitoring and recycling instead of size-based filtration, accumulation into sewerage and distribution into nature. Specifically, the potential of this disruptive technology with respect to transport design will be demonstrated for a) a 3D-printed in-situ functionalized nanoporous fiber architecture and b) a printed, nanolocally near-field and TIR-microscopy polymer functionalized membrane representing a thin separation layer.

Asoluna, a Swedish SME that designs and manufactures solar energy solutions, has design and prototyped Prisma: a multifunctional solar thermal collector for integration in the building envelope in such forms as facades, decorative elements, parapets, glazing etc. It acts as a climate envelope that efficiently protects the building from unwanted heating or cooling, while at the same time delivering solar heating to the buildingâ€™s systems. Crucially, it has been designed in collaboration with some of Europeâ€™s leading sustainability architects to be easy to retrofit on to existing buildings.

A key question in this context is whether schemes to maintain or increase carbon stocks through forest management actually co-benefit biodiversity. Although frequently promoted, assumptions about such co-benefits have not been rigorously assessed. Forest and CO will test whether policies designed to protect either biodiversity or carbon in Europeâ€™s temperate forests are synergistic or conflicting. Three work packages (WP) will focus on both unmanaged, old-growth forests, representing a baseline for key ecosystem functions, and managed forest, constituting the majority of Europeâ€™s forests. WP1 will build a network of forest researchers to gather existing data on old-growth forests in Europe, and create the first map of their distribution. WP2 will use plot-level data to model the relationship between forest biodiversity and carbon storage, and assess whether this relationship differs between old-growth and managed forests. WP3 will test whether carbon/biodiversity co-benefits vary, when scaled up to broader extents, using satellite products and vegetation-plot databases. This action will provide new insight into the synergies and trade-offs between carbon and biodiversity in temperate forests and develop methods to map these trade-offs.

In this project, we propose to combine the advantages of two important nanoscale materials, semiconductor quantum dots (QD) and two-dimensional atomic layered (2-D) materials, to realize high-efficiency hybrid solar cells. Quantum dots are one of the best absorbing and carrier photogenerators due to multiple exciton generation and their size-tunable and direct band gap, however, their poor dot-to-dot conductivity has been a major limitation for photovoltaic devices. We propose to overcome this limitation by intercalating 2-D materials that have shown high charge mobility and strong optoelectronic properties. We propose a tandem configuration based on a stack of QD layers for strong carrier photogeneration, with intercalated 2-D atomic layers for efficient charge and photocurrent extraction. We will study the charge transfer and separation at the interface of QDs and 2-D layers, both of which are strongly affected by quantum confinement. The co-supervisors of this project, Prof. Konstantatos and Prof. Koppens at ICFO, have demonstrated a QD/2-D(graphene) phototransistor with a photoresponse up to 5 orders of magnitude higher than phototransistors based on single graphene or MoS2 atomic layers without QDs, showing the potential of QD/2-D hybrid devices for photovoltaics. In addition to QDs, we will also use small band gap materials, such as phosphorene and other 2-D semiconductors that can harvest energy from infrared hot sources in dark conditions.

Upon a negative potential applied on the functionalized graphite electrode, H\ cations from protic ionic liquid electrolyte will be inserted into graphite interlayers and be reduced to hydrogen gas to further open the edge of graphite, which will facilitate the larger imidazolium cations to intercalate, expand and completely exfoliate graphite to single layer graphene.

859,751375,TinPSC,Towards Stable and Highly Efficient Tin-based Perovskite Solar Cells,"Developing new energy sources is an urgent issue, as fossil fuels will be exhausted in near future. Solar cells system is a promising renewable energy technology that converts sunlight to electricity. Today, crystalline silicon exhibits high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) and dominates the solar panel industry. The problem of silicon solar cells is that it suffers from high production cost due to tedious processing condition. Recently, organic-lead-halide perovskites have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar cell devices, and the PCE is up to 22.6% over the past few years. In spite of high efficiency, the presence of toxic lead (Pb) will become problematic in the future for widespread deployment of this technology. It is prospective to replace Pb with less toxic tin (Sn). However, the poor stability (the easily oxidization of Sn2\ to Sn4\ by O2) and low efficiency are two major issues of Sn-based perovskites. This proposal targets air-stable, high efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells by developing new Sn-based perovskites and electron transporting layer to match the band energy of perovskites. The expected fruits of the project will contribute to European excellence and competiveness in renewable energy field. The successful transfer of the results will promote economic growth and job supplies.

In this project, the effects of contaminants, originating from the hydrogen supply chain, on the fuel cell systems in automotive applications are studied. As an outcome, recommendations for the current ISO 14687 standards will be formulated based on the technical data of the impurity concentrations at the HRS, FC contaminant studies under relevant automotive operation conditions, and inter-compared gas analysis.

The methodology for determining the effect of contaminants in automotive PEMFC system operation will be developed by six leading European research institutes in co-operation with JRC and international partners. In addition, a methodology for in-line monitoring of hydrogen quality at the HRS, as well as sampling strategy and methodology for new impurities, gas, particles and liquids, will be evolved.

Three European laboratories will be established, capable of measuring all of the contaminants according to ISO 14687 standards, and provide a strong evidence on the quality and reliability on their result. Beyond the project, the three laboratories will offer their services to the European FCH community. In addition, a network of expert laboratories will be set, able to provide qualitative analysis and the first analytical evidence on the presence or absence of these new compounds with potential negative effect to the FCEV.

One solution lies in the advancement of a hydrogen economy, however for this to play a key role, sustainable approaches to producing H2 from renewable energy is required. A promising method for localised H2 production is the direct conversion of solar energy to fuel. Photochemical molecular devices that combine a light-harvesting unit, a bridging ligand and a catalytic center offer considerable opportunities and indeed bimetallic systems have been reported based on such combinations as Re/Co, Ru/Pt, Os/Rh, Ru/Rh, Pt/Co and Ir/Rh. During this research programme the Research Fellow will develop multicomponent arrays based on Ir/Fe and Ir/Co assemblies, and focus on the underlying mechanisms leading to solar hydrogen generation in these catalysts, and investigate structure-activity relationships. The research conducted at DCU (Pryce group) will be complemented by two secondments at Groningen (Browne group), and also to the industrial catalysis partner Catexel.

To develop efficient photochemical molecular devices for visible light-driven hydrogen production, a thorough understanding of the photophysical and chemical processes in the photocatalyst is of vital importance. Therefore, to probe the photochemical reaction dynamics, the Fellow will gain experience in time resolved techniques spanning the pico to milli-second time frame, time correlated single photon counting, luminescence, and through secondments (resonance) Raman spectroscopy, TR2 and ns-TR3. During in the secondment to the Netherlands the Fellow will spend a period at Catexel where he will be introduced to the steps in product development and IP management.

863,780004,NANOPORE,Precise array of proton selective nanopores in 2D atomically thin membranes,"Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are devices expected to power future micro and portable electronic devices as well as vehicles. The lack of efficient proton exchange membranes, however, still prevents the development and application of DMFCs. Of paramount importance is ion selectivity and fast transmembrane transport, for which nanoporous two-dimensional membranes offer the prospect of enhanced fuel cell performance. Several chemical and physical limitations have so far prohibited the wide usage of atomically thin nanopores membranes, most particularly because the process of nanopore formation still lacks a reproducible, scalable and industrially viable fabrication approach. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and finally commercialize such a membrane with precise array of functional nanopores. In this proposal, based on the knowledge and experience resulting from our ERC project [project no. 335879], we will employ a novel two steps approach based on organic and supramolecular chemistry to synthesize atomically thin proton exchange membrane bearing a chemically well-defined array of nanopores and we will control the functionality of the nanopore rim by using specific chemical modifications on the backbones of monomers used to form the high selectivity proton exchange membrane (PEM). If the testing and technical reports are successful, the resulting PEM will be used in DMFC field and other related area, such as desalination and osmosis electricity generation.

We strongly believe that this proposal will open a new direction for breaking through the dilemma of the nanopore formation, developing new generation proton selective membranes, as well as promoting the research and applications of DMFC.

IonPEFC will bring together the chemistry of nanostructure and ionic liquid (IL) synthesis with the engineering of fuel cells to develop PEFC electrodes with thin film catalyst nonstructures from PtNi nanowire arrays modified by protic ILs, targeting an improved understanding of structure-property relationships of electrodes to build high performance and robust PEFC devices.

865,739775,CRNPE,Chemical Recycling for the New Plastic Economy,"Global production for plastic has grown to over 300Mt/year and rising. However, only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling, and plastic packaging with an economic value of â‚¬70-110 billion is lost annually to the economy after just a short use. The vast majority of plastic is still disposed of by incineration or landfill, with in excess of 8Mt leaking into the oceans each year. It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. 

Recycling Technologies Ltd. has developed a process that recycles end-of-life mixed plastic waste [MPW] into a commercially valuable hydrocarbon called Plaxx. The technology is capable of processing varied types of MPW. Plaxx produced by the process can be used as a substitute for Heavy Fuel Oil but with the advantage of being very low sulphur.

However, rigid food containers and items such as drinks cartons etc., use laminates of differing polymers. The widespread use of dyes, fillers and other additives, alongside contamination from the contents of the original packaging, presents challenges for our process. Currently, our process is designed to process MPW with low levels of contamination. Capability to process a higher level of contamination through our process opens up markets 2-3 times bigger than at present. Therefore the aim of this project is to further develop the gas filtration system of the technology, and the recruitment of an Associate with the level of expertise to realise this innovation opportunity is therefore essential. During the project, the Associate will research on widely used gas filtration technologies and recommend the ones which are suitable and scalable for our process.

868,655170,IILSCFLP,The Influence of Ionic Liquid Solvation on the Chemistry of Frustrated Lewis Pairs,"Hydrogen (H2) is an important reagent for the chemical industry as well as representing a promising carbon-free fuel source when made from renewable sources. H2 needs to be activated for these applications, generally using rare, expensive and often toxic transition metal catalysts. Metal-free H2 activation has recently been demonstrated using the concept of â€˜frustrated Lewis pairsâ€™ (FLPs) based on main group elements such as phosphorous and boron rather than transition metals. FLPs are somewhat limited in scope due to the highly reactive Lewis acids (LAs) and bases (LBs) required for H2 activation which can lead to side reactions with substrates and solvents. The use of less reactive FLPs is restricted by the H2 activation step. This project addresses this problem by using the unique solvating ability of ionic liquids (ILs) to control the reactivity of FLPs for H2 activation. Many FLPs form ions when they react with H2. To promote H2 activation, it is essential that the reverse reaction (ion recombination to form H2) is prevented. The high ion dissociation power of ILs should prevent the recombination of these ions, leading to more efficient H2 activation. The impact of ILs on H2 activation by FLPs will be investigated in the context of synthesis and fuel cell applications. Successful use of ILs for this purpose would substantially increase the scope of FLP catalysts, reducing the reliance on transition metals thereby decreasing the potential cost and environmental impact of H2 activation processes. This project would represent the first study on the effect of ILs on FLP reactivity and combines the collective expertise of Prof. Welton (ILs) and Dr Ashley (FLPs) at Imperial College (IC) with the applicantâ€™s background in ILs, kinetics and intermolecular interactions, while providing the applicant with productive collaborative partners and advanced training in catalysis, electrochemistry, IL and FLP chemistry to propel him towards an independent research career.",2015-10-01,2017-09-30,195454.8,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,3

This technology has the potential to revolutionize plastic recycling across Europe and funding will help us bring it to market
quicker.

Developed to meet the needs of the recyclers, the process involves a low capital and operational expenditure, which opens the equipment to small and medium sized recyclers across Europe, allowing them to separate plastics which are currently classed as too expensive to separate. This adds value to the recycler, and provides manufacturers a rich source of useable recycled material at a local level. Our technology has the potential to make a major change in the way plastics are recycled across Europe.

Soltiles proprietary technology minimises power generating costs for the property owners whilst improving aesthetics of the buildings. Soltilesâ€™ initiative is a tile installed onto roofs like a standard roofing tile. Installation can be undertaken by any roofing contractor. The integrated solar slate is unique by incorporating both crystalline and thin film technology. The thin polymer composite membranes improve flexibility and versatility of the substrate, while the PV cells used have 20\% efficiency. The technology has been experimentally validated and the soltiles have been proven to yield more than 90% of the absorbed energy from the PV cell. Soltiles targets the residential and re-roofing markets to promote the development of Net Zero Energy Homes.
The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy and to plan all activities for deploying a pilot production line of 5000 soltiles to serve the in-field installation of about 200 roofs in the EU.",2015-07-01,2015-10-31,50000.0,,['PV'],1,3

Over 40m tonnes of multilayered plastics are produced globally, per annum, of which the EU contributes 9.6m tonnes, with an expected growth of ~7%. 

However, due to the extreme difficulties in achieving effective seperation of the material into its constituent polymer components, multi-layered plastic waste is currently collected as a single waste stream & disposed of through landfill (at costs of â‚¬130 per tonne), or incinerated (~â‚¬80 per tonne). Thus, the future of multilayer packages is now a great environmental concern, with an urgent need to develop effective separation technology.

Our objective is to develop an ultrasonic assisted chemo-mechanical recycling method to separate multilayered plastic packaging waste (semi-rigid trays, cups, tubs & their film-based lids), currently deemed unrecyclable, and recover polyethylene (PE) & polyethylene terepthalate (PET) individually in order to sell these end products in the EU recycling market & thereby create a new business opportunity of ~â‚¬4.8bn. Successful development of this technology will create the business opportunity to recycle this material, generating new revenues while reducing waste, landfill, energy & saving ~14.4m tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum. Our novel process will not only ensure the sustainable supply of these plastics as raw materials via environmentally friendly recycling but will also provide participating SMEs with the opportunity to derive an ongoing income. 

It is envisaged that the potential benefits of the LAMPACK technology would be:
â€¢	Annual value for recovered PET per plant of â‚¬3.5m
â€¢	Annual value for recovered PE per plant of â‚¬5.2m
â€¢	Energy savings of  â‚¬1.6m p.a per plant
â€¢	CO2 reduction of ~ 22,500tpa per plant",2016-10-01,2017-03-31,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,3

Nanomaterials and nanotechnology offer substantial possibilities for improving the competitive position of the EU and for responding to key societal challenges. However, there is a need to ensure the safe development and application of nanomaterial and nanotechnologies and for finding reliable ways to predict the potential risks to health, food and environment of these materials and technologies . Due to the widespread use of nanomaterials, it is critical to identify any potential risks they may pose to human health or the environment. These current uncertainties surrounding nanomaterial risk mean that research is required into nanomaterial safety. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help to ensure that innovation in the rapidly developing area of Nanotechnology is not stifled by concern, but instead by determining risks associated with nanomaterials we can promote the safe, sustainable and responsible use of this technology.

In recent publications, I introduced di-block copolymer stars (or telechelic star polymers - TSPs) as novel self-assembling building blocks (â€œsoft legosâ€), made of a soft core, decorated by a tunable number of functionalized regions or patches.

TSPs have a robust and flexible architecture and they possess the ability to self-assemble at different levels. At the single-molecule level, they first order as soft patchy colloids which serve then as â€œsoft Legoâ€ for the emergence of larger structures. At the supramolecular level of self-assembly, the soft colloids form complex crystal structures, such as for example diamond or cubic phases.

In this project I propose to investigate how such a novel class of highly versatile tunable building blocks can be applied to the self-assembly of novel and designable soft-materials and how to exploit their self- assembly properties for a controlled adsorption and release of nanomaterial into functionalised predetermined regions.

IIn contrast to many functionalised building blocks, telechelic star polymers particles are soft and they self-assemble into patchy structures, without the need for cumbersome synthesis techniques.â€¨The quantitative multiscale approach that will be used to carry out the theoretical part of this project, will allow a direct mapping to an experimental realization of the system.

The objective of this proposal is to investigate how to induce and control a tunable adsorption of nanomaterial within the intramolecular TSPâ€™s self-assembling process, and to use such particles to perform controllable delivery of nanomaterial into target functionalised regions.",2017-05-02,2019-05-31,168277.2,,['nanomaterial'],1,3

The material to be studied is BiFeO3 as the most promising photovoltaic ferroelectric material known. Does the photovoltaic effect in BiFeO3 occur at the domain walls or in the bulk? What does it take a domain-wall to conduct electrons? The project aims
at establishing the necessary conditions for electric fields and electrical conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls. Since experimental evidence is inconclusive, state-of-the-art ab initio methods will be applied. Electric fields have a long spatial range, so we will go beyond the standard supercell approach to obtain the spatial gradient of the band structure at the domain wall, needed to obtain charge-carrier distributions and electric fields. The Green's-function method for electronic quantum transport will be used for this purpose because it is suitable for extended, non-periodic systems. We will obtain the electrical conductivity as a function of the domain-wall type, structure, and purity. Conclusions for the role of the domain walls in BiFeO3 will be generalized as far as possible in order to apply them to other ferroelectric semiconductors as well.

The applicant will receive training in state-of-the-art electronic-transport calculations by the host. In turn, the applicant will strengthen the hostâ€™s activities in the field of modelling optical properties of semiconductors.

The project is positioned where fundamental condensed-matter physics meets applied solar-cell research. It is expected to advance the frontier of knowledge in basic research and to lay the ground for further research on ferroelectric photovoltaics.

The air traffic controller is the main player in the traffic management at tactical level. This project aims at providing the air traffic controller with more automated tools, thus freeing capacity for situations where human intervention is crucial. This provides even safer service for an increasing amount of traffic and with lower costs, as required by airspace users.
This project is a part of the SESAR programme and addresses separation management. It will not only improve current conflict detection tools, but also develop new tools aiding the air traffic controller with resolution advisory and monitoring of flight trajectory. 
The project also addresses new ways of working together.  Air traffic controllers traditionally work in pairs and in specific airspace. Could we change this to multi-planner setup, sector less airspace and seamless cross-border operations? Our project will ensure the research is developed to a stage where it can be used in operational air traffic management systems in Europe.

But oncogenic PVs are actually an unfortunate exception, as most PVs cause asymptomatic infections, and a few cause benign, wart-like lesions. Despite the efforts directed towards the understanding of the different clinical manifestations of infection, our knowledge on PV evolution remains fragmentary.
Oncogenic human PVs arose recently, after acquiring the E5, E6 and E7 genes. The integration of the E5 proto-oncogene in the ancestral AlphaPV genome allowed viruses to evade host immune response. Thereafter E6 and E7 acquired the ability to target essential tumor suppressor proteins, paving the way for carcinogenesis. Tracking the evolutionary history of the E5, E6 and E7 oncogenes will thus help understand the emergence of oncogenic human PVs. Regarding the deep roots of PVs, small DNA viruses may share a common ancestor as they encode proteins sharing similar functions and domains, but their evolutionary origin is still an enigma.
Here I propose to apply an evolutionary medicine approach, combining in silico and wet-lab approaches, to study key events that occurred during PV genome evolution. We will go back into history and study how and when certain PVs became oncogenic. We will resurrect the ancestral oncogenes, and experimentally test hypotheses about the function of the resurrected proteins in different environmental contexts. We will then generate a comprehensive scenario modelling the appearance of the modern PV genome and the emergence of the oncogenic phenotype of certain PVs. Finally we will explore the relationships between small DNA viruses and test whether they may have a common origin.

Printed electronics allows for the direct printing of a range of functional (conductive, resistive, capacitive and semi-conducting) nanomaterials formulations to enable a simpler, more cost-effective, high performance and high volume processing in comparison to traditional printed circuit board and semiconductor manufacturing techniques. It has been reported by Frost and Sullivan  that the market for printed electronics will increase in revenues from $0.53Bn in 2010 to $5.04 Bn in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate of 32.5%. 
However, the migration towards low-cost, liquid-based, high resolution deposition and patterning using high throughput techniques, such as inkjet printing, requires that suitable functional nanomaterials formulations (e.g. inks) are available for end users in industrially relevant quantities. Presently, there are issues with industrial supply of nanomaterials which are low cost, high performance, environmentally friendly and tailored for high throughput systems. Therefore better collaboration is warranted between supply chain partners to ensure nanomaterial production and nanomaterial formulations are tailored for end use applications to meet this need.

The same year, 53 million tons of waste PET is landfilled, incinerated or floats into seas and oceans. 
Gr3n proposes a completely new way to break this vicious circle and create plastic from waste.
The problem with PET is that it is currently â€œreusedâ€ and not â€œrecycledâ€, as only transparent and pale bottles are mechanically treated to be partly added to virgin PET in the production of plastic bottles and trays. All other PET derived products, as waste polyester textiles and coloured plastics are almost worthless to the market and end up polluting the environment.
Our vision is to enable the first truly circular approach to PET recycling, empowered by our patented technology able to break any kind of PET into its two main building blocks, for creating new PET plastics infinitely and cost-effectively.
Through a 15,000 tons/year gr3n plant we do expect to collect, process and address the need of virgin plastics and polyester of a metropolitan area, thus triggering a true circular approach to plastic recycling. The cPET project is focused on validating the sustainability of creating a European distributed network of gr3n plants localized in each urban area, able to treat any PET-derived waste and produce new plastic for local consumption.

The LANDMARK proposal builds on the concept that soils are a finite resource that provides a range of ecosystem services known as â€œsoil functionsâ€. Functions relating to agriculture include: primary productivity, water regulation & purification, carbon-sequestration & regulation, habitat for biodiversity and nutrient provision & cycling. Trade-offs between these functions may occur: for example, management aimed at maximising primary production may inadvertently affect the â€˜water purificationâ€™ or â€˜habitatâ€™ functions. This has led to conflicting management recommendations and policy initiatives. There is now an urgent need to develop a coherent scientific and practical framework for the sustainable management of soils.
LANDMARK will uniquely respond to the breadth of this challenge by delivering (through multi-actor development):
1. LOCAL SCALE: A toolkit for farmers with cost-effective, practical measures for sustainable (and context specific) soil management.
2. REGIONAL SCALE - A blueprint for a soil monitoring scheme, using harmonised indicators: this will facilitate the assessment of soil functions for different soil types and land-uses for all major EU climatic zones.
3. EU SCALE â€“ An assessment of EU policy instruments for incentivising sustainable land management.
There have been many individual research initiatives that either address the management & assessment of individual soil functions, or address multiple soil functions, but only at local scales.

The DryFiciency solution will be demonstrated under real production conditions in operational industrial drying processes in three leading European manufacturing companies from the pet food, food and brick industries. 
The potential of the technology demonstrated is to reduce the specific energy demand for drying and dehydration from 700-800 kWh per ton down to 200 kWh per ton of evaporated water. The energy switch from fossil fuels towards heat pump technology reduces the environmental impact considerably and offers at the same time a potential for energy savings of up to 60-80 %.

Conversely to other, slower nonlinear models, this novel model can facilitate effective design and optimisation of the device, enable real-time power optimisation and model-based control. The project will greatly impact the wave energy community, making a high-performance modelling tool easily accessible to any stakeholder for a variety of advanced design purposes. This project is comprised of 3 work packages, which accomplish: (1) validation of the model for axisymmetric devices, (2) expansion and validation of the model for pitching platform devices, and (3) enhancement of computation performance and release of an open-source software. In addition, this fellowship will expand the career horizons of the fellow: a highly multidisciplinary plan is defined, building upon and extending beyond his current competencies. The fellow is well-positioned to undertake this project, allowing him to fully develop innovative ideas from his PhD research. This fellowship will provide the fellow with an unparalleled opportunity to grow as a scientist and engineer, launching him on a trajectory to a productive and rewarding scientific career.",2019-05-01,2021-04-30,171473.28,,['wave energy'],1,3

To achieve this objective, M2DC will be built on three main pillars:

- [Pillar 1] A flexible server architecture that can be easily customised, maintained and updated so as to enable adaptation of the data centre. Open server architecture will enable integration of computing resources with constrained thermal power dissipation such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, manycore processors integrated using established standards such as COM Express.

Globally, GHs are concentrated in Asia and the Mediterranean Basin. Excluding China, the world GH coverage can be estimated in more than 450,000 hectares from which not less than 200,000 hectares are located in Europe, mainly in the Mediterranean Basin. However, European GHs are facing a challenge, due to a 40% reduction of food production subsidies in the last 40 years while non-European competitors with lower operational costs are increasing. RUFEPA and SUNBOOST are developing SUN4GREEN with the aim of delivering to GH farmers a dual revenue solution with integrated photovoltaics and crop harvesting to reduce energy costs while targeting high crop yields. This will turn GHs to a stable livelihood by generating a new and reliable electricity income stream in addition to their principal agriculture business. SUN4GREEN will also maximize land use and its productivity by integrating PV systems with GHs in the same land footprint. Greenhouse market is growing at a stable 10% CAGR. Within this market, Smart GH segment is the one presenting major growth, being positioned as a reliable option to increase crop production through LED lighting, HVAC and automatized irrigation systems among other high-tech equipment. In fact, Smart GH market is expected to reach more than â‚¬1,060 million with CAGR of 14.18% from 2015 to 2020, having Europe the largest market share among all regions. Furthermore significant number of PV installations have demonstrated its potential to drive economic growth in rural areas.

900,720715,InDIRECT,Direct and indirect biorefinery technologies for conversion of organic side-streams into multiple marketable products,"The aim of the proposal is to develop biorefinery processes as part of new value chains to convert under-spent side streams/residues from the agro-sector and processing sector into useful marketable products. Cascading processes (recovery of multiple compounds from the same feedstock) are envisioned to increase the conversion efficiency (product/ton biomass input) and maximise the values of the feedstock (euro/ton biomass input).  Direct biorefiney of the biomass will be compared with indirect biorefinery.  The latter refers to the two-step process that can cope with the heterogeneity of side-streams.  In a first step the heterogenic feedstock is converted to homogenous biomass.  The game-changing approach that will be applied is the use of insects in this step. Insects are able to convert a variety of feedstocks into a more homogenous biomass, being their own biomass.  In a second step, the insect biomass will be further fractionated into a lipid, protein and chitin fraction, that all three have potential to be converted into marketable end-products (step 3). The ability to use various feedstocks results in a more robust and scalable biorefinery process that is expected to be less dependent on the season.
The direct approach (without the insect convertion step) which will be explored for green leaves, is expected to be more seasonally variable, but generates a larger variety of compounds. The project foresees to process the derived fractions further into multiple marketable products for the feed, food and chemical sector. More than 20 new product formulations are envisioned and will be subjected to application tests within InDIRECT.  Activities from lab to pilot scale are foreseen, enabling the generation of sufficient material for application tests that are crucial for developing the downstream market.

In 2010, the European steel industry generated, as waste, about 21.8 Mt of steel slag. The 76 % of the slag was recycled in applications such as aggregates for construction or road materials, but these sectors were unable to absorb the total amount of produced slag. The remaining 24 % was landfilled (2.9 Mt) or self-stored (2.3 Mt). The landfilled slag represents a severe environmental problem. 
The main aim of RESLAG is to prove that there are industrial sectors able to make an effective use of the 2.9 Mt/y of landfilled slag, if properly supported by the right technologies. In making this prof, the RESLAG project will also prove that there are other very important environmental benefits coming from an â€œactiveâ€ use of the slag in industrial processes, as CO2 saving (up to 970 kt/y from CSP applications, at least 71 kg/ton of produced steel from heat recovery applications), and elimination of negative impacts associated with mining (from the recovery of valuable metals and from the production of ceramic materials).
To achieve this ambitious goal four large-scale demonstrations to recycle steel slag are considered: Extraction of non-ferrous high added metals; TES for heat recovery applications; TES to increase dispatchability of the CSP plant electricity; Production of innovative refractory ceramic compounds. 
Overall, the RESLAG project aims at an innovative organizational steel by-products management model able to reach high levels of resource and energy efficiency, which considers a cascade of upgrading processes and a life cycle perspective.
All these demonstrations will be lead by the industries involved in the RESLAG consortium. The RESLAG project is supported by the main organizations representing energy-intensive industries, CSP sector, energy platforms, governments, etc.",2015-09-01,2019-07-31,8022006.68,,['CSP'],1,3
902,646592,MAGnUM,A Multiscale and Multimodal Modelling Approach for Green Urban Traffic Management,"The MAGnUM project aims to (i) create a consistent set of interrelated dynamic and multimodal traffic models able to capture driver behaviours at the different urban scales and (ii) apply this variety of models to design efficient and green traffic management strategies.
Traffic flow dynamics is well reproduced at a local urban scale by the kinematic wave model and its numerous extensions. Even if this model is parsimonious compared to other modelling approaches, it can hardly be applied at larger urban scales for traffic control applications. Very recently, a new modelling approach has been proposed to represent congestion dynamics at large scales. It relates the total travel production to the vehicle accumulation in a traffic network with for now a restrictive condition about network homogeneity. This approach is very promising for designing new traffic management systems but heterogeneous situations should be handled by properly connecting with the local scale to account for the effects of the local distributions and variations of the driver behaviour (demand) and the network structure (supply). Investigating these relationships and proposing a full set of consistent models representing traffic dynamics at several relevant scales (successive spatial and temporal integration) is very challenging with high potential gains for traffic control applications. This is the primary goal of MAGnUM and will be achieved by mixing analytical investigations on idealized but insightful test cases with explanatory approaches based on data gained from dynamic simulations or serious game sessions on more realistic and complex cases.
The second goal of the project concerns the design of innovative traffic management strategies at multiple urban scales. Breakthroughs will be achieved by considering multiple and competitive objectives when optimizing with a tight focus on environment issues and multi-modality.",2015-09-01,2020-08-31,1975500.0,,['traffic management'],1,3
903,646436,RiCORE,Risk Based Consenting of Offshore Renewable Energy Projects,"The consenting of offshore renewable energy is often cited as one of the main non-technical barriers to the development of this sector. A significant aspect of this is the uncertainty inherent in the potential environmental impacts of novel technology. To ensure consents are compliant with EU and national legislation, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment and Habitats Directive, costly and time consuming surveys are required even for required even for perceived lower risk technologies in sites which may not be of highest environmental sensitivity. It is therefore the aim of the RiCORE project to establish a risk-based approach to consenting where the level of survey requirement is based on the environmental sensitivity of the site, the risk profile of the technology and the scale of the proposed project. RiCORE will study the legal framework in place in the partner Member States to ensure the framework developed will be applicable for roll out across these Member States and further afield.
 
The next stage of the RiCORE project is to consider the practices, methodologies and implementation of pre-consent surveys, post-consent and post-deployment monitoring. This will allow a feedback loop to inform the development of the risk-based framework for the environmental aspects of consent and provide best practice. The project will achieve these aims by engaging with the relevant stakeholders including the regulators, industry and EIA practitioners, through a series of expert workshops and developing their outcomes into guidance.
 
The impact of the project will be to improve, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy Directive specifically Article 13 (1), consenting processes to ensure cost efficient delivery of the necessary surveys, clear and transparent reasoning for work undertaken, improving knowledge sharing and reducing the non-technical barriers to the development of the Offshore Renewable Energy sector so it can deliver the clean, secure energy",2015-01-01,2016-06-30,1393532.5,,['renewable energy'],1,3

A holistic approach is proposed to produce cost-competitive biobutanol from 3 types of lignocellulosic biomass and waste in a sustainable way being flexible to accommodate regionally specific feedstocks.
Project exploitable outputs include:
(1)novel low CAPEX two-step pretreatment process that releases hemicellulose and cellulose from recalcitrant feedstocks for further enzymatic and/or fermentation processing,
(2)new tailored enzyme cocktail yielding highly fermentable sugars at low enzyme dosages and lower cost,
(3)superior clostridial strains with enhanced production characteristics i.e. butanol and inhibitor tolerance,
(4)high productivity fermentation process including a novel in-situ product recovery step. 
Technology advances allow sustainable feedstock diversification, improve conversion yields and efficiency, reduce energy requirements, and water usage. We expect significant reductions in cost (target $800/T which equates to 50% of current 1st gen solvent production in China) as well as enhanced energy balances and reduced GHG emissions vs 1st gen biofuel production (target a 85% reduction).
The project output (a technically and economically-validated process) will provide the EU with a tremendous opportunity to build an advanced biofuel business from sustainable feedstocks.

We will use non-thermal plasma, which has large potential to convert these small (low reactive) molecules under near ambient temperature and pressure, particularly for distributed processes based on renewable energy. The new processes have drastically lower carbon footprint (up to over 90% with respect to current ones). Furthermore, CO2 conversion is crucial for a world-based distribution of renewable energy. However, the selectivity and energy efficiency of plasma technologies for these reactions are too low, making radically new approaches necessary. 

The Project idea is to realize a highly innovative approach for non-thermal plasma symbiosis with catalysis. By inducing excited states in solid catalysts to work in synergy with the excited short-lived plasma species, we introduce a brand new idea for catalyst-plasma symbiosis. In addition, we introduce a fully new concept of nano-/micro-plasma array through a novel electrode design, to generate the plasma at the catalyst surface, thereby overcoming long distance transport. By embedding ferro-magnetic nano-domains in the catalyst support and inducing radiofrequency heating, we create fast temperature modulations directly at the catalyst active sites. Combining these elements, the project will overcome the actual limits and enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency to levels suitable for exploitation. This requires a synergy over different scale elements: nano at catalyst, micro at the level of modelling plasma generated species, milli at the reactor scale and mega at the plant level for sustainability-driven opportunity guidance and impact assessment by Life-Cycle-Assessment.

But only 31% of plastic packaging are currently recycled due to infra-developed technologies or to their unsatisfactory economic viability. This is in fact aggravated by considering plastics as commodity where their economic value is linked to a single use, often not taking into account the potentially generated end of life hurdles. In line with the just released Plastic Strategy for Europe, the time has come to stop the depletion, landfilling and incineration and shift to a Circular Model in the plastic sector improving the recycling rate but also the value of secondary raw materials from plastic recycling.

912,760642,NIRSort,"Development and Market Replication of novel NIR-transparent polymer colourants to replace carbon black, and allow the sorting of black and coloured polymers from mixed waste streams","Currently, around 25 million tonnes of plastic waste is created each year across Europe, primarily from three sources â€“ consumer packaging, WEEE disposal and vehicle dismantling. The requirements for sorting and segregation of polymer types within waste streams are intensifying - more stringent targets for recycling are forcing recyclers to segregate more difficult materials that they could formerly lose as scrap; increased volumes and high labour costs force the industry to reduce manual segregation and increase shredding; this requires more automation of sorting facilities; producer regulations increase the responsibility for the supply side to ensure identifiability of the materials they provide, through to the point of recycling.  Automated sorting operations are all based on Near Infra-Red spectroscopy, which can rapidly recognize the NIR signature of different polymers, and activate sorting equipment to segregate the polymer types.  NIR is the only technique that is fast enough, powerful enough and robust enough to be usable on a recycling line.  BUT the NIR technique fails to â€œseeâ€ black materials and some colours, because the carbon black pigment used also absorbs the NIR beam and prevents the reflection of the polymerâ€™s characteristic spectrum back to the sensor.  This project, based on our successful previous work, will develop a range of â€œNIR transparentâ€ alternatives to carbon black, to enable the NIR sorting operations to segregate black and coloured plastic where they have been unable to before, to a purity that will be usable in high value recycled engineering polymers. We will base our market entry strategy on a â€œspiral economyâ€ approach, where the packaging industry uses virgin detectable polymer to make their packaging, and this, with its product life of under one year, is recycled into high quality engineering plastics for the manufacturers of automotive and consumer durables to use without waiting for returns from their own end-of-life materials.",2017-06-01,2019-05-31,1005762.5,,['recycling'],1,3

On a world scale basis, 10 % of post-industrial scraps and the equivalent of 10 % of post-consumer products represent a potential of a Billion â‚¬ market. The MMAtwo project main objective is to construct a novel and fast growing PMMA recycling value chain through depolymerization and recovery of a monomer grade sold at 90 % of virgin MMA price. MMAtwo targets to reduce the energy needs by more than 70 % and the CO2 emissions by more than 60 %. To achieve its objective, MMAtwo integrates representative players along the value chain. During the project, PMMA will be collected from production scraps, but also from End-of-Life vehicles, Electronics goods, constructionâ€¦. The lead-free depolymerization process will be validated at TRL7 enabling the possibility of a first commercial unit soon after the end of the project. A versatile purification process will be validated through repolymerization of the produced monomer. MMA grades produced will be validated in several optical and non-optical applications. The inorganic fractions from PMMA composites will also be valorized. The project will establish standards for post-consumer and post-production PMMA based products in order to facilitate the recycling. Training and education activities will be organized in order to prepare the next generation of Engineers and Researchers in the field of closed-loop polymer recycling. The new value chain will benefit to the entire PMMA industry, as post-production and post-consumer products will be collected and processed by and independent company servicing the major PMMA producers and their customers.",2018-10-01,2022-09-30,6664702.76,,['recycling'],1,3

The permanent magnets in motors/generators of (H)EVs are either NdFeB or SmCo magnets, which contain large quantities of rare earths, which are critical metals with the highest supply risk for Europe. As highlighted by the European Rare Earths Competency Network, recycling of rare-earth magnets from (H)EVs should receive top priority. Reclaiming of rare-earth magnet motors/generators used in (H)EVs is a major challenge because the magnets are difficult to remove from the assemblies. The conventional hydrometallurgical routes for the recovery of rare earths from End-of-Life permanent magnets have a high environmental impact due to inefficient use of chemicals, whereas the conventional pyrometallurgical routes for the production of magnet master alloys are energy-inefficient. DEMETER, the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles, concurrently develops (1) innovative, environmentally-friendly direct and indirect recycling strategies for the permanent magnets in the motors and generators of (H)EVs that are currently already on the market and (2) design-for-reuse solutions for motors and generators in the (H)EVs of the future. An intersectoral and interdisciplinary consortium of leading EU universities, research institutes and manufacturers from the automotive and magnet sector trains 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs). The research challenges include the development of hydrogen-based grain-refinement technologies to produce nanograin magnets directly from scrap magnets, the recovery of rare earths from SmCo and NdFeB magnets of motors/generators by ionometallurgical methods, and the design of motors/generators with reusable magnets, where the designs are based on 2D and 3D flux paths as well as non-traditional materials.",2015-09-01,2019-08-31,3802512.24,,['recycling'],1,3

However, the low concentration of target metals and presence of other metals in the industrial wastewater makes the recovery challenging. BioFlot aims to explore the use of amphiphilic siderophores (marinobactins) from Marinobacter sp. as highly specific extractants for recovery of CRMs (In, and Ga) from secondary sources (industrial wastewater) by means of bio-flotation technique. Marinobactins are composed of amphiphilic and hydroxamate functional groups which makes them an ideal candidate for bioflotation. The marinobactin-CRM interactions will be studied at molecular levels which will shed the light on their unexplored capacities and form the basis for the development of recovery process. The project proposes to employ the marinobactins as green flotation extractants in bioflotation technique for metal recovery and subsequent extraction and optimization of process parameters for maximum selective binding of metals and marinobactins so as to increase the flotation yield. And further optimization for separation of marinobactin from metals in flotation product to regenerate marinobactin and recover target metal. The next phase of the project would involve semi-continuous and continuous experiments to scale-up the best possible configuration selected during the batch study. Finally, an economic evaluation will be carried out to support the commercialization of the developed technology.
This project will develop a novel and ecofriendly recycling process which will increase the recycling rates, reduce the waste and proliferate the circular economy in EU and also contribute in reducing its CRM dependency on non-EU countries.

920,791509,CELION,Circular Economy applied to LI-ION batteries for smart electric mobility in cities,"Recycling of automotive Li-ion batteries is complicated and not yet established because few End of Life (EoL) batteries will need recycling for another decade. Currently, re-using Li-ion batteries in 2nd-life applications is not as simple as removing a battery from a vehicle then installing it directly into a stationary system. Before a battery can be reused, it first must be manually removed from a vehicle and the pack disassembled into individual cells that must be tested to determine the batteryâ€™s state of health (SoH), sending batteries without sufficient remaining capacity to be recycled. Even within the batteries suitable for reuse, cells must be sorted by similar remaining capacity, or else the 2nd life system performance would suffer. Thus, there are still clear technological, environmental and social needs in the field of reconditioning and reuse of existing Li-ion batteries of electric and hybrid cars within the small Electric Vehicles (EV) sector. They must be satisfied to get a smooth transition towards e-mobility model. 

Under this scenario, ALBUFERA has developed an innovative Business Model (BM) based on circular economy principles capable to place on the market a set of 5 new products & services: 1) Technical advisory services for 1st life batteries (1) (Customer: Large EV manufacturer); 2) Supply  of 2nd life batteries for electric motorcycles (2), electric bicycles (3) and golf carts (4) (Customer: small EV manufacturer) and O&M services and 3) supply of recycled materials of useless 2nd life batteries (5) (Customer: recycling companies).

A method (ISOPREP) is proposed for recycling polypropylene (PP) products into virgin quality PP and hence reusable for the production of the highest grade PP products. The method exploits a novel ionic polymer solvent designed for highly tuned solubility of PP, patented within the partnership, with the key advantages/innovations:
(1) A performance identical to PP resin freshly manufactured from fossil sources
(2) Cost effective compared with producing PP from fossil sources
(3) Reduces the reliance of PP production on fossil resources
(4) Achieves a step reduction on life cycle emissions and energy compared with the use of fossil resources 
(5) Is entirely closed loop with negligible loss of solvent per cycle and hence negligible emissions thus non-polluting
(6) The solvent is non-toxic and non-flammable in the process temperature range
(6) Removes dyes, colours and impurities
(7) Prevents sending end of life PP products to landfill and avoids them polluting both land and sea

PP is used in a huge variety of products such as automobile interiors, consumer goods packaging, electronics, construction materials, carpets and other home furnishings. The global PP market, accessible by the ISOPREP system, was estimated at â‚¬65bn per annum in 2017, totaling approximately 23% of the entire plastics market. Given the typically short life of PP products, only 1% of which are recycled, there is a great need to implement innovative and disruptive technologies to mediate this trend.

Although applicable to a wide range of products, the concept will be developed and demonstrated at pilot plant stage for recycling polypropylene carpet at TRL7, based on prior and patented knowledge within the partnership at TRL5.",2018-10-01,2021-09-30,6315555.0,,['recycling'],1,3

The smart grid promises to drastically change the way power is produced, exchanged and traded. In 2017, almost 40% of the 281M electricity customers in Europe had a smart meter, a share that is set to increase to 70% over the coming years. As a consequence, annual shipments of smart electricity meters will reach a peak of around 28M units per year in 2019/2020. To date, Member States have committed to rolling out close to 200M smart meters for electricity by 2020 at a total potential investment of â‚¬45B. A smart meter system employs several control devices, various sensors to identify parameters, software and communication protocols to transfer the data and command signals. Furthermore, each business case is unique, varying according to the regulatory system, business objectives and design of the existing grid. Therefore, the design, deployment and maintenance of the smart meter system involve many challenges. Integration of devices for modulation, demodulation and additional memory for storing the data logs could take months, hence increasing the overall deployment costs. Whereas, operation of a smart meter system involves a huge quantity of data transfer between a smart meter and the server located.  The traditional system integration approach is inefficient and slows downs utilitiesâ€™ digital transformation, due to: expensive and long deployment, poor flexibility and expensive scale up.

These annual 2.5 billion tonnes of waste contain large volumes of valuable materials for Europeâ€™s industrial base. Proper collection of waste is a pre-condition for their optimal recovery. The current trend of increasing higher collection rates is promising, but progress is uneven between Members States and between regions. 

Good regional practices have the potential to serve as good practice examples for other regions. So far, however, results of existing studies and good practices have not been effective enough in supporting the implementation of better-performing systems elsewhere. The main objective of the COLLECTORS project is to overcome this situation and to support decision-makers in shifting to better-performing collection system.

COLLECTORS will therefore: 

(1) Increase awareness of the collection potential by compiling, harmonizing and presenting information on systems for packaging and paper waste, WEEE and construction products via an online information platform.
(2) Improve decision-making on waste collection by the assessment of twelve good practices on their performance on: (1) quality of collected waste; (2) economics; (3) environment; (4) societal acceptance. 
(3) Stimulate successful implementation by capacity-building and policy support methods that will increase the technical and operational expertise of decision-makers on waste collection.
(4) Engage citizens, decision-makers and other stakeholders throughout the project for validation of project results and to ensure the usability of COLLECTORS-output. 

The COLLECTORS consortium is well-equipped to achieve these impacts as it is directly connected to more than 30 PROS and 2000\ authorities spread across the EU.

931,779538,ZEFER,Zero Emission Fleet vehicles For European Roll-out,"Despite considerable support for the hydrogen mobility sector, there remains low take-up of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and vehicle sales remain low. This is a significant issue for the commercialisation of the sector, as whilst sales volumes are low, vehicle production costs and prices remain high. The lack of demand for hydrogen also damages the business case for investment in early hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS).  

The ZEFER project proposes a solution to this issue. ZEFER will demonstrate viable business cases for captive fleets of FCEVs in operations which can realise value from hydrogen vehicles, for example by intensive use of vehicles and HRS, or by avoiding pollution charges in city centres with applications where the refuelling characteristics of FCEVs suit the duty cycles of the vehicles. ZEFER aims to drive sales of FCEVs in these applications to other cities, thereby increasing sales volumes of FCEVs and improving the business case for HRS serving these captive fleets.   

ZEFER will deploy 180 FCEVs in Paris, Brussels and London. 170 FCEVs will be operated as taxi or private hire vehicles, and the remaining 10 will be used by the police. The vehicle customers are all partners in the project, so that deployments will occur quickly, (the majority of vehicles will be deployed by the end of 2018) and FCEV mileage will be accumulated rapidly (in Paris and Brussels mileages will be over 90,000 km/year; and in London mileages will be over 40,000 km/year). These applications mean that vehicle performance will be tested to the limit, allowing a demonstration of the technical readiness of new generation FCEVs for high usage applications. The vehicles will be supported by existing and planned HRS. ZEFER will complement these ambitious deployments with robust data collection, analysis of the business cases and technical performance of the deployments.

It can provide up to 20 kWh /day for up to 25 years without the need to change a battery.
With SUBPORT project we aim to disrupt into the offshore Oil&Gas market by providing a standalone supply power tidal turbine that will enable our customers to save up to â‚¬ 15 Mill.  We expect that our technology will allow us to reach a turnover of â‚¬ 22.8 Mill by selling 45 units and increase our staff 5 times by 2024. Yet, to achieve the commercialisation stage we still need to validate our turbine with potential customers` equipment and get the necessary certifications, and we must plan the dissemination and exploitation activities.
Thus, we have decided to continue with SUBPORT for what we need an additional investment of â‚¬ 3 Mill, that will give us a ROI of 6.8 by 2024. Therefore, we consider essential to perform a detailed feasibility study to continue with our project and decided to ask for funding through this SME instrument.",2017-06-01,2017-09-30,50000.0,['Wind'],['wave energy'],2,2
934,762458,Waste Compactor,Green Automatic Waste Compactor,"Households and businesses more and more often face with the trash piling up in bins, even if sorted properly. The sheer volume of waste causes more maintenace, more driving to reycling facilities and more costs of municipal waste management. It is a wide problem: every EU citizen on average throws away 444 kg of household waste per year.

Our Green Automatic Waste Compactor can help. By compressing recyclable trash, It reduces their volume. Modern user just needs to put the plastic, PET bottles, tins, or cans inside, press the button and the volume is automatically reduced.

Green Automatic Waste Compactor uses our patented horizontal press, which enables integration under kitchen counter, in a drawer or standalone solution. It takes up to 75% less kitchen space than competition, but can still reduce the waste volume by 80%. Also, it is a universal solution for all materials and enables further waste sorting, whereas competition uses either plastic or can dedicated solutions, or compacts all trash in one unsortable cube.

Our solution is aimed at the segment of small EU waste producers: households, restaurants, offices, airplanes, stores and similar small businesses with limited space options. We will target Slovenia, Austria, Germany and Switzerland first, followed by Scandinavian and Benelux countries. The reason is in highest eco consciousness of those citizens, relative high waste costs, and our existing network in these countries that will ease market access. In 5 years, we conservatively project 5000 sold units, 2.1 mio â‚¬ sales income, 20-25% netto profit margin and at least 15 new jobs.

We have first working prototype, already protected with patent. In Phase 1 we will develop new prototype on the basis of first one, to cover all target segment needs, confirm it on the market and protect it as well. Also, we will search for partners (technical merchants, kitchen appliances producers) for commercialization on EU markets and prepare a strategic business plan.",2017-02-01,2017-07-31,50000.0,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2
935,735368,DEBS,Dall Energy Biomass System,"Problem
By 2050 the EU aims at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% when compared to 1990 levels, requiring a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as biomass. Both the emissions from and the price of converting biomass to energy must be reduced if biomass is to compete with fossil fuels. 

Solution â€“ the innovation
Dall Energy has developed a new, disruptive biomass furnace, which integrates several independent innovations into a novel concept for conversion of biomass into energy with at least 10% lower investment and 40-60% lower operational expenses, while at the same time reducing emissions to unprecedented low levels.

Customers and market 
Dall Energy targets three market segments, district heating, energy for industry and power production (in go-to-market order) of which the first alone constitutes a market value in EU of â‚¬17-19 billion, showing a growing trend. 

Impacts
Customers are offered lower investment and operational costs, minimal emissions, easier operation and high modulation capability. The reduced costs of energy from biomass will reduce or even bring down a critical barrier for EU to bring greenhouse gas emissions down, potentially having a tremendous impact on society.
Dall Energy expects a turnover of â‚¬83m and 1,810 jobs created by 2020 and EU will see a solution that is able to bring down emissions and increase both economic and technical efficiency as set forward by directive 20165/2193. 

The project
Commercial hypotheses will be tested through premium price models targeted turnkey partners, analyses of the market situation and risk assessments. Technical features of the Dall Energy furnace will be presented to four named potential turnkey partners, and they will give feedback on sales and price models, implementation strategy in production setup, and product application, product features and potential for further application development.",2016-08-01,2016-10-31,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'district heating']",2,2
936,720853,AMPHIBIAN,Anisometric permanent hybrid magnets based on inexpensive and non-critical materials,"Permanent magnets are crucial in modern technology as they allow storing, delivering and converting energy. They are able to transform electrical energy into mechanical and vice versa, which means that improving their performance entails transforming energy in a more efficient and sustainable way.
The best magnets are based on rare-earths (RE), however, their status as a Critical Raw Material (CRM) has brought forward the realization that it is of great strategic, geographic, environmental and socio-economic importance to consider alternative magnets that present a reduced amount (or absence) of RE. One of the most sought approaches towards this goal consists on constructing composite magnetic materials magnetically coupled at the interface.
In the framework of the success of a previous European Project (FP7-SMALL-NANOPYME-310516), focused on improving ferrite-based magnets, we developed a low-cost novel approach (Patent P201600092) that exploits the magnetostatic interactions within these composites and that yielded extremely promising results in the form of an experimental proof-of-concept. 
The goal of this project is to implement up-scalable and cost-efficient methods for fabrication of ferrite-based dense anisotropic magnets with a 40% enhanced magnetic performance (energy products above 55 kJ/m3) with respect to commercial ferrites. We aim at producing improved magnets that retain the advantages of ferrites â€“availability, sustainability, cost, recyclability, eco-friendliness- and which have the potential to substitute currently used RE magnets (CRM) in the electric power system.
Our targeted application is an electric energy storage device: we will substitute RE magnets by AMPHIBIAN ones in a demonstrator of a flywheel and evaluate its performance against cost, eco-friendliness and resource efficiency criteria.",2017-01-01,2019-12-31,4948707.5,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2

The wide range of ND applications includes polishing and lapping materials, lubricants, various coatings, polymers, thermal conductive materials, catalysts, materials for energy storage (particularly, onion-like carbons produced from ND), radiation resistant composites and diverse biomedical solutions (cancer treatment, early diagnostics, cell imaging, etc.).
Ray's technology for producing nanodiamonds is based on the laser treating of specially prepared targets containing carbon soot and hydrocarbon binder. In contrast to the traditional technology of ND synthesis by detonation of explosives in metal reactors, Ray's method is controllable, environment-friendly and non-hazardous. Ray ND are higly pure and uniform. Industrial manufacturing of ND by Ray technology will lead to significant reducing the cost, better results in most existing applications, rapid enhancing of Global ND Powder Market and appearance of new ND applications where the purity and homofrneity of the powder is of special importance.
The proposed technological chain enables manufacturing of Advanced ND Additives (ANDA), which, in contrast to non-modified raw ND, can be easily mixed with chosen matrix and form highly homogeneous ND compounds or objects with improved properties.

EU is encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels towards the adoption of renewable energy as a resource. All new buildings are required to be nearly zero energy balance by the end of 2020.Currently, the solar industry is limited to a utility scale central power generation model. A highly differentiated product is required to disrupt this model and provide accessible solar power for the residential market. The EU is currently installing less than 100,000 residential solar roofs per year; this needs to increase to 3,000,000 per year to avoid worst scenario climate change. Current solar roofs use large utility scale panels and often complex installation; it is a very capital intensive process. Energyntegration technology preserves and improves aesthetics of the buildings whilst minimising installing costs for the property owners. The product series is based on a moulded aluminium frame that can be painted in the desired colour and covered with a front glass with low adsorption and transparent solar quality. The tile is easily installed onto roofs without any truss modification. The integration with the existing roof is complete, as the tile matches perfectly slope, level and colour of every type of roof, thus enabling the installation also in areas with historical or landscape restrictions. The panel produces electricity by solar conversion while the heat sink cool down the PV temperature while also exploiting the â€˜wasteâ€™ heat productively, thus increasing the efficiency of the single tile. HyTile targets the residential and re-roofing markets to promote the development of Net Zero Energy Homes.The Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy and to plan all activities for deploying a pilot installation in three historical cities.",2016-03-01,2016-06-30,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'PV']",2,2

940,703864,SNAPCAT,Scanning probe energy loss spectroscopy of Nanoscale Alloy Particles for heterogeneous CATalysis,"Most heterogeneous catalysts take the form of catalytically active nanoparticles dispersed over a support medium. To improve catalytic function and reduce waste, researchers are increasingly seeking to improve the homogeneity of these nanoparticles, whether it be their size, shape or composition. One of the difficulties facing researchers is that the techniques used to obtain quantitative information are typically averaged over ensembles of billions of nanoparticles. Measurements of individual clusters require access to expensive instrumentation such as a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The proposed research will apply scanning probe energy loss spectroscopy (SPELS) to study the composition, size and shape of individual size-selected Pt-based binary alloy nanoparticles for fuel cell applications, deposited using an inert gas-aggregation source. In SPELS, a STM tip is used as a highly localised source of field-emitted electrons to stimulate surface excitations such as plasmons. The energy of inelastically backscattered electrons from the surface is analysed with a spectrometer, so that spectroscopic mapping of the surface can be obtained as the tip is rastered across the surface. This comparatively low-cost method is capable of producing a spatial resolution of 1-10 nm, so that the composition of individual nanoparticles can be sampled. SPELS will be used, in conjunction with STM, to study the composition and surface structure of bimetallic clusters before and after reaction. This data will be correlated with data on the reactivity of the clusters, probed by CO temperature programmed desorption measurements. These measurements will be used to tailor nanoparticle composition and improve homogeneity, resulting in more efficient catalysts.",2016-05-01,2018-04-30,195454.8,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,2

Of these, the most ecoefficient bioplastic is PLA as it is biodegradable, requires 50% less energy and produces 10 times less emissions in comparison to standard thermoplastics like PET and PP. Furthermore, as it does not need to be recycled, it not only saves the energy and cost involved, but also the fact that only a fraction of the plastic produced reaches the recycling plant, the rest ending up in landfill or the sea.

However, biodegradable plastics only make up approximately 0.2% of plastics produced in 2014. This is because conventional PLA has certain technical limitations which reduce the number of marketable applications where it can be used. For example, it cannot compete with standard thermoplastic grades used in packaging applications (such as PET and PE), in terms of oxygen and water vapour barrier and thermal properties, which are the most demanded properties for packaging requirements.
Advanced & Functional Technologies for Biocomposites S.L (ADBIOCOMPOSITES) has developed an innovative, biodegradable PLA grade named BlockPLA which has enhanced technical properties: oxygen and water vapour barrier, thermal stability, transparency and flexibility. BlockPLA solves the drawbacks that PLA currently shows for packaging applications. In addition, BlockPLA has food contact approval and requires less energy to be produced. Production costs are slightly lower than conventional PLA.

Therefore, BlockPLA is a real biodegradable alternative to PET, PP and PLA for packaging applications in the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical and biomedical industry, home care packaging, cosmetics industry and others.
ADBIOCOMPOSITES aims to use the SME instrument to scale up the production of BlockPLA and bring it to the packaging market, generating estimated revenues in 2022 of over 1.6Mâ‚¬ and providing 8 new jobs, with a ROI on project costs of 135%.",2016-08-01,2016-12-31,50000.0,,"['recycling', 'bioplastic']",2,2

Tamturbo Oy is a high tech start-up company bringing the turbo compressor technology to medium size oil free compressed air applications of 50 to 250 kW as the only European manufacturer which is speeding up the revolution of the 10 Bâ‚¬ compressed air industry.
In the award winning Tamturbo direct drive design the turbo wheels of a two stage compressor are directly coupled to a high speed electric motor.  The main benefits of the turbo design over state-of-the-art dry screw compressors are 15 % lower electricity consumption over the 10-15 year life cycle, decreased operating, maintenance, waste management and overhaul costs due to minimum wear, and the benefit over other turbo designs is better capacity control under variable loads. 
Fast business growth is attempted by offering the compressors and related service packages under Tamturbo brand in Scandinavia and under Private Label or OEM contracts in other markets.  Medium size compressor manufacturers which do not have access to oil free technology today are seen as the most promising commercialization partners. However, extensive field testing of prototype compressors is needed before full commercialization of the technology. 
The objectives of the feasibility study is to acquire direct feedback from end users and potential Private Label and OEM partners as well as to identify European industrial field testing sites for prototype compressors. The Tamturbo business plan including marketing and IPR strategies will be refined accordingly.

One promising way to use this potential is to pelletise the residues for their combustion in CHP plants. This potential is not used, though, as most farmers produce a variety of different residues and none of the currently available pelletising machines is able to process them all simultaneously.
Pusch GmbH & Co. KG has developed an innovative new technology which allows the processing of all kinds of agricultural residues as well as mixtures of residues occurring in the EU. A first technical prototype has demonstrated the proper functioning and huge potentials of the technology. However, improvements and adaptations are required to achieve the market breakthrough. In this proposed project a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility of the envisaged improvements and the optimal way of implementation, while a business plan will show the optimal way of commercialisation.
The new pelletising machine will allow the European farmers to use the full energetic potential of their residues and therefore significantly increase their income while at the same time helping Europe to reach its goals of climate control. At current market prices for pellets an additional turnover of 14 billion â‚¬ per year can potentially be generated at EU level and up to 137 million tons of CO2 can be saved compared to fossil fuels. At the same time Pusch GmbH & Co.

According to the EC, transport is the only major sector in the EU where greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, with road transport contributing about one-fifth of the EU's total CO2 emissions. Despite the existence of environmentally friendly electric vehicles, CO2 emissions continue to rise in the sector. This is because of range anxiety, the single greatest obstacle to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EV) and the environmental benefits they offer. As a result, while 44% of drivers consider emissions & environmental friendliness as important factors when buying a car, only 5% would consider buying an electric car due to range concerns. Whilst automotive manufacturers have sought to address the issue of range anxiety through the installation of range extenders, these existing extenders are limited in performance and do not fully meet vehicle manufacturers (OEM) needs. The clear business opportunity is to provide tier 1 automotive powertrain providers and OEMs with breakthrough innovation in EV range extender technology that meets all of their needs. These include; high efficiency, low fuel consumption, low emissions, low noise, compact size, light weight and low vibration. The rotary (Wankel) type engine lends itself extremely well to this application, but has a number of inherent limitations. The key innovations in our solution (refer section 1.3) eliminate the disadvantages of the rotary engine whilst building upon its inherent strengths. Our breakthrough solution is novel, patent protected and lab tested/demonstrated at prototype stage. We initially require help to undertake a feasibility study to elaborate and de-risk our business plan.

959,672942,NZE Buildings,Developing replicable and cost effective Nearly Zero-Energy' building solutions for small builders in Europe,"'The building sector is responsible for the majority of the energy consumption in the world. It is also a key challenge for the
20-20-20 strategy of the EU.

Sustainable housing starts with 'near zero-energy' buildings, i.e. homes that are so well insulated that it becomes easy to
produce more renewable energy on site than what is consumed.

Today, house construction in Europe is mainly performed by craftsmen who are small local builders and who work with
traditional technics and who are not keen to invest on research and development of Modern Methods of Construction
(MMC). As a consequence, it remains very difficult for consumers and investors to buy 'plus energy' houses in Europe (costs
and lack of offer due to lack of know-how).

The objective of the project is to provide to local builders the products and the tools so that they can offer to their customers
'nearly zero-energy' buildings with guaranteed performance and cost controls.

To do so, ECOXIA has developed the concept of 'Smart Envelope'. Built in the ideal conditions of the factory, the envelope
is installed in a 'Plug & Play' way on site in one day. It includes both energy performance and the components to make it
smart.

ECOXIA developed a prototype in 2012 to check the performance of its building envelope. Installed in Yerres, France, it
proved the interest of the concept from a mechanical, thermal, comfort and cost standpoints. The recorded consumption
proves that the prototype is a 'plus energy' building with the production of only 20 sqm of photovoltaic solar panels.

To be able to commercialise the right solution and help Europe to develop a new industry, ECOXIA needs to go further into
its feasibility study by addressing the following questions:
- which is the best level of prefabrication?
- how can we improve the price of our solution for the European market ?
- who are the best potential partners for our project in Europe?
- what are the regulatory issues on the most relevant markets in Europe?'",2015-05-01,2015-10-31,50000.0,,"['renewable energy', 'photovoltaic']",2,2

technology, offering significant benefits to growers due to the use of advanced polymer nano-composites. FILMCO
is a greenhouse film that has already probed to provide the growers with energy consumption savings by 24-28%, and
increase their crop production by 20%. FILMCOâ€™s main innovation is the ability to regulate the Photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR) for a given Infrared Radiation (IR), thus controlling the degree of rightness/darkness according to the
location requirements. The novel film will have increased robustness, added to higher pesticide and UV and oxidation
resistance. The film will create a controlled environment in the greenhouse while lowering energy demands, reducing costs
and promoting a better use of resources and higher crop yield. The longer lifespan will also reduce plastic waste and
decrease waste management expenses. Although nanotechnology has emerged in industrial applications over the last
decades, there is no similar commercial product available in the growing greenhouse agriculture market that matches the
benefits and competitive advantages of FILMCO. FILMCO, with TRL 6, is the outcome of a national research project in
which Elysee already demonstrated these promising results benefits for growers, so it became a success history. Via
FILMCO, Elysee estimates a new revenue stream valued at 13.7Mâ‚¬ over the first 5 years of commercialisation, and also will

H2StationÂ® is a Hydrogen Refueling Station that already today is providing fast 70MPa hydrogen fueling for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) from major car manufacturers.

The new H2StationÂ® technology has prior to the HyFast project reached a TRL5 level through extensive R&D for more than â‚¬3 million. This effort represents a â€œPhase 1â€ which has been conducted through several projects supported by national R&D programs and the European FCH-JU program. The HyFast project acts as the â€œPhase 2â€ where the H2StationÂ® technology is to reach a TRL8 level enabling market introduction. 

The H2StationÂ® technology is developed in collaboration with a EU supplier base of 73 companies from 10 countries. With HyFast the present EU supplier share of 62% of the cost basis of a H2StationÂ® is to be increased to 80%. Additionally several key market stakeholders such as Toyota, BMW, Hyundai, Siemens and Shell will provide market input and serve as later market entry platforms. 

With the HyFast project capacity and performance is to be increased and cost reduced to a level that enables commencing of market introduction in Europe during 2017 and for USA and Japan during 2018-2019.  

HyFast is in particular to increase fueling capacity to a level that corresponds to what is achieved on an average gasoline dispenser. This will be paramount for achieving a profitable roll-out and operation of networks of hydrogen fueling stations. Further footprint of the technology is to be reduced to enable integration at conventional gasoline stations. 

HyFast is to achieve the EU FCH-JU program 2020 CAPEX target of â‚¬0.8 million for at turn-key hydrogen fueling station already by 2017.

up until the revolutionary change to LCD and plasma screens that has recently taken place. Consequently, the current CRT
population (1.9 billion screens; 500 million of them in Europe) is becoming obsolete and will require processing (not landfill)
according to WEEE regulations, since the high proportion of lead in the glass means that landfills have an unacceptable risk
of lead leaching into groundwater. The very low manufacturing rates for new CRT worldwide now mean that recycling the
glass back into CRTs is no longer an option, and the only alternatives to avoid landfill have been to use the glass as a
smelting flux (85% of it remains as a toxic slag), or using foundry temperatures (1000Â°C) melt extraction for the lead, which
is extremely energy and CO2 costly, and at best produces an 80% co-stream of low value glass.
Our idea is to process leaded CRT glass using a novel hydrochemistry method to precipitate out the lead, which can be sold.
The residual output stream from our VirtuCrete process contains an alumino-silicate mix that can be used as an alternative
to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), to produce a high-silica concrete geopolymer block. This new material has exceptional
resistance to salt, acids and water, making it suitable harsh conditions and flood defences, and high temperature resistance
(over 1200Â°C) making it applicable to fire risk applications such as road tunnels or waste storage segregation. The novel
chemistry also allows use of recycled aggregate, potentially reducing the cost of our geoblocks by 50% compared to OPC
blocks. The new technology could enable EU waste recyclers and concrete block producers to co-operate to solve the CRT

This tool, based upon Climoteâ€™s home heating hub, will help delivers Europeâ€™s goal of a low carbon economy by allowing advanced demand management of heating and cooling to help prevent curtailment of European wind farms. Using the hub we can collect information about the householdâ€™s energy usage and create a profile for that household. This profile shows what energy is used for and when. We can then schedule certain regular and predictable tasks to happen automatically. By removing the need for manual control, not only do we make peopleâ€™s lives more convenient, but we also remove human error from the equation, resulting in less energy wastage, Furthermore these tasks can be scheduled to take place at certain times, such as during off peak hours when the cost of energy is lower and there is excess renewable energy on the grid. This has both the advantage of reducing energy waste, and of shifting consumption to renewable sources. 
Domestic homes account for about 27% of Europeâ€™s total energy consumption. Of this the majority is made up of space and water heating and cooling which is responsible for over 80% of domestic household emissions.

The latest data show a yearly production of 9.637 thousands of tons in Europe. Sludge treatment issues are often neglected in comparison with water-related parameters which results in serious technical difficulties and highly expensive disposal methods. An energy efficient, environmentally sound and economically viable process for sludge disposal and reuse of valuable resources e.g. phosphorus hardly exists.
The most common disposal methods for sludge are spreading on agricultural soil, composting and incineration. Landfilling has been long banned, the use as fertilizer, although very moderate in costs, is being banned in many regions due to concerns about contamination of soils with heavy metals and endocrine disruptive compounds. Incineration entails the highest costs (80-110 â‚¬ /ton), but is also considered the safest disposal method and is fast growing and widely adopted. It presents also technical difficulties, such as the low overall efficiency of the process, the huge logistic efforts required to transport the sludge to the incineration plants, or the disposal of the ashes after the sludge has been incinerated.
In this situation, the proposing company, AVA-CO2 has the objective to demonstrate and commercialize their proprietary technology for hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to the conditions of sewage sludge, showing clearly technical and economic advantages against the current sludge incineration method. AVA-CO2 aims to increase the amount of sludge converted into high value products such as fuel, activated carbons for water treatment, recovered phosphorus, soil remediation material, carbon sequestration schemes and other applications.

The high-performing material proposed, based on a commercial PEEK-Carbon Fiber Prepreg with addition of amorphous (PEI) films, answers to the needs to have reduced weight and consequently reduced fuel consumptions and emissions on an aircraft, as well as reduced manufacturing and operational costs. Demonstration aero-structures will be fabricated by an innovative working cell implementing an advanced continuous automated production process, including: automated hybrid material fabrication; manufacturing of skin panels by automated fiber placement in-situ consolidation process; fabrication of stringers by continuous forming; component assembly by induction welding. The innovative material, conceived and patented by a partner of the Consortium, is an example of multifunctional composite, since it returns both functions of toughness improvement (multilayer material) and process simplification. This concept on one side will provide an advantage from the structural point of view, in terms of better impact damage performance; while on the other side major advantages will result on processing simplification, in particular including improved cycle times and lower energy consumptions, since it does not require the use of an autoclave curing phase. As of today, its usage has been limited to fabricate panels, only at laboratory level; hence, a suitable improvement finalized to process in industrial environment is needed. Proposed process techniques and assembly will be the first step towards the industrial application of the innovative material. Consortium has set a target for weight saving not less than 5% for primary structures.

Their primary application is corrugated carton closure. However, existing solutions for this application present 3 key constrains:

1.RECYBLABILITY â€“ WASTE MANAGEMENT: One of the major issues for the label printing industry is the waste the process leaves behind, particularly the much maligned release liner. With consumption of self-adhesive label materials in Europe in 2010 totalling 5.3 billion square metres, translating into some 360,000 tonnes of paper liner waste emerging from end users.

2.TAMPER-EVIDENT: Cartons sealed with PSA or many of the water-activated adhesives are not secure and are not easily accessed without revealing any signs of tampering.

3.TAPE SEALING PROBLEM IN REFRIGERATED PACKAGES: Both PSAs and Water-Activated lack adherence depending on temperatures. They typically reduce or lose their tack at low temperatures and reduce their shear holding ability at high temperatures; special adhesives are made to function at high or low temperatures.

We have developed a product that provides a proper answer to this 3 needs: TAPEMELT: an adhesive system thermal activated that cover the existing constrains in the carton packing industry. It is 1) Low-cost; 2) Fast to apply 3) Strong: the integrity and safety of the goods are not compromised 3) Allows custom printing; 4) Theft-protection â€“ Tamper evident 5) it is made of paper: 100% recyclable, repulpable and biodegradable.",2017-02-01,2017-05-31,50000.0,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2

The use of geothermal energy or solar thermal energy is a good solution for energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Both technologies could not yet establish well on the market because of the lack of inexpensive and efficient low-temperature heating systems (flow temperature 20-30Â°C). Established underfloor heatings are very expensive and only installed in new buildings. Therefore the market is looking for new and innovative renewable solutions, especially for the renovation.
In order to meet this demand we have developed a new surface heating and cooling element (FHKE/TRL6). Objective of the SME Phase 1 project is the implementation of a feasibility study. The new developed heating and cooling panel shall enable a large scale application of low-temperature heating systems. Our element is characterized by the following advantages and therefore perfectly fits the requirements of our target customers (e.g. municipal companies, public estate administration offices, private owners of houses):
-reduced heating costs by at least 20% 
-low costs per mÂ²
-rapid mounting
-nearly no dust or dirt at renovation 
-small mass â€“ easy handling, low transport costs
-efficient and even heat distribution
The current market volume for low-temperature heating system amounts to 500 â€“ 1,000 million Euros. On the basis of imputed assumptions that within the next 15 years about 50% of the nearly 218 million European households need to be energetically redeveloped, this amounts to a market potential of at least 100 billion Euros related to sales.

Because a significant share of the energy input is provided in the form of heat, HT electrolysis achieves higher electrical system efficiency compared to low temperature electrolysis technologies. Therefore, the main objectives of the GrInHy project focus on:

â€¢  Proof of reaching an overall electrical efficiency of at least 80 %LHV (ca. 95 %HHV);
â€¢  Scaling-up the SOEC unit to a DC power input (stack level) of 120 kWel;
â€¢  Reaching a lifetime of greater 10,000 h with a degradation rate below 1 %/1,000 h;
â€¢  Integration and operation for at least 7,000 h meeting the hydrogen quality standards of the steel industry;

Additional project objectives are:
â€¢  Elaboration of an Exploitation Roadmap for cost reducing measures;
â€¢  Development of dependable system cost data;
â€¢  Integration of a reversible operation mode (fuel cell mode);

The objectives are congruent with the call FCH-02.4-2015 and the Multi Annual Work Plan of the FCH JU.

The proof-of-concept will take place in the relevant environment of an integrated iron and steel works. Its existing infrastructure and metallurgical processes, which provide the necessary waste heat, increase the projectÂ´s cost-effectiveness and minimize the electrical power demand of auxiliaries. As a result, the electrical efficiency of 80 % will be achieved by operating the HT electrolyser close to the thermal-neutral operation point. The installation will consist of an optimized multi-stack module design with 6 stacks modules in parallel (total capacity: 120 kWel). The last project year is dedicated to the testing of 7,000 h and more. This will be achieved due to a high degree of existing knowledge at system level.

It will thus have impact across the EIP Waterâ€™s thematic priorities and cross-cutting issues, particularly on â€˜Water reuse & recyclingâ€™, â€˜Water and wastewater treatmentâ€™, â€˜Water-energy nexusâ€™, â€˜Ecosystem servicesâ€™, â€˜Water governanceâ€™, and â€˜DSS & monitoringâ€™.",2016-06-01,2019-05-31,7837292.22,['Storage'],['recycling'],2,2
989,680070,BATMAN,Development of Quantitative Metrologies to Guide Lithium Ion Battery Manufacturing,"Lithium ion batteries offer tremendous potential as an enabling technology for sustainable transportation and development. However, their widespread usage as the energy storage solution for electric mobility and grid-level integration of renewables is impeded by the fact that current state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries have energy densities that are too small, charge- and discharge rates that are too low, and costs that are too high. Highly publicized instances of catastrophic failure of lithium ion batteries raise questions of safety.  Understanding the limitations to battery performance and origins of the degradation and failure is highly complex due to the difficulties in studying interrelated processes that take place at different length and time scales in a corrosive environment. In the project, we will (1) develop and implement quantitative methods to study the complex interrelations between structure and electrochemistry occurring at the nano-, micron-, and milli-scales in lithium ion battery active materials and electrodes, (2) conduct systematic experimental studies with our new techniques to understand the origins of performance limitations and to develop design guidelines for achieving high performance and safe batteries, and (3) investigate economically viable engineering solutions based on these guidelines to achieve high performance and safe lithium ion batteries.",2016-05-01,2021-04-30,1500000.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
990,675762,TERRE,Training Engineers and Researchers to Rethink geotechnical Engineering  for a low carbon future,"TERRE aims to develop novel geo-technologies to address the competitiveness challenge of the European construction industry in a low carbon agenda. It will be delivered through an inter-sectoral and intra-European coordinated PhD programme focused on carbon-efficient design of geotechnical infrastructure. Industry and Research in the construction sector have been investing significantly in recent years to produce innovative low-carbon technologies. However, little innovation has been created in the geo-infrastructure industry, which is lagging behind other construction industry sectors. TERRE aims to close this gap through a network-wide training programme carried out by a close collaboration of eleven Universities and Research Centres and three SMEs. It is structured to provide a balanced combination of fundamental and applied research and will eventually develop operational tools such as software for low-carbon geotechnical design and a Decision Support System for infrastructure project appraisal. The research fellows will be involved in inter-sectoral and intra-European projects via enrolment in 8 â€˜Joint-Awardsâ€™ and 7 â€˜Industrialâ€™ PhDs. The research fellows will be trained in low-carbon design by developing novel design concepts including eco-reinforced geomaterials, â€˜engineeredâ€™ vegetation, engineered soil-atmosphere interfaces, biofilms, shallow geothermal energy and soil carbon sequestration. Distinctive features of TERRE are the supervision by an inter-sectoral team and the orientation of the research towards technological applications. Training at the Network level includes the development of entrepreneurial skills via a special programme on â€˜Pathways to Research Enterpriseâ€™ to support the research fellows in establishing and leading spin-out companies after the end of the project.",2015-11-01,2019-10-31,3954945.78,,"['carbon sequestration', 'geothermal energy']",2,2
991,685727,ProDIA,"Production, control and Demonstration of structured hybrid nanoporous materials for Industrial adsorption Applications","The recent 20 years have seen the discovery of new classes of nanoporous materials (NPM). It includes amorphous micro-mesoporous aluminosilicate type materials and more recently Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). Despite the great potential of this new class of materials, we cannot recognize industrial success yet at the level of initial expectations and business opportunities.
The main reasons which limit the penetration of these materials on the market are that there is a very limited choice of materials available on the market with prices and shapes (powder) which are not compatible for a first demonstration.
In this respect, the objectives of ProDIA are:
- To develop production technologies and methods including shaping, for MOF and aluminosilicates, which are price competitive or at least in the same range as other state of the art porous solids such as advanced zeolites or carbons â€“ 10-100 â‚¬/kg 
- To set-up production facilities in Europe for the production of a variety of NPM with chemical and mechanical stabilities and with safety requirements which allow them to be sold, distributed and used in the industry.
The project will thus develop three innovative processes (water-based synthesis, mechanosynthesis, spray-drying) for cost-effective production of NPMs meeting industrial expectations with improved reliability and repeatability at pilot-scale. The industrial relevance of these NPMs will be demonstrated in four applications: gas storage, air purification, heat pump and health care.
The consortium is composed of 5 RTO, 1 university and 1 association together with 6 industrial partners, including 2 SMEs and a spin-off being created; linking technology providers and academic partners with industrial end-users. The consortium has well-balanced skill sets to achieve its objectives.
The financial resources mobilized by the 13 partners represent a total grant of 7 604 940 â‚¬ with a global effort of 757 PM.",2015-11-01,2018-10-31,7030831.5,['Storage'],['heat pump'],2,2

Our current understanding of the impact of microbial metabolism on the safety of geological repositories remains tenuous, even though microorganisms may have controlling influences on wasteform evolution in situ, multibarrier integrity and ultimately radionuclide migration from the repository. This proposal targets a number of â€œhigh urgencyâ€ and â€œhigh importanceâ€ topics identified in the most recent IGD-TP Strategic Research Agenda, focusing specifically on the influence of microbial processes on waste forms and their behavior, and the technical feasibility and long-term performance of repository components. The project will bring together, for the first time, 15 European groups working on the impact of microbial processes on safety cases for geological repositories across the EU, focusing on key questions posed by waste management organisations. The emphasis will be on quantifying specific measureable impacts of microbial activity on safety cases under repository-relevant conditions, thus altering the current view of microbes in repositories and leading to significant refinements of safety case models currently being implemented to evaluate the long-term evolution of radwaste repositories. The integration of society and policy oriented studies in the project will also extend the impact of the project outside the scientific and technical domain, while a study of expert conceptualization, public perception and risk communication concerning microbial influences in geological disposal, will improve awareness of microbial issues on a broader level. The programme will help the EU claim international leadership in the understanding of the impact of microbial processes on geodisposal, and indeed other technological areas pertinent to the exploitation of the subsurface.",2015-06-01,2019-05-31,4160234.5,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2

Local needs for ancillary services in distribution systems are supposed to co-exist with system needs for balancing and congestion management. Resources located in distribution systems, like demand side management and distributed generation, are supposed to participate to the provision of ancillary services both locally and for the system in the context of competitive ancillary services markets.
Through an in-depth and a simulation in a lab-environment, answers are sought for to the following questions:
â€¢	which ancillary services could be provided from distribution to the whole system (via transmission), 
â€¢	which optimized modalities could be adopted for managing the network at the TSO-DSO interface and what monitoring and control signals could be exchanged to carry out a coordinated action,
â€¢	how the architectures of the real time markets (in particular the balancing markets) could be consequently revised,
â€¢	what information has to be exchanged and how (ICT) for the coordination on the distribution-transmission border, starting from monitoring aspects, to guarantee observability and control of distributed generation, flexible demand and storage systems,
â€¢	which implications could the above issues have on the on-going market coupling process, that is going to be extended to real time markets in the next years, according to the draft Network Code on Electricity Balancing by ENTSO-E.

994,659306,ORRmetIR,Development and in situ Infrared study of Novel Strained Core-shell Electrocatalysts: Towards an Understanding of the Oxygen Reduction Mechanism,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical in fuel cells (FC), batteries and corrosion. Sluggish kinetics of the ORR remains a key barrier to efficient electricity generation in FC operating on renewable fuels such as hydrogen or alcohols. Poor understanding of the ORR mechanism has hindered development of cost-effective and improved FC catalysts. 
This project aims to bring about a step change in development and understanding of ORR catalysts by (i) synthesising metal nanoparticles with a strained surface structure, and (ii) developing and implementing new in situ and operando infrared (IR) spectroscopic techniques to understand how strain impacts the ORR mechanism. Novel strained core-shell Pt-based catalysts will be developed, featuring a core of inexpensive metals including Ni, Co or Cu. For the first time, insight into the ORR mechanism for supported electrocatalysts under realistic catalytic turnover will be gained by modifying an approach to combining IR spectroscopy and electrochemistry developed in the Vincent group. 
The University of Oxford is uniquely suited for this ambitious project: the applicant will be hosted in a strong research culture in catalysis, have access to state-of-the-art research infrastructure and technical expertise in spectroscopy and materials characterisation and industrial collaborations. The fellow will receive broad-ranging training in the synthesis of catalysts and surface characterisation. The host team will benefit from her skills in in situ vibrational spectroscopy, especially spectral interpretation of ORR intermediates. 
This highly interdisciplinary project combines nanomaterial synthesis, spectroscopy and electrocatalysis, and has strong potential for generation of intellectual property and commercialisation of new catalysts for FC, aiding knowledge transfer between academic and industrial sectors. This will increase Europeâ€™s competitiveness in FC and electrocatalysis, supporting Horizon 2020â€™s Energy Security goals.",2015-04-01,2017-03-31,195454.8,['Fuel'],['nanomaterial'],2,2

This is not without its challenges requiring more efficient ways to store electrical energy to balance demand with supply. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most desirable form of energy storage (high energy / power densities) but an increasing demand of Li commodity chemicals combined with geographically-constrained reserves will drive up prices in the future. Due to the high abundance, low costs and very suitable redox potential, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) should open new avenues of research and engineering as complementary alternatives to LIBs. This shift has to be accompanied with a deeper understanding of the chemical reactions involving the multiple cell components.
The proposed project focuses on a next step of in situ NMR spectroscopy, offering the unique possibility of non-invasive real-time studies of batteries under operating conditions â€“ to track the formation of intermediate phases and investigate electrolyte decomposition during cycling of LIBs and NIBs. Significantly different shifts of the multi-component samples, resonance broadening as well as interferences of the NMR and external battery cycler (EBC) circuit impair the experiments. Hence, we will set up a novel NMR probe system allowing â€œon-the-flyâ€ adjustment of the NMR circuit during the measurement and sample orientation changes via an automated goniometer. Moreover, an entirely new NMR-EBC-connection design will benefit the real-time experiments. This next level Automatic Tuning Matching Cycler (plus Goniometer) â€“ ATMC(\G) â€“ in situ NMR approach will be established in a comparative study on lithium vs. sodium iron phosphate cathodes in LIBs and NIBs, respectively, including the application of new electrolytes to improve battery safety and cost factors.

996,693361,UP-GREEN,UPscaling GRaphite Electrochemical ExfoliatioN,"The possible utilization of graphene as key component in composites, energy storage and conversion devices is heavily hampered by the limited availability of high-quality graphene materials. The current graphene production methods, such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition and chemical oxidation and exfoliation, suffer from extremely low yield of product, limited scalability or a strong chemical oxidation by which a significant number of defects are irreversibly introduced to the graphene. Thereby, it is highly desirable to develop scalable and green preparation protocols for which the oxidation is reduced to a minimum but the production speed of graphene is still high. During the ERC 2DMATER project, we found that the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite is the ideal approach to serve this demand under optimized conditions. Here in this project, we will further develop a lab-scale equipment and process that will be able to produce high quality graphene powders and dispersions on a scale of 1 kg per day, starting from commercially available graphite sources, like graphite foils, rods and papers. We target at producing bulk graphene with electronic properties outperforming those generated by state-of-the-art wet chemistry protocols - but with reduced number of process steps. Moreover, the technologies gained in this project will be transferred towards cheaper raw materials where we aim for direct production of graphene flakes from unprocessed natural resources in cooperation with our industry partner that owns several high grade graphite deposits in Sweden. Eventually, the efficient upscaling of graphite exfoliation developed in this project will bridge the gap between current lab-scale graphene production methods and industry-relevant scales in the most economical way. This will finally pave the way towards the actual industrial application of graphene in a broad range of fields it has been envisioned for during the last decade.",2016-01-01,2017-06-30,150000.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
997,658057,HS-GLASSion,Highly stable glasses applied for lithium ion battery electrolytes,"Lithium ion batteries (LIB) with a solid-state electrolyte component is one of the much desired goals for rechargeable energy sources since they provide with high safety, high reliability and high energy density. Inorganic glass-based electrolytes are very promising materials due to their higher ionic conductivity when compared to crystalline alternatives. Nevertheless, important concerns still have to be resolved and optimized. For instance, ionic conductivity in glass-based electrolytes continues to be poor compared to liquid electrolytes and their stability still lacks of long lifetime capability. In general, necessary innovative scenarios are needed as the next step forward in current thin film battery research. In order to improve performance and solve these issues in LIB's we propose, as the main purpose within HS-GLASS\ion, the addition of a new class of materials, the so called highly stable glasses (HSG). These glasses can achieve remarkable properties when prepared through vacuum deposition processes when tuning several parameters during film growth. This new discovery is well considered as an important development in glasses and supercooled liquids but still unknown in the area of energy storage. HSGâ€™s have higher densities which can help to easily create large homogeneous areas without any performance threatening artefacts. They are more resistant to temperature and vapor uptake which will increase chemical and structural stability of electrolytes. The lack of grain boundaries but the coinciding existence of short-range order will modify Li\ ion mobility achieving properties that have not yet been explored in battery research. The ability of tuning stability on HSGâ€™s will help boost interface engineering through gradient compositions between the electrodes and electrolyte. The outstanding properties of HSG's will help fulfill thin film technology needs and battery research current requirements.",2015-08-01,2017-07-31,172800.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2

All these problems have in common the need to obtain an accurate characterization of the Earth's subsurface, and to achieve this goal, several complementary areas will be studied, including the mathematical foundations of various high-order Galerkin multiphysics simulation methods, the efficient computer implementation of these methods in large parallel machines and GPUs, and some crucial geophysical aspects such as the design of measurement acquisition systems in different scenarios. 
Results will be widely disseminated through publications, workshops, post-graduate courses to train new researchers, a dedicated webpage, and visits to companies working in the area.

The final result of such a network is to educate professionals on these technologies for the European research and industry institutions. The consortium includes 14 universities that will implement the joint PhD programme, two research institutions (AIT and PROMES-CNRS), three companies and two SME (Arcelik, Abengoa Solar NT, KIC InnoEnergy, UFP and LAIF), that will cooperate in defining the programme and in its implementation and deployment.

1000,696023,SEAF,Standardisation and Communication of Sustainable Energy Asset Evaluation Framework,"The main barriers to finance of Sustainable Energy Assets (SEA) projects â€“ namely energy efficiency, demand response, distributed renewable energy generation and electricity storage â€“ are: 1) project valuation difficulties; 2) difficulties in project optimisation; 3) a communication gap between contractors and investors leading to a lack of trust. 
Today, protocols and tools exist for project valuation, but they are used separately, in different ways by different investors or contractors. Therefore, SEA projects are valuated on a one-off basis, without any standardisation. The SEAF project will significantly lower the entry barriers to finance for small to medium projects, through combining existing tools and protocols, namely Joule Assetsâ€™ market valuation tool, the risk assessment methodology from insurance company HSB and the Investor Confidence Projectâ€™s energy performance protocols. 
These three service tools will be integrated into an all-in-one, easy to use, single source valuation and risk assessment framework, which aims to: 1) Facilitate and support an intensive stakeholder engagement process; 2) Provide independent valuation and optimisation for SEA projects according to up-to-date energy market data; 3) Standardise energy efficiency valuation criteria for easy comparability with other similar projects; 4) Enable initial risk assessment at much lower cost and with less administrative effort; 5) Facilitate the matchmaking between investors and contractors; 6) Lay the foundation for robust exploitation. 
In addition to its demonstration with a large network of investors and contractors, SEAF seeks to enable investments of â‚¬10-15m and primary energy savings of 18-45 GWh/a over the course of its duration. Through its unique combination of services, SEAF will specifically target small projects, which would otherwise not get financed and it will have a disproportionately large impact on job creation, as reduced energy costs have a much stronger effect on SMEs.",2016-02-01,2018-05-31,1706366.25,['Storage'],['renewable energy'],2,2

a) to define a subsequent initiative, referred to as the Pilot Case, providing a model for establishing a European CO2 infrastructure project, targeting a gateway transferring CO2 from source to sink. The gateway will form the first leg of a cross-border network, allowing multiple sources and multiple sinks.
b) to make profound assessments of the substantial funding needs and available resources. 
c) to solicit strong actions by the partners involved (member states of the EU and other countries) with a three-step approach (Berlin model). 

The objectives will be ACHIEVED by acquiring commercial and legal input from various sources, such as industries, research alliances and institutes, investors and funding agencies, and engage industries capable of providing the knowledge of how to initiate the first gateway(s) of a future European CO2 transport system. This will include 
- knowledge gathering, involving structured intelligence processes, 
- outline strategies, 
- assessment of lead times, 
- scenario building, 
- consideration of funding synchronization issues. 
- assessing the economic potential(s), timing, and organisation towards the deployment of CCS within Europe, and gradually increase the deployment so that it applies to Europe as a whole, thus providing a Pan-European infrastructure for CO2 transport, 
- the initiation of a strict planning of the infrastructure, including the handling of specific policy issues and regulatory requirements. 

These objectives demonstrate a clear RELEVANCE to the H2020 Work Programme, calling for proposals for a pilot case addressing areas and challenges targeted in the competitive low-carbon energy call.

The project focuses on food practices as case studies of resilient actions and tests a hybrid platform in three European cities â€“ London, Paris and Bucharest. The research has three main objectives: 1) to examine the social, cultural, political and technological contexts for urban resilience, and map existing civic initiatives around resilient food practices in the three selected cities; 2) to co-design, prototype, test and refine open source digital platforms that could enable such civic initiatives to take place and/or expand, and enhance resilience capacities for citizens; and 3) to evaluate the capacity of these co-designed platforms to generate forms of public participation and urban governance that can stimulate actions of urban resilience. To address these objectives, the research will be carried out through design practice, through secondments within three professional practices working in the area of urban resilience, in the three elected cities. The methodology includes traditional qualitative methods (e.g., interviews), participatory action research, co-design experiments and collaborative workshops. The innovative and original aspects of EcoDA offer significant value in the context of the Horizon 2020 EU Programme, by addressing areas of special focus (e.g., sustainable food security and waste management) and key objectives (e.g. boosting industry engagement and supporting innovation). Moreover, the practice-based research approach, the open-source nature of the platform and the provision of the â€˜metadataâ€™ needed to enable the platform, will facilitate the up-scaling and up-taking of EcoDAâ€™s outcomes in various cities across Europe and possibly further away, thus enabling collaborations beyond the term of the project.",2015-10-01,2017-09-30,195454.8,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2

Fresh perspectives through spatial analyses and dendro-anthracology","To better anticipate global changes (environmental, climate and social changes), research over the past twenty years has focused on understanding and measuring the interactions between societies and their environment. Knowledge of past environments and their evolution in relation to society can help contribute to better manage, protect and anticipate present and future environments. 
This project adds to this dynamic research with a focus on forests. Forested landscapes represent the ecological inheritance of centuries of forest management to supply, among other products, the fuel necessary for human activities. Thus, to meet their demands for firewood past societies gradually modified and transformed the landscapes they inhabited. We focus here on the evolution of historical forests in the Euganean Hills (Colli Euganei, Padua-Italy) through wood charcoal production. Charcoal production is extremely polymorphic and fully understanding it requires the use of different approaches and disciplines (including history, ethnography, archaeology, geography, archaeobotany etc.) The aim of this project is to develop an integrated approach combining all disciplines to reconstruct forest landscapes on the Euganean Hills at different temporal and spatial scales. 
The choice of the Euganean Hills has been guided by its interesting biodiversity, by the numerous diachronic archaeological surveys previously undertaken, by the wealth of written and cartographic documentation concerning the uncultivated lands and also by the willingness of local actors to promote their region thanks to the richness of the landscape and its history. The project THISTLE aims to reconstitue the history of cultural landscapes, and more precisely of forest landscape of the Euganean Hills (Colli Euganei, Padua-Italie) with a pluridisciplinary approch in order to protect and promote them at different geographical scales (from local to global).",2016-04-01,2018-03-31,180277.2,['Fuel'],['forest management'],2,2

My group has challenged this view and used a systems biology approach to discover that the lysosome is subject to a global transcriptional regulation, is able to adapt to environmental clues, and acts as a signalling hub to regulate cell homeostasis. Furthermore, an emerging role of the lysosome has been identified in many types of diseases, including the common neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson's and Alzheimerâ€™s. These findings have opened entirely new fields of investigation on lysosomal biology, suggesting that there is a lot to be learned on the role of the lysosome in health and disease. The goal of LYSOSOMICS is to use â€œomicsâ€ approaches to study lysosomal function and its regulation in normal and pathological conditions. In this â€œorganellar systems biology projectâ€ we plan to perform several types of genetic perturbations in three widely used cell lines and study their effects on lysosomal function using a set of newly developed cellular phenotypic assays. Moreover, we plan to identify lysosomal protein-protein interactions using a novel High Content FRET-based approach. Finally, we will use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate a collection of cellular models for all lysosomal storage diseases, a group of severe inherited diseases often associated with early onset neurodegeneration. State-of-the-art computational approaches will be used to predict gene function and identify disease mechanisms potentially exploitable for therapeutic purposes. The physiological relevance of newly identified pathways will be validated by in vivo studies performed on selected genes by using medaka and mice as model systems.

However, their fragility and O2 sensitivity have been obstacles to their adoption in industry. We have recently proposed O2 quenching matrices for protecting intrinsically O2-sensitive catalysts for use in anodic (oxidative) processes. We have demonstrated that even hydrogenases, the highly sensitive metalloenzymes that oxidize H2, can be used under the harsh conditions encountered in operating fuel cells. However, attempts to reverse the concept for the protection of cathodic (reductive) processes, such as H2 evolution, have been unsuccessful so far. In this case, the electrode generates the reducing agents in the form of electrons, which are needed for both H2 generation and reductive O2 quenching. The competition between the two reactions results in insufficient protection from O2 and deactivation of the catalyst.
The objective is to design an alternative electron pathway that relies on H2 as a charge carrier to efficiently shuttle the reductive force to the matrix boundaries and quench the incoming O2. We will develop novel electron mediators with dual functionalities to enable the reversible H2/H\ interconversion and to achieve the complete reduction of O2 to water. We will focus on organic systems, as well as metal complexes based on Earth-abundant elements with tunable ligand spheres, to adjust their redox potentials for the desired direction of the electron flow and toward fast O2 reduction kinetics. The synthetic efforts will be supported by electrochemical modelling to predict the required properties of the redox matrix for efficient protection. After establishing the protection principle, we will demonstrate its practical use for implementing sensitive bio-catalysts for electrochemical H2 evolution under conditions relevant to energy conversion processes.",2017-03-01,2022-02-28,1483092.5,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,2
1008,703382,RES INV,Accommodate Renewable Energy in Interconnected Electricity System: an Economic Perspective,"The European Union (EU) has set ambitious greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) targets: 20% lower than 1990 levels by 2020, rising to 40% lower by 2030 and 85% lower by 2050. Moreover, a target of at least 27% on the share of renewable energy consumed in EU is set for 2030. To facilitate renewable integration, the EU is implementing the European Single Electricity Market (ESEM). The efficient use of electricity interconnection envisaged by the ESEM can mitigate the system instability caused by a high penetration of intermittent renewables; however the challenging targets on emissions and renewable generation add constraints that need to be evaluated.
In the first stage of my analysis, I will develop scenarios of the EU generation sector, focusing on the Italian market and the countries it shares electricity interconnection with. The goal is to investigate the role of investments in renewable generation and transmission network needed to meet the overall EU targets at minimum cost. I will then determine how the costs associated to interconnection and to investment in renewables are distributed among jurisdictions and between generators and consumers. 
In the second stage, I will investigate how the results of the first model change if electricity storage, the electrification of transport and electric heating are widely adopted. I will identify if demand management in the presence of these technologies help to match a supply that depends largely on renewable generation.",2016-09-01,2018-11-30,168277.2,['Storage'],['renewable energy'],2,2

In this concept, various 2nd generation agricultural, and forestry residue streams are converted into a liquid energy carrier near the biomass origin at an economic viable scale of 15-30 MWth using the fast pyrolysis process. Subsequently, the fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) is distributed to a large number of residential end-users. The FPBO should fulfill at least the draft CEN-specification for replacement of domestic heating oil and comply with REACH regulation. Additional quality control aspects for this application include the removal of extractives and solids from the FPBO. Ash is recovered from the fast pyrolysis process as a separate stream, and  recycling and/or re-use will be evaluated in detail. Existing high efficient, condensing boilers are used as starting point in the project, as well as a proven, low emission blue-flame type burner. Within Residue2Heat technical development work is performed on the modification of such systems to enable FPBO as fuel. The emission control and energy efficiency of the heating systems are optimized by dedicated modeling of FPBO atomization and combustion kinetics, supported by single droplet combustion tests and spray characterization. This route benefits from the flexible nature of the fast pyrolysis process, allowing the use of various lignocellulosic biomass streams, but also by using modified residential heating systems for which manufacturing capabilities, market development and product distribution are already in place. Dedicated tasks are included to assess the environmental and social impacts, risks analysis and public acceptance. Additionally, business and market assessment activities are performed including specific issues on health and safety relevant to FPBO-fuelled residential boilers.",2016-01-01,2019-12-31,5465728.0,['Fuel'],['recycling'],2,2

LEILAC will develop, build and operate a 240 tonne per day pilot plant demonstrating Direct Separation calcining technology which will capture over 95% of the process CO2 emissions (which is 60 % of total CO2 emissions) from both industries without significant energy or capital penalty.

Direct Separation technology uses indirect heating in which the process CO2 and furnace combustion gases do not mix, resulting in the simple capture of high quality CO2. This innovation requires minimal changes to the conventional processes for cement, replacing the calciner in the Preheater-Calciner Tower. For lime there is no product contamination from the combustion gas. The technology can be used with alternative fuels and other capture technologies to achieve negative CO2 emissions. The project will also enable research into novel building materials with a reduced CO2 footprint, as well the upgrade of low value limestone fines and dust to high value lime applications.

The high potential of the project is complemented by high deliverability. The requested grant will secure â‚¬8.8m of in-kind funding and support from the LEILAC consortium members, which include world leading engineering, cement, lime and R&D organisations. 

To accelerate further development, LEILAC will deliver a techno-economic roadmap, and comprehensive knowledge sharing activities including a visitor centre at the pilot site near Brussels. In order to reach the required 80% emissions reductions by 2050, CCS will need to be applied to 85% of European clinker production, and LEILAC is uniquely placed to allow Europe to achieve these targets in a timely, effective and efficient manner.",2016-01-01,2020-12-31,11932231.0,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,2

This technology provides an alternative to the use of expensive metal catalysts (such as platinum) and offers the ability for electrical energy to be produced under much milder conditions, such as near-neutral pH and room temperature. The cathodes of EBFCs usually employ O2 as the oxidant and final electron acceptor; this proposal seeks to utilise N2 in its place. Not only does the use of N2 as the oxidant circumvent issues relating to dissolved O2 concentrations and solubility (limited to less than 1 mM), but it also presents the possibility to produce industrially important NH3 (using a novel technology) whilst simultaneously producing electrical energy.",2015-06-01,2020-03-30,248063.4,['Fuel'],['electron acceptor'],2,2

The retrieval and validation for restricted domains and for an enlarged set of combined variables (user oriented) will be the basis to advance the state of the art in assimilation, modelling and applications, at a level commensurate with the new Sentinel capabilities. The project will address the multiple scales coexisting in littoral areas by developing new shallow water parameterizations, introducing them into coupled model suites (wind-wave-surge-current-land discharge) and producing new standards for coastal simulations and analyses. The permanent data base, with dynamic repositories, plus the modular structure of the developed models will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a future operational Copernicus coastal service.

Currently large generators powered by fossil fuel turbines maintain the stability and quality of energy supplies through their inertia.  The inertia of these generator-turbine groups gives providers a significant time window in which to react to network events.  We urgently need to find ways to stabilise energy systems with up to 100% RES (where inertia is often lost due to power converter mediated energy transfer) to generate â€œRE-SERVEsâ€ so that society can relax in the knowledge that it has a stable and sustainable energy supply.  
RE-SERVE will address this challenge by researching new energy system concepts, implemented as new system support services enabling distributed, multi-level control of the energy system using pan-European unified network connection codes.  Near real-time control of the distributed energy network will be enabled by innovative 5G based ICT.  Energy system use case scenarios supplied by energy providers will form the basis of energy system models.  Performance characteristics of the new control mechanisms will be investigated through integration of energy simulations and live 5G communications.  We will create a pan-European multi-site simulation test-bed, bringing together the best facilities in Europe.
RE-SERVE results include published models of system support services, innovative architectures for the implementation of the services, performance tests on our pan-European real-time simulation, and live, test-beds, a model for pan-European unified network connection codes and actions to promote results to standardisation organisations, all of which maintain the RE-SERVE in energy systems.

Within three years, they aim at validating the enabling role of DSOs in calling for flexibility sources according to local, time-varying merit orders. Demonstrations are designed to run 18 separate use cases involving one or several of the levers increasing the local energy system flexibility: energy storage technologies (electricity, heat, cold), demand response schemes with two coupling of networks (electricity and gas, electricity and heat/cold), the integration of grid users owning electric vehicles, and the further automation of grid operations including contributions of micro-grids.  The use cases are clustered into three groups. Three use cases in Sweden and the Czech Republic address the enhancement of the distribution network flexibility itself. Five use cases in France, Germany and Sweden demonstrate the role of IT solutions to increase drastically the speed of automation of the distribution networks, which can then make the best use of either local single or aggregated flexibilities. Ten use cases in Czech Republic, France, The Netherlands and Sweden combine an increased network automation and an increased level of aggregation to validate the plausibility of local flexibility markets where both distributed generation and controllable loads can be valued. Replicability of the results is studied by the DSOs and industry with an in-depth analysis of the interchangeability and interoperability of the tested critical technology components.

Climate changes and limited resources for farming lead to increased interest in new sources of nutrients alternative to meat. Additionally, human diet undergoes a significant shift towards proteins. Therefore, the growth of plant protein market is predicted to be drastically driven up in the coming years. Oilseeds, known for their high content of nutritious proteins, are expected to take center stage as main source of plant proteins aimed for human consumption. Nowadays, the main product of rapeseed processing is oil. A by-product â€“ rapeseed cake â€“ is used as animal feed. There is no commercial technology capable of extracting fully functional protein from rapeseed cake. At NapiFeryn BioTech (NFB) we came up with a new technology which allows more efficient use of this by-product. Our technology is protected with three patent applications. It enables full recovery of high-quality rapeseed cake proteins, ready to be used in food industry. Our business model is based on licensing of the technology to rapeseed processors. Licensing fee will be calculated individually for each oilseed processor or integrated formulator, based on the annual scale of the processed rapeseed. We have validated the pricing strategy with rapeseed processors. The first license agreement has been signed already in 2016. In the Ph2 project we aim primarily at delivering full-scale demonstrator (TRL9) of the rapeseed protein isolation technology at the commercial level (market launch), collect and prove all the data needed to quantify the cost-effectiveness of our technology. These activities will provide the input required for the main deliverables of the project: The Basic Engineering Level design of Biorefinery.

However, 83% of industrial process heat is still supplied by inefficient and polluting fossil fuel boilers. The Highlift project will develop a next-generation high temperature heat pump (HTHP) based on an innovative 4-cylinder alpha configuration Stirling engine design. Highlift accepts low temperature (30Â´C) input water drawn from industrial waste heat recapture systems and use electrical energy to generate saturated steam at over 180Â´C. Such temperature lifts are not possible with any other HTHP today. The Highlift project optimises the industrial design via 1) increased system efficiency, 2) improved reliability, 3) 30% cut on production costs, 4) refined production quality control, and 5) improved Cloud-based operating system. We will pilot the near-market prototype at a single high-profile multinational industrial end user with high demands in terms of constant, intensive operation and high output temperature requirements. The project will simultaneously undertake a market maturation process including up- and downstream supply chain development, in-depth target market analyses, and validation of the business and commercialisation strategy. This will bring the HighLift technology to full commercial readiness at the end of the project.  Over 25,000 hours of tests with industry since 2012 have shown that it is feasible to use Highlift to generate hot industrial process steam in an economic and environmentally sustainable way. Highlift reduces energy consumption to supply high temperature process heat by 50-70% and will cut industrial CO2 emissions when producing high temperature steam by 70-96%.

1018,744281,ToSubC,Towards Submarine Landslides and Their Consequences,"The last decade has witnessed a boom in offshore infrastructures, including not only oil and gas platforms and submarine pipelines due to the shift of energy exploration from onshore to offshore but also offshore wind farms, offshore electricity grid infrastructure, and submarine communication cables and routes. This boom significantly enhances the importance of the estimation of potential submarine landslides and their consequences. It is true that submarine landslides may have a unexpectedly long travel distance and damage infrastructure thousands of kilometers away. However numerical modelling of the entire process of submarine landslides is a long-standing challenge. In addition to constitutive models for describing both solid-like and fluid-like behaviour of sediments, it requires also advanced numerical approaches capable of tackling extremely large deformation experienced by materials as well as interactions between structures, seawater, and sediments. This project is motivated by these challenges and aims to develop innovative continuum models and numerical approaches for simulating submarine landslides and their consequences. A unified mixed Lagrangian finite element formulation will be derived for handling solid mechanics (infrastructure), fluid dynamics (seawater), and poromechanics (sediments). Viscoeplastoplastic constitutive models will be developed for capturing the solid-fluid transitional behaviour of sediments. The proposed formulation and models will be implemented on a high performance computing based numerical platform within the framework of the particle finite element method for fully coupled analyses of submarine landslides. The intended outcome is a computational tool that can simulate the complete process of real-world submarine landslides, ranging from the initiation of failure through the sliding process to the final deposition and predicting their impact on offshore infrastructures.",2017-08-01,2019-07-31,170121.6,['Wind'],['offshore wind'],2,2

The project will provide reductions in utilization of fossil resources of 80-100%, and energy utilization and CO2 emissions above 30%.
Specifically, building blocks (1,4 and 2,3-Butanediol, estherpolyols), materials (PUs, phenolic resins, modified hydrolysis lignin) and products (wooden boards, insulation foams, cement, adhesive) will be obtained:
â€¢ Isolation of tannins and carbohydrates from forestry waste to turn them into bio-phenolic resins for wooden panels and isocyanate-free polyurethanes (PU) for insulating foams, respectively.
â€¢ Isolation of lignin and carbohydrates from agricultural waste to turn them into bio-phenolic resins for wooden panels and biosuperplasticizers for cement, and estherpolyol PU for adhesives, respectively.

The galenic formulation will consist of drug loaded biodegradable polymer particles (e.g., chitosan, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) embedded into a biodegradable hydrogel matrix (e.g., hyaluronic acid (HA)-based) to be deposited as a patch onto the olfactory region. A pH-sensitive, mucoadhesive particle coating (e.g., chitosan, chitosan derivatives) will ensure an environment-specific adhesion to the olfactory epithelium. This novel technology will largely enhance the controlled and sustainable delivery of drugs and increase the drug bioavailabilty to the CNS. NogoA antagonist NG-101 will be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Proof of concept studies and initial clinical data have proven the enormous potential of blocking NogoA for spinal cord remyelation and axonal integrity. However, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) like NG-101, do not sufficiently cross the BBB. The sustainable and controlled release of NG-101 to the CNS will be achieved via the transport of embedded polymer particles to the olfactory epithelium, the subsequent release of API and permeation through the olfactory region, the only part of the nasal epithelium which is in direct contact with the brain. The direct transport route from the nasal cavity to the brain, bypassing the BBB, offers an exciting mode of central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery not only for demyelinating disorders but also for other CNS indications, e.g., stroke, neurodegenerative diseases or tumours.

1026,818368,MASTER,Microbiome Applications for Sustainable food systems through Technologies and EnteRprise,"Although microorganisms dominate almost every ecological niche in our planet, it has only been during the past 10-15 years that we have begun to gain insights into the composition and function of microbial communities (microbiomes) as a consequence of major advances in High Throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies. These approaches have allowed a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes for the first time. Following initial curiosity-driven investigations of microbiomes using HTS technologies, the field has evolved to harness the insights provided, leading to the development of a new multi-billion euro industry focused on characterisation and modulation of microbiomes. The vast majority of this investment has been in the clinical space. In contrast, far less is known about microbiomes across complex food chains, making it difficult to harness food-chain microbiome data for the development of more sustainable food systems and to yield innovative products and applications. This is despite the evident importance of microbes throughout the food chain. MASTER will take a global approach to the development of concrete microbiome products, foods/feeds, services  or processes with high commercial potential, which will benefit society through improving the quantity, quality and safety of food, across multiple food chains, to include marine, plant, soil, rumen, meat, brewing, vegetable waste, and fermented foods. This will be achieved through mining microbiome data relating to the food chain, developing big data management tools to identify inter-relations between microbiomes across food chains, and generating applications which promote sustainability, circularity and contribute to waste management and climate change mitigation. We will harness microbiome knowledge to significantly enhance the health and resilience of fish, plants, soil, animals and humans, improve professional skills and competencies, and support the creation of new jobs in the food sector and bioeconomy.",2019-01-02,2023-01-01,10950171.9,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2

All EU countries will have to abide by new regulations (already implemented in Germany, Denmark and UK, other EU member states have to follow until 2030) which fix particulate matter (PM) emission limits under 20 mg/m3. Today no cost effective solutions exist that comply with the legislation. The CYCLOMB system achieves a 96-99% PM emission reduction, combining flue gas recycling and cyclone variable geometry. Recirculation of flue gases provides the biomass boiler with a high combustion efficiency (up to 95%) and reduces boiler emissions from 150 mg/m3 of typical automatic boilers to 80 mg/m3. By using a variable-geometry design of the attached PM abatement device a â‰¥96-99% particulate matter reduction is achieved. Final emission levels are always lower than 20 mg/m3 while investing only an additional 26% in PM abatement technology with respect to boiler price. It thus provides a comparative performance to the most advanced electrostatic precipitators and bag filters but at a 66% lower cost. The total annual operation and maintenance cost of biomass power plants is typically 5%-6.5% of the capital cost of small and medium capacity power plants. The implementation of CYCLOMB can reduce these maintenance costs at least 80% The PM abatement cyclone-technology solution will be optimized for the CYCLOMB integrated solution medium-scale range (200kW-5MW) ideal for medium scale district heating plants and applications in the primary sector (farms, greenhouses) and the tertiary sector (office buildings, schools, hospitals and hotels).",2017-04-01,2019-03-31,1241826.26,,"['district heating', 'recycling']",2,2

The project will design  wireless networks, composed by smart nodes, which are able to perform the following tasks:â€¨
	1) Â Self-configure, autonomously allocating their own physical layer radio resources through energy-efficient, feedback-aware, and complexity-aware radio resource allocation.

	2) Â Self-sustain by harvesting energy from renewable and intermittent energy sources, such as solar and wind, as well as from dedicated radio frequency signals present over the air.	

             3) Â Sharing or trading energy with other network nodes in order to prolong the lifetime of nodes which are low on battery and to obtain a more fair energy distribution across the whole network.â€¨
The long-term vision of the project is to kick-start a paradigm shift from core-centric, throughput-optimized networks, towards device-centric, energy-optimized networks. The development of autonomous, energy-independent, and self-organizing wireless networks will enable: 

         a) 100% coverage in urban environments in a power efficient manner;

         b) network coverage in remote/developing areas where currently it is commercially unattractive to do so. 

These advancements will make the vision of a connected society sustainable, almost zeroing the operational expenses related to power and hence revolutionizing the business models for ICT by radically reducing energy costs.

Moreover, we could monitor fluid flow in aquifers, geothermal reservoirs or CO2 storage reservoirs, with unprecedented resolution. Unfortunately, placing seismic instruments anywhere below the ground is not practically feasible. 

I propose to develop groundbreaking methodology for creating virtual seismic sources (earthquakes or seismic vibrators) and virtual seismometers anywhere in the subsurface, from seismic reflection measurements carried out at the surface of the earth. I call this Virtual Seismology (VS). VS accurately mimics the responses to actual earthquakes that would be recorded by actual buried seismometers, including all multiple scattering effects.

In particular I will develop VS for:
(1) Investigating induced-earthquake problems. (a) I will develop high-density multi-component seismic acquisition methodology, using the latest technology of controllable seismic vibrators and seismic sensing with fibre-optic cables, and apply it in an actual induced-earthquake sensitive area. (b) I will use these data to create virtual sources and receivers in the subsurface to characterize induced earthquakes, quantify the ground motion of actual and possible future earthquakes, and monitor the geomechanical state of the area over time.
(2) Imaging and monitoring subsurface fluid flow. I will develop highly repeatable VS methodology for time-lapse 3D reflection data to monitor fluid-flow processes in the subsurface with excellent spatial and temporal resolution.

1045,802918,DUNES,"Sea, Sand and People. An Environmental History of Coastal Dunes","Dunes are now protected environments, being top priority for coastal managers, because of their important role as coastal defences. But, it was not like that in the past.
For centuries dunes were considered unproductive and dangerous. The sand blown by the wind was taken inland, invading fields, silting rivers and destroying villages. In the eighteenth century, a strategy was developed to fight against the dunes: trapping them with trees, with the double purpose of preventing the destruction of arable land and increasing their economic value converting them into forest areas. Different governments, in different countries supported the immobilization of the shifting sands. The strategy, developed in Europe, was taken to other places in the world. These works caused profound changes in vast coastal areas transforming arid landscapes of sandy dunes into green tree forests. 
This project aims to explore human-environment relations in coastal areas worldwide, since the eighteenth century until today, through the study of dunes as hybrid landscapes. Based on selected case-studies and comparative approaches, the project will focus on the origins, reasons and means of dunes afforestation; the impacts of the creation of new landscapes to local communities and ecosystems; and the present situation of dunes as coastal defences and rehabilitated environments. The final purpose is to produce an innovative global history of coastal dunes, combining knowledges from both Humanities and Social Sciences and Physical and Life Sciences, which has never been done.
Supported by an interdisciplinary team, this research will result in new developments in the field of the Environmental History studies; provide relevant knowledge considering the need of efficient management solutions to adapt to the expected mean sea level rise; and stimulate environmental citizenship by disseminating the idea that the future of the world coasts depends on todayâ€™s actions.",2018-11-01,2023-10-31,1062330.0,['Wind'],['afforestation'],2,2
1046,824290,SELFIE,SELF-sustained and Smart Battery Thermal Management SolutIon for Battery Electric Vehicles,"Strong efforts would be required to drastically reduce the fossil dependency and the CO2 emissions reductions in the transport sector, in line with the 2011 White paper on Transport â€“ i.e. a 20% reduction in the CO2 emissions by 2030 (relative to 2008 levels) and a 60% reduction by 2050 (relative to 1990 levels). Electrification of the transport sector offers EU the opportunity to achieve these long term targets. The larger automotive industry have recognized the potential of electric vehicles (EVs) and there are large strides planned in building electric charging infrastructure â€“ as announced by E.ON and Ionity about their investment plans for ultra-fast charging infrastructure. Right now, thereâ€™s no EV that can accept this charge rate, but several automakers are working on electric cars able to accept that kind of power. SELFIE makes its biggest impact here, ensuring that the EVs, in the not so distant future, are able to accept this high charge rate without reduction on battery lifetime, and to store the energy efficiently in their batteries with minimal losses.

The overall objective is to develop and demonstrate a novel self-sustained compact battery system, consisting of: 
-	A smart modular battery pack, which has excellent internal thermal conductivity properties, a refrigerant cooling system and thermal storage system (heat buffer) capable to absorb excess heat due to fast charging, and which is thoroughly insulated from the outside; 
-	An advanced battery thermal management system capable to keep the battery temperature effectively within the optimal window and to prevent overheating (and battery degradation) due to fast charging. 

SELFIE will significantly increase user acceptance of EVs by enabling fast-charging; offering significant cost reductions and elimination of range anxiety compared to other propulsion technologies.",2018-12-01,2022-05-31,4999455.13,['Storage'],['thermal storage'],2,2

Sustainable aquaculture is undoubtedly the management technique that has most contributed to support aquaculture businesses to adopt aqua-environmental measures for protection of the environment, natural resources and landscape.
Aquaponics is known as a sustainable production system for plants and fish that combines traditional aquaculture (aquatic livestock), such as fish, crayfish and shrimp with the hydroponics (growing plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. The Aquaponics is a production system where the waste is utilized as nutrients is a system sustainable for the environment, where high-value products on the market are obtained because they are grown with organic nutrients and free of chemicals or pesticides.
By this research project, we aim at to improving onboard waste management and reduce the amount of waste disposed of inappropriately. In order to achieve this goal, we have the following objectives: to integrate aquaculture production system with agricultural production system (aquaponics) and to reconcile and achieve social, economic and environmental objectives with processing and marketing action to add more value to end aquaponics products.

I will also investigate the formation mechanisms of the organic mesocrystals, and influence of the different additives on these processes. The low dissolution rate and poor aqueous solubility of emerging new drug candidates limit the formulation approaches, clinical application, and marketability in pharmaceutical industry. The preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in the form of mesocrystals can enhance the dissolution rate suitable for drug delivery. The voids between highly oriented nanocrystals and high surface area of hierarchical structure in the non-classical pathway of mesocrystals formation play a role in the process. Different additives can be used to control the self-assembly of particles so that avoiding mesocrystals fusion into single crystals. A suitable additive can be screened through density functional theory calculations. The microstructure of mesocrystals and its transformation and particle growth can be investigated through time-dependent experiments using SEM, TEM and laser diffraction particle size analyser. Computed Tomography will be used for the first time to obtain the density mapping of mesocrystals surface in phase contrast mode. The dissolution rates and solubility of the mesocrystals are characterized and compared to its single crystals. The feasibility of drug dissolution will be investigated through in vitro studies.

1054,803024,MIDNP,Metal Ions Dynamic Nuclear Polarization: Novel Route for Probing Functional Materials with Sensitivity and Selectivity,"Materials with specific electrical, optical or chemical properties often derive their special functions from small perturbations in their composition or structure. Thus, rational design of new functional materials demands sensitive and versatile determination of structural and compositional properties, a very difficult goal not presently available. The overarching goal of this ERC project is to develop a novel route for Magic-Angle Spinning Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (MAS-DNP) as an enabling methodology in materials science, introducing new opportunities for investigating and designing functional materials.
Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy is an excellent probe for local order/disorder, but unfortunately its sensitivity is limited.  DNP, a process whereby the large electron spin polarization is transferred to the nuclear spins, had greatly expanded the range of materials systems and questions that can be probed by ssNMR. However, it commonly relies on the use of exogenous nitroxide radicals, thereby limiting its utilization in materials science to nonreactive surfaces. 
We propose to develop Metal Ions DNP (MIDNP) utilizing paramagnetic dopants as endogenous polarization agents in the bulk.  To effectively harness the electron spin polarization of the dopants for higher sensitivity, we will (a) address challenges such as the effect of bonding, spin interactions and relaxation on DNP via a mechanistic study of carefully selected dopants in energy materials; (b) Develop new techniques for NMR spectral assignment and explore alternative DNP mechanisms for paramagnetic solids; (c) Expand the approach for sensitizing the detection of surfaces and interfaces and elucidate the critical role of surface chemistry in the efficacy of energy storage materials.
MIDNP will provide a novel, sensitive alternative for probing the structure and composition of new materials and will transform the utilization of ssNMR in the study of functional materials.",2019-01-01,2023-12-31,1700000.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2

The main focus will be on exchange of material (waste and by-products) and non-material based resources (knowledge and transferable skills) via international as well as intersectoral mobility between Africa and Europe. Methodologically, it draws on a case study of high volumes of underused by-products and wastes from banana production in Uganda and the environmentally toxic cheese whey produced by Cyprus dairies. Compared to other regions, whey from Cypriot dairies presents high lactose content and therefore great potential for product-driven biorefining. Moreover, banana flavour is one of the most preferred flavours in dairy products.

1056,646827,NOVCARBFIX,"Analysis, Design and Experimental Evolution of Novel Carbon Fixation Pathways","Carbon fixation is a prerequisite for accumulating biomass and storing energy in most of the living world. As such, it supplies our food and dominates land and water usage by humanity. In agriculture, where water and nutrients are abundant, the rate of carbon fixation often limits growth rate. Therefore increasing the rate of carbon fixation is of global importance towards agricultural and energetic sustainability.
What are the limits on the possible rate of carbon fixation? Attempts to improve RuBisCO, the key enzyme in the Calvin-Benson cycle, have achieved only limited results. My lab focuses on trying to overcome this global challenge by building synthetic pathways for carbon fixation. We create a computational framework that designs and scores pathways and creates step-wise selection strategies for in-vivo experimental implementation. Our most promising synthetic carbon fixation pathways are found to utilize the highly effective carboxylating enzyme, PEP carboxylase. We experimentally test these pathways in the most genetically tractable context by constructing an E.coli strain that depends on atmospheric CO2 fixation. We will gradually incorporate the pathways, initially as essential reaction steps for biomass production, and finally with CO2 as sole carbon input of the cell.
As a stepping-stone towards this challenging goal, we will construct an autotrophic E.coli strain that uses the Calvin-Benson cycle. We systematically convert this synthetic biology grand challenge into a gradual evolutionary ladder with independently selectable steps. We recently achieved key steps in the ladder, such as semi-autotrophic growth, serving as powerful proofs of concept.
The proposed research will advance our basic-science understanding of evolutionary plasticity of metabolic pathways. It also paves the way for a hybrid rational-design/experimental-evolution approach to revisit and advance the capacity of metabolism for agricultural productivity and renewable energy storage.",2016-01-01,2020-12-31,1999843.0,['Storage'],['renewable energy'],2,2

The inherent high-risk of 2D-INK is countered by a strongly interdisciplinary research team composed of 9 partners (8 academics \ 1 SME) with demonstrated experience in their corresponding fields and with different yet highly complementary backgrounds. Therefore only together and in synergy they will be able to address the challenges of the multiple research and innovation aspects of 2D-INK that cover the entire value chain from materials design and synthesis, characterisation, formulation and processing to device implementation. 
In addition 2D-INK has the potential to revolutionise research on 2D semiconducting materials way beyond the current interests on synthesis (high impact), since the efficient dispersion and formulation of 2D semiconducting materials into inks enables the applications of 2D semiconducting materials over different scientific and technological disciplines, such as electronics, sensing, photonics, energy storage and conversion, spintronics, etc.

One aspect of batteries that has received little attention so far, is the form factor of the electrodes. However, simple changes in the battery architecture, such as increasing the coating thickness, allows to drastically decrease the relative fraction of dead volume in the battery (e.g. separators and current collectors). Theoretically, it is possible to replace a stack of ten standard 50 Âµm thick electrode coatings by one 500 Âµm thick coating. This would result in up to 30% savings in weight as well as volume of the battery, and would be transformative for both portable electronics and electrical vehicles. However, this is fundamentally challenging because of 1) slow ion diffusion through thick electrodes, 2) high electric resistance through the thickness of the electrode, and 3) cracking and flaking challenges during the fabrication of thick electrodes.

A major challenge for the research community, therefore, is to find effective (policy) solutions for addressing the environmental and health problems caused by E-waste management in low and mid-income countries while, at the same time, enhancing the recovery of precious metals to reuse these resources. During my Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie fellowship, I will analyse why emerging economies adopt E-waste policies that seem inadequate and ineffective in their local contexts and identify alternative approaches. In a first step, I will develop a novel analytical framework to analyse the effectiveness of E-waste policies in emerging economies and, as a second step, I will seek to explain the degree of effectiveness of E-waste policies in India and South Africa. The research aims to make conceptual, empirical and policy-relevant contributions: I strive to contribute to the academic literature by developing a novel analytical framework that helps evaluate E-waste policies in non-Western countries. Current literature on E-waste is largely based on assumptions derived from Western policies, polities and societies. By analysing the cases of India and South Africa, my research will focus on two countries whose E-waste policy has hardly been analysed.

The two main features of HyCool System are Flexibility and Efficiency an they will allow different strategies for a technically and economically viable system. During Capital Expeditures phase simplicity will be aimed pursuing easiness in design configuration optimization, modular construction and ITS for commissioning. During Operational Expenditures the optimum balance between the HyCool System Operational Flexibility and Efficiency will be targeted to maximize HyCool cost effectiveness to each individual case. Following this, the pilots proposed will demonstrate both opposed strategies in two selected key leading industry sectors: 

Food Case Pilot targets specialized small Food industries in high solar irradiation areas with cooling needs in their processes. Here narrow configurations are aimed to optimize Efficiency, so a simple system will be selected to obtain maximum outputs based on the conditions of use.

Chemical Case Pilot target industries with several processes in high solar irradiation areas with steam and cooling needs. Here a more complex configuration is aimed to optimize Operational Flexibility, so a more complex system will be implemented, able to be switched among different options based on weather, season and production schedule.

It arises from a joint business venture between Solarbox Solar Solutions and Generaciones Fotovoltaicas de la Mancha (GFM), which started in 2007 for the development of a solar tracker to increase the collection efficiency of solar systems by more than 35% whilst making it easy to transport to cover the lack of solutions in the market with good price/characteristics rate.  Suninbox features will allow both Solarbox and GFM to gradually reach industrial scale with increasingly lower costs (objective price of 4.25 â‚¬/W per 12kWn module), gaining penetration in the international market through a lower cost of energy (i.e. <35â‚¬/kWh) vs. other off â€“ grid solutions ( <0,56E/kWh for generation with diesel). It will open for both companies a new business line, which will double their turnover by achieving over 5 million â‚¬ in the first five years after commercialization. Main challenges to address are the requirements of electricity generation in off-grid areas are to decrease use of fossil fuel, while guaranteeing continuous energy supply of demand, to lower operational and maintenance costs and to introduce low cost standalone systems that are portable and easy to install, to facilitate transport and use. Suninbox has demonstrated, and an in depth-feasibility study has also been financed by the SME Instrument Phase 1, where we determined Suninbox's business opportunities in different market niches, studied how to reach them and detailed how to perform technical optimisation of the solution.

The objective of this business innovation propoject have been defined to reach the overall goal: to succesful launch the Conductive Fast Charge System for buses. Heliox' Conductive Fast Charge system is designed for opportunity charging at e.g. end of bus line, extending the range of an (H)EV. A minimal onboard energy storage, enough to reach the next charging station, becomes practically sufficient to optimally operate a vehicle with low TCO and high availability. Potential users are: public transport operators and European bus manufacturers. Based on rigourus studies and feasibility assessments, conducted under the SME Phase 1 project (number 650507), Heliox developed a solid business plan that incorporates a commercialization strategy and a financing plan to underpin the forseeen market launch and growth strategy of the system.
The Company has already piloted its Product Generation 1 in a real environment and has established strong relationships with several Northern European city bus services and continues to initiate relationships with potential customers public transport operators and European bus manufacturers.
Product readiness: The Product Generation 1 is between TRL 7 and TRL 8 with 8 units sold and 15 more in the pipeline to be sold for piloting purposes. Generation 2 is at TRL 6 and moving towards TRL 7.

In order to make best use of lessons learned and available resources, this project jointly works on two distinguished technologies (PEFC&SOFC) in two different markets (residential & extended UPS). Both SME manufacturers are committed to establish lean after-sales structures, a significant step towards mass manufacturing and deployment. Maintenance is one significant part of Total Cost of Ownership of FC systems.
Pooling the operational experience of field test programs, such as ene.field and Callux, critical analysis will lead to a priority list of required technical changes. For cold Balance of Plant Components, joint efforts will focus on the desulphuriser and the water treatment system. Actions are taken for both, simplified maintenance and extended durability for prolonged service intervals. Logistics for replacement component supply will be considered. For the hot component parts, the manufacturers work on their individual hot topics to adapt and simplify the design of the current units, e.g. to allow replacement of individual components instead of sub-units. A large decrease of costs impact is expected once individual stacks can be changed in a simple maintenance operation instead of complete sub-units. It is important that such operations can be performed by a significant pool of qualified installers. This is addressed by the elaboration of simple technical manuals that will be exposed to real-life practical technicians in training programs. These actions aim at decreasing the technical barrier to service systems. 
Finally, the improved BoP units will be validated by testing single and multiple units. Beyond the classical features of high efficiency and silent operation, this will also add values like flexibility and modularity of FC technologies with respect to individual customer requests.",2015-09-01,2019-11-30,2953790.75,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,2
1071,680511,DREEAM,Demonstration of an integrated Renovation approach for Energy Efficiency At the Multi building scale,"DREEAM aims to demonstrate replicable Net Zero Energy residential building renovation approaches achieving 75% total Net Energy Demand reduction- an improvement of 60% to state of the art market practices. It will utilise packages of interconnected energy systems that achieve a balance between energy efficiency and renewable energy measures. This is enabled by enhancing renewable technologies capacity factors by using advanced building management systems with machine learning algorithms that allow building system integration and auto-optimisation across building dimensions. 

Currently, deep energy renovations mainly focus on building-level solutions, where, cost-effectively, an energy demand reduction of 40-50% can be achieved. In district scale projects, technologies for energy generation, storage and management can be integrated cost-effectively, reducing up to an additional 25-35% of Net Energy Demand. Multi-owner complexities and need for tailored system integration make this approach location-specific and hard to replicate. A focus on multi-building, single owner situations seeks the appropriate balance for both high energy demand reduction and high market replication potential. Energy Load Management technologies (ICT based building systems management) and services that are successfully piloted in commercial buildings will be adapted to enable this approach.

The approach is a breakthrough in reaching widely applicable and replicable pathways for near-NZEB residential building renovation, in particular for social and public housing, which accounts for 12% of European stock, or 25 million units. 

Building owners that jointly own 160,000 dwellings, energy service engineers and finance experts collaborate to demonstrate the DREEAM approach in 3 climatologically different locations, and initiate replication in 15 more locations within the project duration.

1073,644026,ALABO,Advanced laser ablation barrier films for organic and large area electronic devices,"The overall objective of this project is developing organic electronic building elements on flexible substrates with monolithically integrated barrier foils as substrate. The barrier acts as the inevitable protection against atmospheric gases as water vapor and oxygen, as the most crucial agents for unwanted material degradation processes. This topic is one of the keys for enhancing both the performance of TOLAE components and addresses some of the main technology barriers of TOLAE: lifetime and cost-performance-ratio.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules have been chosen as test objects for a scalable and general approach suitable also for other TOLAE devices. Monolithical integration of barrier foils means in this case that the full device is made immediately on top of ultra-barrier coated plastic foil, which further is coated with a transparent electrode. This leads to significant cost reduction, which is one of the key needs for wider use of TOLAE devices.
The project ALABO develops direct laser scribing processes on flexible substrates, coated with ultra-barrier systems. The project results will be applicable to a number of TOLAE technologies, such as OPV, OLED, OTFT and thin-film inorganic PV on polymer foil substrates. The consortium will investigate and develop new manufacturing processes, which will increase the performance and functionality of TOLAE devices suitable for smart systems. OPV can be part of such smart TOLAE systems. By developing direct laser structuring on top of such ultra-barrier foil, the consortium develops advanced materials, as well as new production technologies supported by dedicated monitoring and material testing technologies for well-scalable manufacturing processes. As an outcome, more functionality will be integrated into less material, since in - contrast to state-of-the-art encapsulation processes - the devices will need only one foil per side, instead of at least two today.",2015-01-01,2017-12-31,3937270.0,,"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",2,2

The INREP philosophy is to meet this challenge by addressing the whole value chain via an application focused research programme aiming at developing tailor made solutions for each targeted application.
This programme will produce a complete evaluation of the relevant properties of the proposed TCOs, including the impact of deposition technique, and by doing so, devise optimum processes for their application in selected, high value application areas.  The selected application areas are organic and inorganic light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells and touchscreens.  The physical properties of interest are the transparency, electrical conductivity, work function, texture, and chemical and thermal stability.
To reach its overall goal, INREP brings together industrial and academic experts in TCOs, the technology and processes for their deposition and their applications in a concerted research programme that will result in the creation of TCOs and deposition technologies with the optimum opto-electrical properties suitable for the economic and safe manufacture of the specified photonic or opto-electronic components.

The Europe 2020 strategy calls for a Bioeconomy as a key element for smart and green growth in Europe. However, the complex inter-dependencies that exist between challenges can lead to trade-offs, such as the controversy about competing uses of biomass. The latter arose from concerns about the potential impact of the growing demand for renewable biological resources by other sectors on food security, the use of scare natural resources and the environment in Europe and third countries. 

On 13th of February 2012 the EU launched the Bioeconomy strategy and action plan on 'Innovating for Sustainable Growth: a Bioeconomy for Europe', which aims to pave the way to a more innovative, resource efficient and competitive society that reconciles food security with the sustainable use of renewable resources for industrial purposes, while ensuring environmental protection.

In this respect the Strategy stresses that participatory models are needed that engage citizens and end-users in order to reinforce the relationship between science, society and policy making. More informed dialogues will in fact allow science and innovation to provide a sound basis for policy making and informed societal choices by taking into account legitimate societal concerns and needs in the Bioeconomy.

In this framework, and in support of the review and implementation of the strategy, this 4th Bioeconomy Stakeholders Conference on April 12-13 2016 will provided opportunity for public awareness raising and for an informed dialogue on the progress of the Bioeconomy, involving researchers, stakeholders, policy makers and the civil society at large across the whole Bioeconomy value chain.

By the according energy consumption of 74 000 GWh/a the potential 10% savings amount to 7 400 GWh/a. Currently, there is neither a benchmark on the energy consumption in industrial water circuits, nor tools for its systematic reduction, nor awareness of the saving potential. The WaterWatt project aims to remove market barriers for energy efficient solutions, in particular the lack of expertise and information on energy management and saving potential in industrial water circuits. The aims will be achieved through: i) case studies in relevant industries, ii) development of improvement measures for energy efficiency in industrial water circuits, iii) market studies, iv) capacity building activities and v) dissemination in workshops and by e-learning. An Energy Efficiency Evaluation Platform (E3 Platform) will be developed to disseminate knowledge/know-how on energy efficiency improvements using gaming approach. The tools of EÂ³ Platform will be used by SMEs and large industrial producers for self-assessment and improvement of the energy efficiency in their circuits.  WaterWatt will reach more than 2000 relevant persons, organisations and policy makers triggering investments of â‚¬7-12 million resulting in primary energy saving of 100-180 GWh/a during the project life-time. The planned spin-off company will ensure further investments and savings after the project has finished.",2016-04-01,2019-03-31,1782532.5,['Energy management'],['recycling'],2,2
1083,645323,BISON,BIg Speech data analytics for cONtact centres,"Contact centers (CC) are an important business for Europe: 35,000 contact centers generate 3.2 Million jobs (~1% of Europeâ€™s active population). A typical CC produces a wealth of multilingual spoken data that is nowadays mined by humans (CC agents  and supervisors) or by rudimentary technical means.

BISON consortium plans to bring significant innovations in three areas: (1) basic speech data mining technologies (systems quickly adaptable to new languages, domains and CC campaigns), (2) business outcome mining from speech (translated into improvement of CCsâ€™ Key Performance Indicators) and (3) CC support systems integrating both speech and business outcome mining in user-friendly way.

The project will produce two prototypes: smallBison (end of the 1st year) will be a functioning system for real, though limited, deployment and user feedback collection. bigBison (end of the project) will include full range of capabilities and be fully integrated with CC hardware and software infrastructure. Generation of business outputs will be demonstrated on real data.

Business indicators and values for the market were instrumental for the definition of the project and will be crucial for project execution.

BISON consortium is composed of eight players with complementary skills. Two end users running large CC operations (EBOS, Atento) are generating user requirements and are ready to deploy the prototypes immediately in real scenarios. Phonexia (the coordinator), Brno University of Technology and TelefÃ³nica I\D are experts in speech data mining - from R&D, data processing to developing products placed on the market.

1084,686116,OptiNanoPro,"Processing and control of novel nanomaterials in packaging, automotive and solar panel processing lines","Nanocomposites are promising for many sectors, as they can make polymers stronger, less water and gas permeable, tune surface properties, add functionalities such as antimicrobial effects. In spite of intensive research activities, significant efforts are still needed to deploy the full potential of nanotechnology in the industry. The main challenge is still obtaining a proper nanostructuring of the nanoparticles, especially when transferring it to industrial scale, further improvements are clearly needed in terms of processing and control.

The OptiNanoPro project will develop different approaches for the introduction of nanotechnology into packaging, automotive and photovoltaic materials production lines. In particular, the project will focus on the development and industrial integration of tailored online dispersion and monitoring systems to ensure a constant quality of delivered materials. In terms of improved functionalities, nanotechnology can provide packaging with improved barrier properties as well as repellent properties resulting in easy-to-empty features that will on the one hand reduce wastes at consumer level and, on the other hand, improve their acceptability by recyclers. Likewise, solar panels can be self-cleaning to increase their effectiveness and extend the period between their maintenance and their lifetime by filtering UV light leading to material weathering. In the automotive sector, lightweight parts can be obtained for greater fuel efficiency.

To this end, a group of end-user industries from Europe covering the supply and value chain of the 3 target sectors and using a range of converting processes such as coating and lamination, compounding, injection/co-injection and electrospray nanodeposition, supported by selected RTDs and number of technological SMEs, will work together on integrating new nanotechnologies in existing production lines, while also taking into account nanosafety, environmental, productivity and cost-effectiveness issues.",2015-10-01,2018-09-30,5516910.0,['Fuel'],['photovoltaic'],2,2

1086,636876,REDMUD,European Training Network for Zero-waste Valorisation of Bauxite Residue (Red Mud),"To tackle its (critical) raw material dependency, Europe needs comprehensive strategies based on sustainable primary mining, substitution and recycling. Freshly produced flows and stocks of landfilled industrial residues such as mine tailings, non-ferrous slag and bauxite residue (BR) can provide major amounts of critical metals and, concurrently, minerals for low-carbon building materials. The European Training Network for Zero-Waste Valorisation of Bauxite Residue (REDMUD) therefore targets the vast streams of new and stockpiled BR in the EU-28. BR contains several critical metals, is associated with a substantial management cost, whereas spills have led to major environmental incidents, including the Ajka disaster in Hungary. To date, zero-waste valorisation of BR is not occurring yet. The creation of a zero-waste BR valorisation industry in Europe urgently requires skilled scientists and engineers, who can tackle the barriers to develop fully closed-loop environmentally-friendly recovery flow sheets. REDMUD trains 15 researchers in the S/T of bauxite residue valorisation, with emphasis on the recovery of Fe, Al, Ti and rare earths (incl. Sc) while valorising the residuals into building materials. An intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration of EU-leading institutes and scientists has been established, which covers the full value chain, from BR to recovered metals and new building materials. Research challenges include the development of efficient extraction of Fe, Al, Ti and rare earths (incl. Sc) from distinct (NORM classified) BRs and the preparation of new building materials with higher than usual Fe content. By training the researchers in pyro-, hydro- and ionometallurgy, electrolysis, rare-earth extraction and separation technology, inorganic polymer and cement chemistry, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), NORM aspects and characterisation, they become the much needed scientists and engineers for the growing European critical raw materials industry.",2014-12-01,2019-10-31,3720893.4,,"['low-carbon building', 'recycling']",2,2
1087,646747,N2FEED,N2 as Chemical Feedstock â€“ Synthetic Nitrogen Fixation beyond Haber-Bosch,"The chemical transformation of dinitrogen is one of the most important industrial processes. Thereby produced ammonia serves as nitrogen source for almost any synthetic nitrogen containing compound, such as fertilizers or many polymers and pharmaceuticals. However, despite forcing conditions associated with high energy consumption, the Haber-Bosch process gives low yields in NH3. Hence, homogeneous, bioinspired nitrogen fixation is a longstanding goal, yet with very limited success. In this proposal, we strive to circumvent the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of N-containing chemicals by direct N2 functionalization upon initial splitting into molecular nitrides at ambient conditions and subsequent Câ€“N bond formation. Catalytic platforms will be developed based on late, electron rich transition metal complexes with functional pincer ligands, which represents a fundamentally new approach for this purpose. The overall N2 functionalization effort will be broken down into three elementary steps, i.e. N2 splitting, de-/hydrogenation of metal bound N-species, and Câ€“N bond formation. These subprojects are examined individually with a combination of modern synthetic, physical inorganic, and computational methods. These results will finally enable the rational design of homogeneous catalysts. Hence, besides the primary goal to directly use N2 as chemical feedstock this project will also serve the secondary objectives of making important contributions to related timely and challenging topics, such as Câ€“N coupling by nitrenoid transfer or the use of nitrogen compounds, especially ammonia, as chemical fuels in energy storage applications. The previous record of my group in the chemistry of electron-rich transition metal complexes with functional pincer ligands, N2 splitting/coupling, and the activation of other N-containing small-molecules provide a strong basis for the feasibility of these challenging goals.",2015-06-01,2020-05-31,1998500.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2

The ideal screening test is high-accuracy, low-cost, non-invasive, easily repeatable, effortlessly operated by a lay-person and has minimal impact on the personâ€™s daily activities.. In the SNIFFPHONE project, we aim to tackle these requirements by integrating heterogeneous micro- and nano-technologies into autonomous smart system that can be attached to a mobile phone and analyze disease markers from exhaled breath. In this approach, an interaction between breath sample and a miniaturized array of highly sensitive nanomaterial-based chemical sensors is recorded, stored and pre-processed by integrated miniature on-chip microfluidics and electronics, and then the relevant electrical signals are transferred wirelessly via the mobile phoneâ€™s internet to an external server. Statistical pattern recognition methods are then applied on the received data and a clinical report including the screening results is sent back to the designated receiver (e.g., specialist, family doctor) in case of positive result is revealed. SNIFFPHONE represents a new concept addressing major societal challenges in health and well-being of the general population, while taking into account constituent ethical and security aspects. The SNIFFPHONE end-product will integrate functionalities that are relevant to the health screening applications with decreased size (x30-40), decreased costs (x150), increased predictive and cognitive functions and full autonomy with energy management as well as with operation/use management.

1090,828485,THE SOLAR URBAN HUB,A SOLAR URBAN HUB with integrated lighting and information system for optimal Smart Cities efficiency,"Commitment to clean energy nowadays should be essential for governments, companies and citizens. Sustainable urban planning helps improve the welfare of the community, shaping public areas into clean and efficient spaces to live. On the other hand, IoT is changing the way in which cities are operating by enabling effective infrastructure management. The Solar Hub is a new concept of solar urban furniture which converts smart street lighting into an IoT enabling smart city tool. Conventional street lighting is associated with high energy and maintenance requirements, resulting in high costs for municipalities. Although energy efficient lighting solutions are gaining ground, they often fall short of addressing the sustainable development of Smart Cities: lack of aesthetic appeal, no-use of solar energy, difficult integration of sensors and smart devices and not designed for a long term retrofitting. SIARQ addresses all these challenges in a single solution, championing a new concept of solar urban furniture. The Solar Hub belongs to the new generation of Cradle to Cradle zero CO2 emissions products entirely powered by the Sun. It stands out by its dome-shaped lightweight photovoltaic module that houses environmental sensors and other smart devices that enable different kinds of monitoring. SIARQ thus actively contributes to overcoming the lack of interoperable solutions and the risk of fragmentation that have been acknowledged by the European Commission as major challenges to the deployment and exploitation of the IoT potential. SIARQâ€™s business model targets Telecoms, IT service providers and Energy Service Companies as preferential channels to reach the end users and to generate new business models with shared incomes.

1092,840038,SOLFORPLAS,A solution for plastic waste pollution,"Since the 1970s, the mismanagement of plastic waste has been increasingly threatening our health and environment. Rather than been reduced, plastic production is growing exponentially. By 2050, the estimation of plastic waste in landfills or in the natural environment verges on 12 billion metric tons, if current production and waste management trends continue. Societies are raising awareness about this concern, although our dependency makes nearly impossible to imagine a world without plastics. This urges for a solution making plastic production and degradation sustainable. To date, important efforts have been made to isolate and identify unique microorganisms capable of utilizing plastics as a carbon source. Although there is empirical evidence of it, the rates of biodegradation are still very low. In SOLFORPLAS project, we will apply cutting-edge biology tools, including fermentation and analytical processes, together with state-of-the-art methods in industrial microbiology research, to investigate plastic biodegradation using a highly-optimized strategy that combines an extruder and a bioreactor. The innovative combined strategy will integrate physical, chemical and biological treatment, which will mimic the whole biodegradation process taking place in worms. Multiple polymer characteristics will be monitored to determine/quantify its biodegradation. Overall, SOLFORPLAS project aim at stablishing a combined strategy to carry out plastic biodegradation as a solution for plastic pollution, one of the biggest environmental that humans are facing in this century.",2019-09-02,2021-09-01,184707.84,['Waste management'],['waste management'],2,2
1093,832480,DEEPCAT,Degradable Polyolefin Materials Enabled by Catalytic Methods,"Plastics are essential to virtually any modern technology and therefore ubiquitious. However, when released to the environment they can persist for centuries. One pillar of a responsible future economy is therefore to endow important plastics with a non-persistent nature. Polyethylene (PE) is the largest scale synthetic material, used in transportation, energy storage, water cleaning, clothing and many other fields. However, it is most problematic concerning degradability.  This proposal addresses this major challenge by introducing photo- and hydrolytically degradable groups in the PE chain. Directly during catalytic PE synthesis, isolated keto groups will be generated by incorporation of small amounts of carbon monoxide. This yet unachieved goal is targeted via catalysts with extreme shielding and rigid ligand environments in heterobimetallic Ni(II) / main group metal complexes. A compartmentalized aqueous polymerization with precise control of high ethylene/CO ratios will yield the in-chain functionalized PE as nano- and microscale particle dispersions. Living catalytic polymerization in nanoparticles is pursued to achieve ultra high molecular weights and gradient PE chains forming nanodomains varying in ketone density. Aqueous heterophase oxidation with benign oxidants on all these nanoparticle will yield in-chain ester groups. Further types of hydrolytically cleavable groups are targeted via the complementary synthetic approach of step growth from seed- or microalgae-oil derived PE-telechelics. This yields linear PE with in-chain carbonate, acetal and anhydride groups. Basic materials properties of all polymers are determined by tensile tests. Degradation studies reflecting a marine environment will indicate the persistency behaviour and fate of microfragments, using macroscopic specimens and the above particles as models.

In 3D-PRESS, glass-based compositions will be designed and synthesized in order to obtain printable glass-based electrolytes with superior conductivity and functional properties. The produced glasses will be thermally and electrochemically characterized in order to investigate their sinter-crystallization behaviour (tailoring suitable sintering treatments) and electrochemical performances. The most promising electrolyte compositions will be selected to be printed in free-form robust self-standing structures in order to obtain 3D batteries with high active area (allowing high specific energy and power per unit volume).

3D-PRESS represents a cutting edge multidisciplinary approach for the development of reliable and customizable all-solid state 3D LIBs, especially interesting for micro-power applications such as the ones for Internet of Things (IoT). The project will provide a new family of printable materials increasing the short list of available compositions, especially solid electrolytes, opening the door to the development of a new generation of fully printable all-solid state 3D LIBs.

Both networks are looking at integrated solutions targeting: i) reduction of electricity losses ii) increase the grid stability in a high local RES penetration scenario iii) accommodate the needs of new energy actors such as EVs, electrical storages and prosumers. Electrified transport networks such as light railways could act to enhance distribution grid stability providing ancillary services inter-exchanging electricity.

1101,768559,DRIMPAC,Unified DR interoperability framework enabling market participation of active energy consumers,"Buildings constitute a vast, yet currently untapped, source of energy demand flexibility that can provide invaluable services to the energy system. This flexibility currently remains unattainable due to the lack of a technological framework that can connect the multitude of buildings and building systems with the energy system in a cost-effective manner as well as the reluctance of energy consumers to enroll in demand response programs.
DRIMPAC offers a comprehensive solution to empower consumer to become active participants in the energy markets. It comprises three main pillars:
a) A legacy and Standards-compliant interoperability framework to interconnect building energy loads/appliances and expose their demand flexibility as price-responsive demand to the grid or for market actors to aggregate and bid in ancillary service markets.
b) A human-centric, intelligent building energy management system that will lift the burden of demand response from the consumers shoulders and reduce reluctance and fear of participation in DR programs. It will infer user comfort preferences and dynamically control building loads to minimize energy cost and use for the building occupant leveraging dynamic prices, while always preserving comfortable and healthy indoor conditions.
c) Innovative business models and service offering for energy retailers in order to facilitate their transformation from commodity suppliers to digital energy service suppliers and kick-start the deployment of the DRIMPAC solution in the market.
The DRIMPAC technological framework and business models will be validated by four retailers supplying three energy carriers â€“ electricity, natural gas and district heating â€“ in four different national markets across the EU - France, Cyprus, Germany and Spain. Pilot demonstrations will take place in a range of building types, including residential, office, educational and others, in order to validate the DRIMPAC benefits across most building typologies.",2018-09-01,2021-08-31,3770583.38,['Energy management'],['district heating'],2,2

These will be major drivers in the construction sector in the next few years, because all new buildings in the EU from 2021 onwards are expected to be nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB).
While realized NZEB have clearly shown that nearly-zero energy target could be achieved using existing technologies and practices, most experts agree that a broad scale shift towards nearly-zero energy buildings require significant adjustments to prevailing building market structures. Cost-effective integration of efficient solution sets and renewable energy systems, in a form that fits with the development, manufacturing and construction industry processes, as well as with planning, design, and procurement procedures, are the major challenges.

1106,637367,HyMoCo,Hybrid Node Modes for Highly Efficient Light Concentrators,"The meaning of solar energy for future decentralized power supply will largely depend on both efficiency and cost of solar to electrical power conversion. All kinds of conversion strategies including photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar to fuel and others would benefit from efficiently collecting solar power on large areas. For this reason luminescent solar concentrators have been developed for over thirty years, but due to waveguide losses their maximum size is still limited to a few centimeters.

The proposed project suggests the exploitation of a new type of electromagnetic waveguide in order to realize passive planar concentrators of unsurpassed collection efficiency, size, concentration, lifetime and costs.
 
A dielectric TE1-mode shows a node, a position in the waveguide where no intensity is found. A thin film placed in this node remains largely â€œinvisibleâ€ for the propagating mode. Such dielectric node modes (DNMs) have been investigated by the applicant in previous work, but only recently a silver island film (SIF) was for the first time placed in such a node. The resulting extremely low waveguide losses cannot be explained by our current understanding of waveguide modes and hint to a hybridization between the SIF-bound long-range surface plasmon polaritons (LRSPPs) and the DNMs into what we call hybrid node modes (HNMs).
 
The SIFs strongly interact with incident light. An appropriate nanopatterning of SIFs enables efficient excitation of low-loss HNMs modes collecting solar power over square meters and concentrating it. To achieve this goal new technological methods are used that enable patterning on the nanometer scale and low cost roll-to-roll processing at the same time. New measurement techniques and numerical simulation tools will be developed to investigate the HNMs â€“ a novel kind of electromagnetic modes â€“ and their exploitation in the passive solar concentrators.",2015-03-01,2020-02-29,1485000.0,['Fuel'],['concentrated solar power'],2,2

Despite the meteoric rise of the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (up to 20% in less than 5 years) they is still a substantial potential of improvement towards the theoretical efficiency limits. During the first research phase, most of the effort has been devoted to the development of deposition processes to produce the best crystalline thin films. APPEL has the ambition to initiate the second phase, in which fundamental understanding of the recombination losses in the perovskite and at heterojunctions with charge extraction layers will make possible to generate devices with efficiencies approaching the full potential of these semiconductors. A perfect solar cell should also be an excellent emitter, since 100% of the absorbed photons must recombine radiatively. Therefore the original approach APPEL is to target primarily light emission (photoluminescence and electroluminescence) to understand the factors governing the recombination losses in solar cells. From the understanding of the fundamental recombination mechanisms at the heterojunctions, I will demonstrate highly efficient devices with >23% power conversion efficiency. Moreover, efficient light-emitting diodes (LED) will be produce alongside photovoltaic devices. This work will set the foundation of the future rational optimisation of metal halide perovskite devices in the same way that optimisation of light emission in GaAs led to the advent of devices approaching the theoretical limits.",2016-11-01,2018-10-31,195454.8,,"['solar cell', 'photovoltaic']",2,2

To improve their commercialization capacity, to compete with established power generation and to complement other renewable energy technologies, the performance of state-of-the-art OSCs needs to be further improved.

Our goals within SEPOMO â€“ Spins in Efficient Photovoltaic devices based on Organic Molecules â€“ are to bring the performance of OSCs forward by taking advantage of the so far unexplored degree of freedom of photogenerated species in organic materials, their spin. This challenging idea provides a unified platform for the excellent research to promote the world-wide position of Europe in the field of organic photovoltaics and electronics, and to train strongly motivated early stage researchers (ESRs) for a career in science and technology oriented industry that is rapidly growing. 

Our scientific objectives are to develop several novel routes to enhance the efficiency of OSC by understanding and exploiting the electronic spin interactions. This will allow us to address crucial bottlenecks in state-of-the-art OSCs: we will increase the quantum efficiency by reducing the dominant recombination losses and by enhancing the light harvesting and exciton generation, e.g. by means of internal upconversion of excited states. 

Our ESRs will be trained within this interdisciplinary (physics, chemistry, engineering) and intersectoral (academia, R&D center, enterprise) consortium in highly relevant fundamental yet application-oriented research with the potential to commercialise the results.

Greenhouse-based horticulture could highly contribute to this goal, thanks to its unparalleled benefits in terms of reduced use of water and higher quality and quantity of product with respect to traditional agriculture. Nonetheless, greenhouse facilities need both huge amount of electricity and gas to be operated, accounting for energy consumption of about 3.4 MTOE per year only in Europe, which pushed European policy-makers to promote renewable-based energy solutions for the horticulture sector among the priorities.

PHAs is potential substitute for conventional polymers, since they possess similar properties; respect to polylactic acid (the most widespread biobased/biodegradable material), PHAs show higher biodegradability and better functional properties and mechanical strength. 
However, applications of PHAs as food packaging materials are subjected to some limitations. PHA shows medium values of O2 and H2O transmittance while many the most critical factors for some foods (such dry products as bakeries) in relation to packaging are moisture uptake leading to loss of crispiness and oxidation of fats. 
For overcoming this limiting factor in PHA food applications, BioBarr aims to enhance PHA vapour and gas barrier properties through material functionalization.
In the first research line, the approach consists of the use of biodegradable materials with adequate properties to be compounded in multi-layer structures specific for the food product category to be packed, in order to optimize functional properties. The innovation consists of laminating PHA with PLA (polylactic acid).
The second challenging research line in BioBarr is surface treatments (nanoform metallization with AlOx or SiOx or metallization Aluminum process) of PHA films.
New materials will be validated on a restricted number of food products in the sector of bakery, representative of different shelf-life requirements and duration, with the purpose to increase shelf-life at least by 10%.

However, by understanding the connection between sensing performance and material properties we can enable tailor-made materials. Unfortunately, even with the rigorously studied GC, this is not known.

The ultimate goal is to combine several components in an individual multifunctional platform, realizing on-chip technology. Devices have to be constrained to small footprints and exhibit high performance. Thus, the miniaturization process requires the introduction of new manufacturing processes to fabricate devices in the 3D space over small areas. 3D printing via robocasting is emerging as a new manufacturing technique, which allows shaping virtually any materials from polymers to ceramic and metals into complex architectures.

The main aim is to reuse and/or trade excess thermal energy in a holistic perspective within an industrial process HC/energy system environment or framed in an HC network in regulated or liberalized markets. The resource and energy intensive industries (REII) and DHC networks will be able to use and rely on the EMB3Rs platform to investigate the revenue potential of using industrial excess HC as an energy (re)source. The REII will be able to evaluate the benefits of investing in low carbon options, such as the integration of renewable HC technologies and thermal storage, in industrial processes. 
Ultimately, by translating industrial excess HC into savings, revenues and increased overall system efficiency, EMB3Rs will allow the REII community to improve its competitiveness, foster and accelerate the decarbonisation of the HC market overall and contribute to the EU climate change mitigation goals. Namely by i) contributing to overcome the barriers for developing and deploying in HC solutions, i.e. reaching a critical mass of users, iii) identifying critical framework conditions and success factors and iv) promoting transfer and replication of solutions in other industrial sectors and iv) stimulating the convergence between energy, energy efficiency goals, CO2 reduction and business interests.",2019-09-02,2022-09-01,3984671.32,['Storage'],['thermal storage'],2,2

ENVE is the Committee of the Regionsâ€™ Commission where more than 120 EU local and regional leaders are working for environment, climate change, energy and space policies.

The main organizer of the Conference is the Romanian Municipalities Association (AMR), being the first time in the SET-Plan history, when an association of local authorities will organize this conference. The organisation of the conference will be performed in close cooperation with the European Commission DG Energy, DG Research and Innovation and DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, European Committee of the Regions, Ministry of Energy of Romania and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Romania; the Global Covenant of Mayors; the Permanent Representation of Romania to the EU and Cityhall of the District 3 of Bucharest.

The main objective of the 12th year anniversary SET Plan conference is to perform an exchange of numerous innovative ideas and good practices with a clear involvement of local and regional leaders from the European Union in areas as: Integrated energy systems; Energy poverty and management of the energy transition in vulnerable regions; Improving performance and reducing cost of renewable energy; Energy Efficiency in Buildings; Energy Efficiency in Industry; Smart Cities; e-Mobility; Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage; Digitalization and ICT in energy; Blue energy. Since this exchange should be inclusive, pragmatic and forward looking, we intend to involve a large number of EU, national, local and regional public and private stakeholders, academia, as well as a consistent number of political leaders.",2019-06-01,2019-12-31,249750.0,['Storage'],['renewable energy'],2,2
1120,747449,NExtNCNaBatt,Novel Extended solids based on N=C chemistry for future Na-ion Batteries,"The large and increasing demand for energies with a low CO2 footprint has prompted intense research and development on renewable energies as well as on sustainable electrochemical energy storage systems to fully utilize them. This requires the development and understanding of battery chemistries from earth abundant low cost raw materials, which can be easily synthesized, with Na-ion batteries (NIBs) at the forefront of meeting these requirements. 
While in Na-ion batteries most efforts are made to investigate materials that are essentially derivatives of Li chemistry, there are opportunities to look at very different chemistries which were not explored for Li ion batteries or just work much better in Na batteries. The goal of this NExtNCNaBatt project is the investigation of designed novel materials based on the N=C derived anions and their application as electrodes for sodium ion batteries. The major objective is the establishment of a fundamental understanding of the Na to N=C interactions in Novel Extended solids based on the NC chemistry for Na-ion batteries which will be achieved through the study of structural changes in the bulk by in-situ x-ray diffraction studies, as well as local changes in the atomic environment followed by advanced spectroscopic studies.
Na-ion batteries are just at the birth of commercialization, and therefore materials developed in this project could be timely incorporated into next generation prototypes and first commercial Na-ion batteries. Additionally, these new materials and the understanding of the alkali to NC interactions will be relevant to many other areas of research where electrochemical transformations occur, such as other battery chemistries, capacitors, electrochromic displays, and as photocatalysts, all systems where the understanding of the heterogeneous reactions between the solid electrode and ions from a liquid electrolyte are of critical importance.",2017-03-01,2019-07-16,195454.8,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
1121,824348,ENDURUNS,Development and demonstration of a long-endurance sea surveying autonomous unmanned vehicle with gliding capability powered by hydrogen fuel cell,"Battery-powered AUVs have been used to study the seabed without the requirement of a human operator. Their operational endurance is limited by the available battery charge. Gliders, an AUV subclass, use small changes in their buoyancy to move like a profiling float. By using their wings, gliders can convert the vertical motion to horizontal, propelling themselves forward with very low power consumption. Hence, mission duration can be extended to months and to thousands of kilometers. However, gliders are suited for a particular set of missions involving relatively basic measurements and seabed mapping cannot be performed due to their inherent inability to cruise in a straight line.  A surface support vessel is standard practice for launch and recovery of AUVs. The requirement to have a support vessel adds to the overall mission cost. Therefore higher endurance is needed in AUV platforms in order to bring mission costs down and improve the ocean exploration capability. The ENDURUNS project will deliver a step-change in AUV technology by implementing a novel hybrid design power by hydrogen fuel cell. An Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) will support the operation of the AUV, providing geotagging and data transmission capability to and from the Control Centre on shore.",2018-11-01,2022-10-31,7908265.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,2
1122,823124,HTCycle,Sewage sludge reuse with Phosphate recovery and heavy metal absorption with an innovative HTC technology.,"Efficient municipal waste-water treatment, such as the systems currently in place in most European municipalities, produces vast amounts of sewage sludge. The latest data collected show a yearly production of 9.637 thousands of tons in the EU28 countries. Sludge treatment issues are often neglected in comparison with water-related parameters which results in serious technical difficulties and highly expensive disposal methods. As a result, an energy efficient, environmentally sound and economically viable process for sludge disposal and reuse of valuable resources e.g. phosphorus hardly exists.
The most common disposal methods for sludge are spreading on agricultural soil, composting and incineration. Land-filling has been long banned, the use as fertilizer, although very moderate in costs, is being banned in many regions due to concerns about contamination of soils with heavy metals and endocrine disruptive compounds. Composting raises the same concerns, and it is a labour-intensive and unsafe process, which leaves incineration as the most used option, albeit an expensive and not effective one. Incineration entails the highest costs (80-110 â‚¬ /ton), but is also considered the safest disposal method and is fast growing and widely adopted. It presents also technical difficulties, such as the low overall efficiency of the process, the huge logistic efforts required to transport the sludge to the incineration plants, or the disposal of the ashes after the sludge has been incinerated.
In this situation, our company, AVA has the objective to demonstrate and commercialize our proprietary technology for hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of sewage sludge, showing clearly technical and economic ad-vantages against the current sludge incineration method. We aim to increase the amount of sludge converted into high value products such as fuel, activated carbons for water treatment, recovered phosphorus, soil remediation material, carbon sequestration schemes and other applications. The HTCycle process turns the present sewage sludge disposal (incineration) from a costly process into an income-generating activity.",2018-09-01,2020-08-31,1373400.0,['Fuel'],['carbon sequestration'],2,2
1123,768739,CATALYST,Converting DCs in Energy Flexibility Ecosystems (CATALYST),"Data Centres (DC) are among the largest yet increasing energy consumers, due to the rising digitization of human activities. RES integration and energy efficiency improvements have the potential to reduce significantly DC carbon footprint, while increasing at the same time the auto-consumed energy, thus improving DC security and resiliency of supply against climate change. However, very few solutions, despite validated in lab, have been successfully deployed on operational DCs, mostly due to technological fragmentation, excessive CAPEX and lack of appropriate business models. CATALYST will address these challenges through turning existing/new DCs into flexible multi-energy hubs, which can sustain investments in RES and energy efficiency by offering mutualized flexibility services to the smart energy grids (both electricity and heat grids). By leveraging on the outcomes of FP7 GEYSER and DOLPHIN projects, CATALYST will adapt, scale up, validate and deploy an innovative, adaptable technological and business framework aimed at i) exploiting available DC non-IT legacy assets (onsite RES/backup generation, UPS/batteries, cooling system thermal inertia, heat pump for waste heat reuse) to deliver simultaneous energy flexibility services to multi-energy coupled electricity/heat/IT load marketplaces ii) deploying Cross-DC cross-infrastructures (e.g. heat vs IT) IT workload orchestration, by combining heat-demand driven HPC geographical workload balancing, with traceable ICT-load migration between federated DCs to match IT demands with time-varying on-site RES (â€œfollow the energy approachâ€) iii) providing marketplace-as-a-service tools to nurture novel ESCO2.0 business models. The adaptation and replication potential of CATALYST will be demonstrated through carrying out four different real life trials spanning through the full spectrum of DCs types (fully distributed DCs, HPC, co-location, legacy) and architectures (from large centralized versus decentralized micro-DCs).",2017-10-01,2020-09-30,2299103.5,,"['waste heat reuse', 'heat pump']",2,2

The materials will be developed using sustainable, non-toxic and non-critical raw materials.  They will be scaled-up, integrated into a gas phase electrochemical reactor, and the process validated for technical and economic feasibility under industrially relevant conditions. The produced methanol can be used as a chemical feedstock or for effective chemical storage of renewable energy.  The demonstration of the new materials at TRL5 level, and the potential of this technology for market penetration, will be assessed by achieving a target electrochemical performance > 50 A/g at 1.5  V/cell, a CO2 conversion rate > 60%,  and a selectivity > 90% towards methanol production with an enthalpy efficiency for the process > 86%. A significant increase in durability under intermittent operation in combination with renewable power sources is also targeted in the project through several stabilization strategies to achieve a degradation rate of < 1%/1000 h at stack level. The developed low-temperature CO2 conversion reactor will offer fast response (frequency > 2-5 Hz) to electrical current fluctuations typical of intermittent power sources and a wide operating range in terms of input power, i.e. from 10% to full power in less than a second. Such aspects are indicative of an excellent dynamic behaviour as necessary to operate with renewable power sources. A life cycle assessment of the CO2 electrolysis system, which will compile information at different levels from materials up to the CO2 electrolysis system including processing resources, will complete the assessment of this technology for large-scale application.

1125,727606,HYMEFCECS,Hydrogen production by membrane free chemical â€“ electrochemical systems,"Until recently it was believed to be impossible to produce hydrogen through water electrolysis systems, without an electrochemical oxygen production process and without a membrane. However, in the past few years, our team was able to develop a new technological configuration which divides the water splitting process into two phases : (1) an efficient electrochemical hydrogen production followed by a (2) spontaneous chemical oxygen production phase. By eliminating the inefficient electrochemical water oxidation reaction (OER) we achieve a significant increase in hydrogen production efficiency. Furthermore, reducing the danger of mixing hydrogen and oxygen eliminates the need for a membrane. A membrane-free system enables high pressure hydrogen production without the risk of gas mixture or membrane failure. Moreover, as the membrane failure is the main cause for malfunctions and offline times of alkaline and PEM electrolyzer, our technology improves system reliability and energy efficiency.

The purpose of this PoC is to further develop our basic lab prototype to demonstrate two  potential commercial applications:(1)Power to Gas (P2G) storage of renewable energy (demonstrating the ability to produce hydrogen with high efficiency and under high peaks) and (2) On-site hydrogen production for hydrogen refuelling stations (demonstrating purity and durability under high-pressure). Furthermore, HYMEFCECS, will include an in-depth user requirements analysis (combining business, economic and technical inputs); devising a proper business model and business plan per two target markets, financial forecasting, Intellectual Property and an Investor Toolkit.",2017-06-01,2018-11-30,150000.0,['Storage'],['renewable energy'],2,2
1126,749207,DualFun,Dual Function Polymer Materials for Blood Contacting Applications,"Surface-induced thrombosis and infection are two main complications which cause failure of medical devices. Device-related thrombosis is associated with activation of blood clotting and platelets adhesion and activation. Infection of the implanted devices occurred as a result of bacteria adhesion to the biomaterial surface. A genuinely biocompatible polymer for blood-contacting devices should have both antithrombotic and antibacterial functionalities as both types of complication lead to an increase in morbidity, extended hospital stay and mortality.
In order to prevent device-induced thrombosis and infection novel dual function polymer materials - thromboresistant and antimicrobial, will be produced. A novel and original approach that involves construction of multifunctional coatings, which combine formulation of the NO-generating surface with the ability to prevent bacterial adhesion, capacity to inhibit platelet adhesion and the use of surface bound argatroban drug to inhibit any surface-produced thrombin, will be applied. The polymer matrices chosen for the design of dual function materials are the most commonly used synthetic polymers polyurethane (PU) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) and the biopolymer collagen. This aim will be achieved by: i) chemical attachment of the organoselenium or copper nanoparticle catalysts to the polymer surface in order to continuously generate NO by decomposition of endogenous S-nitrosothiols; ii) immobilisation of the direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban to inhibit any thrombin in the surrounding environment. Catecholamines, polydopamine and poly(norepinephrine) will be used as the surface modification reagents, as they form very stable thin films strongly attached to the polymer surface. Owing to the chemical bonding of the ligand to the polymer surface it is expected that these materials will have long storage life and exploitation period and therefore retain their ability to generate NO from the inexhaustible endogenous NO donors.",2017-09-18,2019-09-17,195454.8,['Storage'],['biopolymer'],2,2
1127,743900,GREEN FORESEEN,Proposal title GREEce: modeliNg of the FOREst SEctor EcoNomy,"The economic role of the forest sector in Greece is a neglected field of academic inquiry. Studies of the markets for Greek
forest products, are few and far between. This reflects a general lack of investment in the forest sector of the country. An
example of this is that the last national forest census was carried out in 1992. Meanwhile, the economic crisis that has
plagued the country since 2008 has made matters worse, not only in terms of funds to study the sector but also in terms of
environmental outcomes. For instance, as a result of increasing poverty levels, many people have resorted to the use of
fuelwood to satisfy their energy needs. This may seem like a good thing, in light of the Renewables Directive's targets for
renewable energy adoption. In reality, the switch to fuelwood has led to a severe increase in illegal logging. Despite the
numerous and frequent media reports, scientific evidence of this is lacking.
The GREEN FORESEEN project has two main objectives: to study the consumption of fuelwood by households in Greece
and, by doing so, to lay down the foundations for the development of the first Greek Forest Sector Model (GFSM), which will
be a partial-equilibrium model of the forest sector. The first goal will be achieved by way of designing and carrying out a
survey of the fuelwood market in Greece, as well as by analysing national statistics on energy consumption. This will give
insights on all aspects of fuelwood demand and supply and will allow for the characterisation of the illegal logging problem. It
will also assist in the development of the GFSM, as fuelwood constitutes over 65% of total timber production in the country.
The ultimate goal of the GFSM will be to enhance forest management by simulating impacts of policy and market changes
on the sector. An intentional byproduct of the GFSM will be the generation of knowledge that can be utilised by other
models, such as the EC's European Forest Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN).",2018-09-01,2021-08-20,150932.1,,"['forest management', 'renewable energy']",2,2
1128,714870,MMUSCLES,Modification of Molecular structure Under Strong Coupling to confined Light modES,"Understanding and controlling the properties of matter is one of the overarching goals of modern science. A powerful way to achieve is this by using light, usually in the form of intense laser beams. However, modern advances in nanophotonics allow us to confine light modes so strongly that their effect on matter is felt even when no external fields are present. In this regime of â€œstrong couplingâ€ or â€œvacuum Rabi splittingâ€, the fundamental excitations of the coupled system are hybrid light-matter states which combine the properties of both constituents, so-called polaritons. Little attention has been paid to the fact that strong coupling can also affect internal structure, such as nuclear motion in molecules. First experimental indications for this effect have been found, but current theory cannot explain or predict such changes. We will thus develop theoretical methods that can treat the modification of molecular structure under strong coupling to confined light modes. This will require advances in the microscopic description of the molecules under strong coupling by explicitly including their rovibrational degrees of freedom, as well as techniques to incorporate the influence of these modes in the macroscopic setting of collective strong coupling. In order to achieve this, we will adapt well-known techniques from quantum chemistry and combine them with the concepts of polariton physics. We will investigate what level of control can be gained through this approach, and whether confined light modes could act as a â€œphotonic catalystâ€ to control molecular dynamics without requiring an active ingredient. This could present a novel tool to control photochemical reactions that are of paramount importance in the biological mechanisms of vision and photosynthesis, and hold great interest for use in memories, photoswitching devices, light-driven actuators, or solar energy storage.

The fields have witnessed huge attention world-wide in recent years. In spite of advancement of the 2D materials, there is a lack of proper chemical functionalization. Therefore, apposite functionalization of TMDCs to tune electronic charge and spin properties beyond current systems is extremely crucial. Herein, we propose chemical functionalization of 2D-TMDCs by optical and electroactive functional terpyridyl (tpy) complexes. The functional terpyridyl complexes offer numerous advantages including (i) much more robustness due to strong metal-to-ligand back bonding through [dÏ€(M)-pÏ€(L)] as compared to the organic ligands, (ii) versatile coordination modes, (iii) tunable, and reversible redox properties, and (iv) switchable metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band in the visible region. Through this functionalization we will be able to: 
I-Modify 2D materials properties at different level depending on: (i) The strength of the new interaction between complex and 2D crystal, from soft modification by electrostatic interaction to strong modification by covalent one; and (ii) the degree of functionalization, from low coverage of the 2D crystal to highly packed coverage giving rise to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) formation.

Two different strategies will be followed and demonstrated at three different end users facilities to achieve CO2 separation:
- A combination of Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMM) for pre- and post-combustion, 
- A combination of metallic membranes and sorbents into an advanced Membrane Assisted Sorption Enhanced Reforming (MA-SER) process for pure H2 production with integrated CO2 capture

To achieve this objective, MEMBER has been built on the basis of the best materials and technologies developed in three former FP7 projects, ASCENT, M4CO2 and FluidCELL. In particular, special attention will be paid to the manufacturing processes scale up of key materials and products such as Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), polymers, membranes and sorbents.

TeacHy 2020 will take a lead in building a repository of university grade educational material, and design and run an MSc course in FCHT, accessible to students from all parts of Europe. To achieve this, the project has assembled a core group of highly experienced institutions working with a network of associate partners (universities, vocational training bodies, industry, and networks). TeacHy2020 offers these partners access to its educational material and the use of the MSc course modules available on the TeacHy2020 site.

1133,760884,CARMOF,CARMOF: New process for efficient CO2 capture by innovative adsorbents based on modified carbon nanotubes and MOF materials,"CO2 capture process represents typically about 70% of the total cost of the CCS chain. Power plants that capture CO2 today use an old technology whereby flue gases are bubbled through organic amines in water, where the CO2 binds to amines. The liquid is then heated to 120-150ÂºC to release the gas, after which the liquids are reused. The entire process is expensive and inefficient: it consumes about 30 percent of the power generated.
One of the most promising technologies for CO2 capture is based on the adsorption process using solid sorbents, with the most important advantage being the potential energy penalty reduction for regeneration of the material compared to liquid absorption . Nevertheless, the challenge in this application remains the same, namely to intensify the production of a CO2 stream in terms of adsorption/desorption rates and energy use while preserving the textural characteristics of the sorbents. The key objectives of the CARMOF project are (1) to build a full demonstrator of a new energy and cost-competitive dry separation process for post-combustion CO2 capture based on hybrid porous Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) & Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) (2) to design customized, high packed density & low pressure drop structures based on 3D printing technologies containing hybrid MOF/CNT to be used in CO2 capture system based on fluidized beds. The morphology of the printed absorber will be designed for the specific gas composition of each of the selected industries (ceramic, petrol products and steel) and (3) to optimize the CO2 desorption process by means of Joule effect combined with a vacuum temperature swing adsorption (VTSA)/membrane technology that will surpass the efficiency of the conventional heating procedures",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,5993227.63,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,2

Despite the great efforts though, only a limited number of colloidal NC compounds has been successfully employed, which either rely on costly and scarce elements or toxic materials. HEINSOLÂ´s mission is to develop the first highly efficient, robust solution processed solar cell platform based on environmentally friendly, Earth abundant materials. To achieve this, HEINSOL undertakes a hierarchical approach to tailor the opto-electronic properties of inorganic NCs, starting from the control of composition and their properties at the atomic level and following up with further tailoring their optoelectronic properties via interactions at the supra-nanocrystalline level. HEINSOL, at the atomic level, will develop novel doping schemes for colloidal NCs to tailor their electronic character as well as passivation schemes to reduce the density of unfavourable trap states. At the supra-nanocrystalline level, HEINSOL will explore novel nano-heterojunctions that cater for efficient charge separation and suppressed recombination, elements of paramount importance in high performance solar cells. The microscopic properties of the NCs will be correlated with the macroscopic properties of the NC composites in operating devices, a methodology that will provide new insights on the underlying mechanisms at the nanoscale that govern the properties of those devices.

Rather than focussing on specific chemical or physical processes, as has been done in the past, COMPLEX will consider polymeric objects as almost akin to living organisms, and by using a system dynamics approach will model objects in their environments in a way that reflects their real complexity, with multiple, inter-connecting interactions between material properties and environmental parameters.
As a polymer chemist, this project has been inspired by my 4 years of experience in the field of heritage, in particular by experiencing the problems raised by the conservation of modern polymeric objects such as plastics.  The development of modern polymers during the 19th and 20th centuries has changed history and society and they are a part of our material heritage that it is essential to conserve for future generations.  However, these objects are at risk due to their instability and a lack of knowledge within the museum sector as to their degradation behaviour.
System dynamics models will be developed incorporating multiple chemical and physical interactions between the components of polymeric objects and environmental parameters such as relative humidity or light.

HTEPV devices can convert the solar energy more efficiently than normal solar cells, since the thermoelectric component recovers part of the unused heat generated within them. In this project the hybrid optimization will be obtained with an innovative approach recently proposed within a theoretical/computational study by the fellow, Dr. Bruno Lorenzi. The principal objective of this action will be the practical hybridization of two kinds of single junction solar cells in HTEPV devices achieving performances higher than the PV cell alone by at least 25%. The project will be organized in three main phases: outgoing phase (first HTEPV development), ingoing phase (second HTEPV development), and a secondment (encapsulation development at a non-academic institution). Dr. Lorenzi will acquire knowledge and know-how especially by training through research in achieving the objectives of the action. This will contribute to make Dr. Lorenzi an independent and expert researcher in the perspective of his future research carrier. The project will also surely contribute to the advance of field of the energy harvesting. Actually it is well known that for renewables, the higher the efficiency the lower is the total-cost/produced-power ratio. Thus the large expected increase of efficiency for the hybrid devices developed in this action will have a major impact on their price per watt. This will open new concrete possibilities for near-future commercialization of this novel generation of solar harvesters, stimulating industrial productions and new markets. This in turn will lead to a wider diffusion and a higher accessibility of a renewable source of energy for the EU citizens.",2017-09-01,2020-06-30,247924.8,,"['PV', 'photovoltaic']",2,2

After a decade of steady development, the available library of 2D crystals is highly rich including graphene derivatives, hexagonal boron nitride, many chalcogenides and various oxides. However, the technological advances and urgent environmental and sustainable energy issues such as CO2 capture and separation, energy storage and conversion (photovoltatic system, supercapacitor etc) call for advanced materials with not only properties of individual layers but also new functionalities. Particularly, researches on superstructures with unique properties such as amphiphilicity still remain blank. Physically, it is now possible to create such hybrid superstructures by placing different 2D crystals on top of each other in a designed sequence; while engineering the 2D units through a chemical way endows a high flexibility in surface chemistry tailoring and increase the mechanical stability due to the strongly bonded interface. Taking these into consideration, here we propose a combined chemical-physical pathway to engineer task-specific, mechanically freestanding superstructures based on 2D atomic planes in a simple and scalable manner. Three new material concepts are proposed including amphiphilic superstructure (hydrophilic outer layer and hydrophobic inner layer), gas selective superstructure (CO2-phililc outer layer and gas shape selective inner layer) and flexible superstructure with outer layer functionalized with metal oxide nanoparticles confined in ordered mesopores and inner conductive graphene. The obtained superstructures with these structural features will be oriented environmental and sustainable energy issues such as CO2 capture and separation, water purification and flexible electrode.

UC market has shown 30% CAGR since 2009. Leading consultancy IDTechEx estimates that by 2021 the directly addressable segment of large format ultracapacitors (over 100F) is forecast to reach $4bn USD. The same research identifies low energy and power density, together with high costs, as the main factors inhibiting further market growth. Skeleton Technologies (SKL) has developed a patented carbide derived carbon (CDC) UC technology, which enables a four-fold increase in power density (78 kW/L) and twice the energy density (20 Wh/L) and, approximately halving the cost/performance ratio. 
The competitive advantage in performance and system level savings has been verified by SKLÂ´s customers ABB, Bosch, Continental, BMW, Audi.
SKL go-to-market strategy focuses on European customers in the industrial equipment, power grid and transportation industries. The revenue ramp-up plan is based on quantities and pricing information from numerous LOIÂ´s and contracts with the pilot customers and fits the geographical and industry focus of SKLÂ´s strategy. 
With 47 employees, incl. 9 PhDÂ´s as the research core, and robust backing from strategic and private equity investors, SKL has the facilities and investments in place for UC production ramp-up. The aim of this project is to develop the technology necessary for CDC production in industrial scale to provide raw material for UC production and underpin the SKL performance advantage.
The technological challenge is scaling CDC production from TRL 6 by deploying large-scale fluidized bed reactors at a partner manufacturer site to achieve TRL 8.

Multiple studies have highlighted that CCUS technologies are expected to play a critical role in the decarbonisation of the European energy and industrial sectors. However, to date CCUS has not been developed in Europe to the extent needed if the EU is to deliver on its climate goals and support the transition to a low carbon economy. It is important that there is a renewed focus on the development of CCUS projects in Europe. 

In 2016 the European Commission, SET-Plan countries, and industry, outlined a Declaration of Intent for CCUS containing 10 targets for 2020, the combination of which will, if delivered, represent a material step towards commercialisation of CCUS technologies in Europe.
A SET-Plan Temporary Working Group 9 was established to develop an Implementation Plan which set out eight Research & Innovation (R&I) Activities which can help to realise the 2020 CCUS targets. The Implementation Plan was approved by the European Commission in September 2017.  

IMPACTS9 will support delivery of the R&I activities outlined in the Implementation Plan for CCUS through the provision of coordination and support to the key public and private stakeholders that are well placed to progress the SET-Plan Implementation Plan actions in the near term. IMPACTS9 will establish sub-groups to support delivery of the R&I activities and progress CCUS. Each work package is designed to support the work of these sub-groups in delivering the R&I activities.

1142,843594,UnsatPorMix,Impact of structural heterogeneity on solute transport and mixing in unsaturated porous media,"Solute transport in unsaturated porous media plays a crucial role in environmental processes affecting soils, aquifers, and carbon capture and storage operations. Natural porous media are characterized by various degrees of structural heterogeneity in the pore size distribution, spatial arrangements and spatial correlations. The impact of this pore-scale heterogeneity on the spreading of a solute plume, its mixing with other solutes, and the resulting reaction rates, is not well understood for unsaturated flow. Since these processes take place at pore scale, direct pore scale experimental measurements are needed to gain comprehensive understanding of them. The aim of UnsatPorMix is thus to elucidate the impact of structural pore-scale heterogeneity on solute spreading/mixing and reaction rates during unsaturated flow, through the combination of micromodel experiments and numerical model simulations. In the first stage of UnsatPorMix, experiments in micromodels with varying degrees of heterogeneity will provide unprecedented results on the phenomenology of pore-scale mechanisms and their effect on solute spreading and mixing. In the second stage, the experimental measurements of phase distribution and solute concentrations, combined to numerically-computed pore scale velocities, will be used to design and validate a pore-scale model for solute transport in these porous media. This model will allow obtaining a large representative numerical data set, enabling statistical analysis and the derivation of quantitative relations between structural heterogeneity and solute transport/mixing. UnsatPorMix will make a significant contribution to the modelling of, and risk assessment for, the various subsurface phenomena and applications cited above. During UnsatPorMix, the applicant will acquire a set of invaluable experimental skills and modeling expertise which will enable him to become an independent researcher and expert in flow and transport in unsaturated porous media.",2019-09-01,2021-08-31,196707.84,['Storage'],['carbon capture and storage'],2,2

Considering the economic and environmental aspects, the resource recovery from PPI wastes is necessary in order to increase the resource efficiency. In that regard, developing novel biorefinery processes to produce multiple products from PPI wastes is interesting under bio and circular economy. On the other hand, the interest on torrefied biomass is rising over the globe as it can replace the coal. However, the economics of torrefied pellets is not competitive compared to the coal. As the majority of the torrefied pellets production costs are coming from raw materials, sourcing them from low cost resources could be helpful to improve the economic competitiveness of the torrefied pellets over coal. To address the above said two issues, this project will study the feasibility of the torrefaction of pulp and paper industry sludge (PPIS) and integrating it with microbial conversion to produce bioenergy carriers i.e. bio-coal and bio-methane and volatile fatty acids. To achieve this, the expertise of the experienced researcher on biomass torrefaction, process modeling and feasibility analysis will be combined with the expertise of the supervisor on microbial conversion processes and biomass pretreatment. Initially, torrefaction of dewatered PPIS will be carried out in order to establish the biofuel characteristics of torrefied PPIS. Later, anaerobic digestion of torrefaction condensate produced through the torrefaction of PPIS will be studied at varied operating conditions in order to establish the production potential of bio-methane and volatile fatty acids. Finally, the proposed process integration will be simulated to a commercial scale from laboratory experimental results in order to evaluate the techno-economic and environmental feasibility.

In order to utilise this currently poorly exploited biomass for higher value purposes, provision of proper logistics and infrastructure to ensure high quality of side-streams for a prolonged window of time is essential. Also promising technologies currently available at lab level need to be adapted to industrial scale and integrated into a biorefinery approach. The objective of the STREAMLINE project is to solve challenges that prevents more sound exploitation of the aquatic resources. This will be obtained by developing, sorting technologies, storage solutions and decision tools that will secure an efficient, sustainable supply system for by-catches, as well as for solid and liquid side-streams from aquaculture, fisheries and the aquatic processing industries to biorefining operations. This will result in valorisation of these raw materials into marketable products. By addressing side-streams from six different raw materials emerging from typical aquaculture, fisheries and aquatic processing industries in Europe, STREAMLINE will take a whole chain perspective to succeed with high quality production of: i) bioactive peptides for nutraceutical, food and feed applications, ii) protein-based food ingredients, iii) savoury ingredients and mineral supplements for food and feed. STREAMLINE will also construct biorefining approaches and validate selected solutions in pilot scale at the premises of participating companies.

1146,743419,SpinSolar,Characterisation method for spin-dependent processes in solar energy technology,"In the search for renewable energy sources, solar energy shows great promise through its conversion to electricity and storable fuels using artificial photosynthesis. A detailed understanding of the energy conversion processes on the nanoscale is needed for the rational design and improvement of solar technology. This project is aimed at the development of a methodology for in-depth characterisation of spin-dependent processes in solar energy devices. The method will be based on a novel combination of pulse Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Electrically Detected Magnetic Resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy with arbitrarily shaped pulses. ESR by itself has already proven to be instrumental for advancing the understanding of natural photosynthesis and the increased sensitivity of EDMR allows the extension of this technique to assembled devices.
The combination of both techniques and development of new pulse schemes based on arbitrarily shaped pulses will lead to significant advancements, enabling the simultaneous study of charge separation, charge transport and catalysis and their interdependence in fully assembled solar-to-fuel devices. The research will utilise cutting-edge instrumentation for simultaneous detection of magnetisation and photocurrent at FU Berlin. To fully exploit the advantages of this methodology, a theoretical description for the new experiments will be implemented in the widely used ESR simulation software EasySpin, providing a unified framework for the description of ESR and EDMR.
The work on this project will serve to diversify the researcherâ€™s competences and provide her with a broad skill set combining experimental and theoretical expertise, paving the way for an independent research career. The methodology developed for the characterisation of solar energy devices will provide new insights into artificial photosynthesis that will guide progress in solar technology with important implications for its commercialisation and industrial application.",2017-11-01,2019-10-31,159460.8,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,2

Our understanding of how these extremely thin and flexible objects are processed in flow is however inadequate, and this is hindering progress towards true market applications. When processed in liquid environments to make nanocomposites, conductive coatings and energy storage devices, 2D nanomaterials tend to fold and break owing to strong shear forces produced by the mechanical agitation of the liquid. This can lead to poorly-oriented, crumpled sheets of small lateral size and therefore of low intrinsic value. Orientation is also a major issue, as ultra-flexible materials are difficult to extend and align.  In this project, I will develop nanoscale fluid-structure simulation techniques to capture with unprecedented resolution the unsteady deformation and fracture dynamics of single and multiple sheets in response to the complex hydrodynamic load produced by shearing flows. In addition, I will demonstrate via simulations new strategies to exploit capillary forces to structure 2D nanomaterials into 3D constructs of desired morphology. To guide the simulations and explore a wider parameter space than allowed in computations, I will develop conceptually new experiments on â€œscaled-up 2D nanomaterialsâ€, macroscopic particles having the same dynamics as the nanoscopic ones. The simulations will include continuum treatments and atomistic details, and will be analysed within the theoretical framework of microhydrodynamics and non-linear solid mechanics.

It is designed to measure column averaged CO2 concentrations for path lengths between 500 and 2000 m. A key advantage over other open-path techniques is that no retroreflector or separate active source is required for fence-line monitoring. It therefore fills a key operational gap in CO2 sensing technologies. In addition, through a laser replacement, the instrument can be used to measure also CH4, allowing both main carbon gas species to be quantified, and producing the name of this project, CarbSens. An affordable greenhouse gas (GHG) sensing platform with spatial coverage of 2000 m that fits into a backpack, can be mounted on an aircraft, car, mast or even a drone would have a wide variety of commercially attractive applications. These include efficient monitoring of CO2 leakage from CO2 storage sites or urban traffic, quantification of fugitive CH4 upon hydraulic fracturing (fracking), CH4 leakage from pipelines or biogas tanks, or refining regional GHG budgets for improved climate modeling. A system with the features of the CO2DIAL is not commercially available. We believe that our technology has the potential to create a new market for affordable, man-portable remote gas sensors, and carbon quantification services. In the initial project phase we will define an adequate commercialization strategy, focusing on user groups in the hydrocarbon and carbon sequestration industries. A commercial prototype will then be derived from the CO2DIAL. A focus will be to make the system affordable (<40 kâ‚¬) and even more compact and lightweight (< 10 kg) to arrive at an instrument that is suitable for a large group of users.

Currently, 95% of the world biodiesel is produced from high-grade feedstock such as rapeseed, sunflower oil, and soybean oil (high-grade feedstock). This led to major environmental problems such as serious destruction of vital soil resources, deforestation and large usage of the available arable land. The negative effects of high-grade feedstock use in biodiesel production resulted in their exclusion from REDII - the proposed new EU mandate that caps high-grade feedstock biodiesel blending at 3.8% by 2030. In order to meet REDIIâ€™s minimum 6.8% blend from alternative feedstocks, the industry needs to produces biofuel such as biodiesel from secondgrade feedstocks, which has technical issues using current production methods. TransBiodiesel Ltd. has patented TransZyme A, an immobilized enzyme technology for the production of biodiesel using any grade feedstocks (FFAs 0â€“ 100%). Its main features are its tolerance to high concentrations of methanol and water and its long-term operational lifetime, which makes its use economically viable for biodiesel production.

1151,815738,eOutboard,High Performance Electric Outboard Motor System and Supply Chain Innovation,"In Europe there are 4.8m boats with outboard engines and 99% percent of them run on petrol or diesel. These conventional boat motors are highly polluting (emitting CO2, methane, carbon monoxide and other substances), burn a massive amount of fossil fuel and are excessively noisy. So why arenâ€™t we electrifying boats like weâ€™re electrifying cars? 
Small and light boats can indeed run on electric engines; however, the current outboard solutions have performance limitations and are very expensive. Larger boats require powerful, higher-performance electric engines (over 80 horsepower) which are cost prohibitive due to the low availability of components and the resulting high production costs associated with them. 
We at pHatching have the solution. We offer a new electric outboard engine design with a customised belt-drive and horizontal drive shaft, allowing us to stack multiple small engines in a modular system. At the same time, we take advantage of the established supply chain and high-volume standard components from the auto industry to dramatically lower the cost of production and maintenance (53% less than current outboard solutions), thereby eliminating the major market barrier to adoption of viable high-performance electric marine engines. We also provide a useful second life for used electric vehicle batteries.
As a result of combining a new design with an innovative use of auto parts, our new electric outboard engine is: (1) green, quiet and powerful (up to 200 hp); (2) easily retrofitted into existing boats; (3) modular and scalable and (4) highly efficient in terms of production and operation.

SynchroGuard provides to utility operators real-time visibility of the grid status, enables safe integration of renewable energy resources, and optimises grid operation for higher efficiency/reliability by quickly reacting or even pre-empting faults.
Competing solutions require both current and voltage sensors at every measurement point to get a complete snapshot of the monitored grid. This is extremely inefficient, as every time a voltage sensor must be installed, a cluster of nearby customers is temporarily disconnected. 
In contrast, SynchroGuard is the first real-time and cost-effective solution that can be retrofitted to existing distribution grids without disruption, and provide fast response on transient grid events. The key innovation is the use of synchrophasor measurements, which are very frequent and time-synchronized measurements of voltage and current signals, taking advantage of voltage sensors already installed at the primary substation, and requiring only additional clamp-on current sensors, which are cheap and non-invasive.

Our consortium formed by San Hitech, with 20 yearsâ€™ involvement in engineering and project management and ThermoSiv, an innovative SME specialized in smart heating solutions to develop AgrowFab, using a highly cost-effective and environmentally-friendly heating fabric comprising nylon fibers coated with a proprietary non-metal carbon compound making them electrically conductive. Heat generated by an electric current flowing through these fibers is directly radiated to the crops as Far Infrared Radiation (FIR), creating a micro-climate around them. Our solution has unlimited design and mechanical flexibility and it also offers the possibility of soil sterilization, decreasing the need of pesticides. Its real-time response to crop needs can increase crop production by up to 35% and decrease energy consumption by at least 40%. AgrowFab can be powered using renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines and combines the aforementioned advantages with an estimated revenue increase of greenhouse businesses by up to 30%.Through this project, we aim to boost the competitiveness of both companies, reaching cumulative revenues of â‚¬55.31 million after 5 years of commercialization, creating 100 new job positions. With a total Phase 2 investment of â‚¬1.6 million, this would imply a ROI of 4.48.",2018-05-01,2018-08-31,50000.0,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,2
1155,661515,SARTEA,SOLAR ADSORPTION REFRIGERATOR WITH THIN-LAYER/ENHAMCED ADSORBENT,"Increased energy costs, the uncertainty of fossil fuel availability, and climate change concerns, have necessitated the quest for renewable energy resources. Solar adsorption systems are quiet, simple to operate, and can last for a long time. However, they have low cooling power density, and subsequently have to be bulky compared to similar solar thermal systems offering the same performance. This can increase their initial costs, especially for small and medium sized systems, thus reducing their uptake. Currently researchers have successfully tackled this issue by, for instance, using more than one adsorbent bed to adopt a continuous cycle, and using forced cooling for the adsorber bed and condenser. These have not resolved the bulk/cost issues, however. This innovative Fellowship will apply a thin layer nano-particles embedded adsorbent, nano-fluid based refrigerants and selectively absorbing solar plate collectors to the system. We will develop a robust simulation model to help with the design process. The system will be partly built using a novel diffusion bonding process that enables dissimilar materials to be joined seamlessly. We will test the adsorption properties of the novel adsorbent materials and apply them to the refrigerator. We aim to deliver a solar adsorption refrigerator that employs nano-technology and novel manufacturing methods, meets the performance improvements currently achievable but not with the bulk and complexity. We expect scholars and industry to also apply the technology demonstrated to several other uses, and for them to be more accessible to the general public. The Fellow has all the necessary skills and experience required (including chemical adsorption, thermodynamics, heat & mass transfer) while the host lab has all the infrastructure and experience of hosting researchers. The project is also timely as it fits into the EU Energy policy (ESTPP Vision 2030).",2016-04-01,2018-03-31,195454.8,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,2

Since 2010, Anteryon has been expanding in providing customized optical solutions for compact optical encoders and spectrometers. As a next step in this roadmap Anteryon envisages to accomplish a breakthrough in user access, size and cost reduction of a fast growing spectroscopic materials analysis technique, namely Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The name Colibri stands for compact LIBS module for advanced materials. The novel Colibri module is carrier for a breakthrough in LIBS and will enable a more efficient, affordable, and more wide-spread use this spectroscopic technology for the analysis of materials. In this way, the increased use of LIBS will also contribute to the social themes and to the efficiency in executing European programs in the field of waste management, environmental protection, ecological footprint reduction, food safety control and health care. 
The Colibri module is a novel architecture and manufacturing platform that will be available as a standard plug-in module for compact, cost-effective, robust reconfigurable and user accessible spectrometers.
The  proposed Colibri  module  satisfies spectrometer users  needs to measure in real-time and in-line without compromising the LIBS spectral accuracy and at affordable costs (at least 4 times lower than the state of the art).  The Colibri module allows reconfiguration of the spectrometer for different applications  by adapting software only. These features will boost the user accessibility and market  size  of affordable LIBS technology.

In fact, the market for the conversion of used cooking oil (UCO) from the hospitality sector into biodiesel is well established. However, even though around 854,000 tonnes of used cooking oil is produced from households in Europe, the extremely promising market of domestic UCO is generally untapped. In Cyprus, this market gap is being addressed by an innovative project that, through a solution-oriented approach, has proven that a harmful waste can be transformed into a source of income and innovation for the most vulnerable groups of our society: children and unemployed youth. Project â€œTiganokinisiâ€ makes schools the collection hubs of domestic used cooking oil, with each student bringing oil from her/his household and neighbourhood. The profit from the sale of the UCO is returned to the school for the implementation of green technologies and infrastructure. The entire initiative is tightly coupled with educational innovation (formal, informal and non-formal education). The project, which overcomes several of the obstacles previously identified in domestic UCO collection and which can become self-sustained within 5 years, promotes resource efficiency and environmental protection, while creating jobs in a niche market of the green economy. It helps Member States meet several EU targets related to the Waste Framework Directive, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy. It has therefore attracted the attention of NGOs around Europe and the world. There is international interest to replicate its success, and therefore there is a business opportunity. As such, ISOTECH, aims to develop a â€œblueprintâ€ that will allow the replication of Tiganokinisi in other countries, through a licensing/franchising scheme that will begin with the implementation of a bundle of consultancy services and support for setting up the project.",2018-03-01,2018-08-31,50000.0,,"['biofuel', 'renewable energy']",2,2

In this context, a more intelligent, responsive, and efficient, system has been devised, known as the Smart Grid (SG). As explained in the EU Third Energy Package the SG will support a dynamic two-way information exchange between utility companies and their customers, contributing towards a smart and sustainable energy management in Europe and the establishment of a wiser energy consumption mentality. However, besides the benefits of such an endeavour, the power grid will be exposed to security threats inherited from the ICT sector, while privacy issues and new vulnerabilities, related to the specific characteristics of the SG infrastructure, will emerge. The problem is assessed as crucial, if we consider that a potential attack to the SG may lead to cascading failures, ranging from destruction of other interconnected critical infrastructures to loss of human lives. Thus, the development of a security platform tailored to the SG is required, that i) can efficiently manage the plethora of SG nodes, ii) deal with potential malicious hardware or software modifications due to the physical access of the customers to the SG nodes, and iii) operate over heterogeneous systems. Considering all the above, SealedGRID aims at bringing together experts from industry and academia from cross-sectorial research areas having complementary background with the long-term goal to design, analyse, and implement a scalable, highly trusted and interoperable SG security platform. The platform will combine, for the very first time, technologies like Blockchain, Distributed Hash Tables, Trusted Execution Environments, and OpenID Connect, while for its realization the SealedGRID consortium is committed to a fully-integrated and multi-disciplinary secondment programme combined with a set of networking, dissemination, and exploitation activities.",2018-01-01,2021-12-31,1080000.0,['Energy management'],['smart grid'],2,2
1160,702435,Supra-CNT,Supramolecular assembly of Janus Carbon Nanotubes into functional 3D microparticles,"The remarkable mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are only valid for individual particles, and are generally lost when bulk CNT materials are integrated in devices. The controlled manufacturing of macroscopic functional and high-performance CNT-materials, retaining the compelling properties of individual tubes, has hence become of paramount importance to allow their full exploitation within commercial products.

With the Supra-CNT project we aim at tackling this compelling issue by performing an unprecedented sequential engineering of the architecture of CNT materials, from the nano-, to the micro- and macroscale level. Specifically, we intend to synthesise Janus amphiphilic CNTs, which will be able to self assemble into well-defined 3D microparticles following the instructions encoded in their pre-organised functionalisation. These structures will then be employed in large area self-assembly to form higher order macro-assemblies (i.e. colloidal crystals), achieving an unprecedented degree of hierarchisation and tailoring of the CNT material.

By providing such controlled multiscale engineering, Supra-CNT will shed light on the structure-property relationships characterising CNT bulk materials. This knowledge will allow for the implementation of a property-conservative manufacturing of CNT-based materials, boosting their performanceâ€“toâ€“cost ratio, and integration in a vast set of applications with high societal and industrial impact, such as high performance filters, catalysts, and energy storage devices.",2016-04-01,2018-11-10,183454.8,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
1161,804092,ME4OER,Mechanism Engineering of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"I propose innovative strategies to elucidate and engineer the electrocatalytic mechanism of earth-abundant transition metal oxides with the aim of enhancing the low efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Mastering multi-electron reactions such as the OER is critical for the transition from dwindling fossil fuels to ecologically and economically sustainable fuels based on renewable energy. Water is the most abundant source of hydrogen bonds on earth and fuels based on these bonds have the highest energy densities, which makes water an attractive resource for sustainable fuels production. However, the production of any hydrogen-based fuel from water is currently thwarted by the low efficiency of the OER. Improved catalysts are presently designed by optimizing a single step in the reaction sequence. In contrast, I target the low efficiency of the OER by engineering multiple steps of the mechanism to (i) control the number of electron transfers before the limiting step; and (ii) enforce a reaction path close to the thermodynamic limit. Combining these two strategies increases the catalytic current of transition metal oxides at typical overpotentials by a factor of 100,000. Rational design of the mechanism on this fundamental level calls for unprecedented insight into the active state of electrocatalysts. My team will achieve this firstly by novel approaches to prepare catalytically limiting states for their elucidation by synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy and secondly by studying transitions between these states in pioneering time-resolved experiments. Both the required breakthroughs in method development and the innovative scientific strategies are generalizable to other multi-electron reactions, which opens the door for industrial catalysts that store energy sustainably in hydrogen-based fuels on a global scale.",2019-03-01,2024-02-29,1499980.0,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,2

Despite this dynamism, the chemical industry is energy intensive and 95 % of organic chemicals derive from fossil oil and natural gas. To sustain the growth of this industry, the replacement of fossil feedstocks with renewable carbon, phosphorus and silicon sources should be encouraged. Nonetheless, such a sourcing shift represents a paradigm shift: while the development of petrochemistry has relied on the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, the conversion of renewable feedstocks (e.g. CO2, phosphates, silicates or biomass) requires efficient reduction methods and catalysts to overcome their oxidized nature.
Today, no reduction method meets the criteria for a versatile and energy efficient reduction of oxidized feedstocks and the aim of the ReNewHydrides project is to design novel reductants and catalytic reactions to achieve this important aim. At the crossroads of main group element chemistry, organometallic chemistry, electrochemistry and homogenous catalysis, I propose to develop innovative and recyclable reductants based on silicon and boron compounds, and to utilize them to tackle catalytic challenges in the reduction of Câ€“O,  Pâ€“O and Siâ€“O bonds. The overarching principle is to build a balanced synthetic cycle, where the electrochemical reduction of functionalized and oxidized substrates is ensured by silicon and boron based hydride donors, with a high energy efficiency and selectivity.
This project will foster innovative routes in the utilization of renewable carbon, phosphorus and silicon feedstocks. It is therefore of high risk, but ultimately extremely rewarding. The results will also also open-up new horizons in silicon and boron chemistry and they will finally serve the scientific community involved in the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry, sustainable chemistry and energy storage.",2019-10-01,2024-09-30,1999837.5,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
1163,725657,COMPUSAPIEN,Computing Server Architecture with Joint Power and Cooling Integration at the Nanoscale,"The soaring demand for computing power in the last years has grown faster than semiconductor technology evolution can sustain, and has produced as collateral undesirable effect a surge in power consumption and heat density in computing servers. Although computing servers are the foundations of the digital revolution, their current designs require 30-40% of the energy supplied to be dissipated in cooling. The remaining energy is used for computation, but their complex many-core designs produce very high operating temperatures. Thus, operating all the cores continuously at maximum performance levels results in system overheating and failures. This situation is limiting the benefits of technology scaling.

The COMPUSAPIEN proposal aims to completely revise the current computing server architecture. In particular, inspired by the mammalian brain, this proposal targets to design a disruptive three-dimensional (3D) computing server architecture that overcomes the prevailing worst-case power and cooling provisioning paradigm for servers. This new 3D server design champions a heterogeneous many-core architecture template with an integrated on-chip microfluidic fuel cell network for joint cooling delivery and power supply. Also, it will include a novel predictive controller based on holistic power-temperature models, which exploit the server software stack to achieve energy-scalable computing capabilities. Because of its integrated electronic-electrochemical architecture design, COMPUSAPIEN is clearly a high-risk high-reward proposal that will bring drastic energy savings with respect to current server design approaches, and will guarantee energy scalability in future server architectures. To realize this vision, COMPUSAPIEN will develop and integrate breakthrough innovations in heterogeneous computing architectures, cooling-power subsystem design, combined microfluidic power delivery and temperature management in computers.",2017-06-01,2022-05-31,1999281.0,['Fuel'],['fuel cell'],2,2

It can be described as a CO2 capture and utilisation, or â€˜CCUâ€™, technology which captures CO2 to create a valuable, safe, carbon neutral or negative end-product which can be used as an aggregate by the construction industry. 

The technology is applicable to hazardous waste from industries including cement, steel and Energy from Waste. These wastes otherwise represent a problem for the waste producer and typically require pre-treatment before transportation to landfill â€“ at a cost of up to 150 Euros per tonne.

Carbon8â€™s technology has already been successfully deployed, under license by a waste management company, at large scale. This Phase 1 Project focuses on the identification of markets and suitable end-products for a small-scale version of the ACT technology - identified as more suitable to customer needs. The compact, containerized processing plant can be integrated into existing industrial processes, utilising CO2 contained in flue gas to treat the industrial waste. It represents a circular economy solution to both industrial waste and CO2 emissions.

 Carbon8 estimates that around 20% of the EUâ€™s 143 million tonnes of reactive waste might be available. These waste streams would have the potential to capture 3.5 Mt of CO2 /year. There is interest from major cement producers: Heidelberg, Lafarge, CRH, and Cemex and from EfW operators, particularly in northern Europe where disposal options are limited and costs highest.

The mission of ARAMIS is to develop and deploy methods, models, techniques and algorithms for the analysis and optimization of industrial components and systems, particularly, in terms of safety, reliability, maintenance, resilience, asset management, etc.

Algo-Grid is based on specifically designed Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) solutions, time series prediction algorithms, energy flow simulators and optimization algorithms, which can provide real-time optimal configurations of smart grids (generation, transmission and distribution), predict and assess infrastructure health condition, incorporate policy-based rule logic.

It has been necessary to do this as the population of the earth shares the same 35 million km3 out of the 1.4 billion km3 water there is. Yet, this raise a new problem as the fossil fuel emits pollutants and speeds up climate change which in turn makes the water shortage problem even worse as it results in higher temperatures and droughts. Solar Water Plc has found another solution. In a laboratory it has been researched and tested that it is possible to use solar power to produce fresh water, suitable for drinking. The laboratory model can now be turned into a real world prototype; Field Demonstrator Model. This project aims at collecting real world data and creating designs for a fully functioning sea water desalination dome, powered 100% by solar energy to create sustainable fresh water for industrial, municipal, agricultural and domestic use. By using concentrated solar power, the technology avoids fossil fuels, is low cost, carbon neutral and low on emission of pollutants. It is the hope that the model can be sold commercially within one year.

Landfilling is the usual method but is the least recommended option since they release GHG, contaminates the soil and ground water, produces unpleasant odours and spread pathogenic microorganisms. Recycling is unable to deal with the huge amount of garbage produced. Mass-burn incineration eliminates waste but emits highly dangerous dioxins and furans creating major social opposition. Composting is limited to large fractions of organic waste and is very odorous. Most of the gasification plants that started to operate have shut down failing to provide a solution to the problem.

Regularly, huge data centers are opened for storage or calculation of numerical data. Needs, including calculation power, are becoming increasingly important, which explains the creation and implementation of more and more of these data centers. However, the past few years have shown that these clusters are particularly energy-consuming not only because of the calculations but also because of the cooling systems.

The idea is to sale processing power on the cloud. The calculations are smartly distributed to a remote computing grid. The grid is composed of calculation units that are actually electric heaters. The heat is produced by the processors that perform the computing.

Qarnot computing sales cloud HPC on one end, and refunds  the electricity used by electric heaters on the other end. This solution allows Qarnot to build progressively a scalable computing grid avoiding the massive investments of a data center. Furthermore, there is no need to cool the infrastructure as the heat is directly used for heating purposes. Seasonality has already been taken into account by using CPU low power mode, install calculation units in strategic hosts such as schools that are closed during summer. In addition, computing power demand is seasonal, there is less jobs to perform during summer. Qarnot computing grid will be able to guarantee all year long a certain capacity, the extra power will be offered for free to universities and will be used as an adjustment variable (to meet the needs for calculation and the needs for heat).

Qarnot can therefore propose a very energy efficient cloud HPC for reasonable prices. This is one key to address the HPC market which already represents billions of euros.

The present study will evaluate the feasibility of energy storage and supply system for off-grid applications, based on the microturbine technology, characterized by being low costs, low carbon, flexible, robust and easy to maintain. From a business standpoint, the market need for a similar device was realized by the experience of the proposer in the oil&gas industry. In this context, having a local and distributed energy generation in smart distribution grids represents a potential for cost saving and performance improvements:  for example, leakages can be detected by distributed sensors and information sent via wireless transmitters, powered by the microturbine. The microturbine can be used in two operating modes:
â€¢ As micro-turbo expander exploiting available pressure drops for generating electricity to power up delocalized sensors and transmitters.
â€¢ As air-powered generator, supplying critical loads for short periods, taking energy from a pressurized tank.
Three main objectives shall be reached during the feasibility: a first validation of the technical concepts, a detailed picture of the markets (smart distribution grids, remote off-grid repeaters and possible niches) and a refined business model and plan. On these results, Advanced Microturbines S.r.l. is willing to base the application for phase2. In line with its objectives, the study will include the following activities:
Analysis of the technical scenario and concept design: trends and current IPR scenarios, preliminary list of technology suppliers and potential future partners.

1174,673373,Collect and Reflect,Reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint by implementing Collect and Reflect(TM) blinds for solar energy collection and reflection (Collect and Reflect),"Rising energy bills is a relevant topic for households in the European Union. The share of household income spent on energy bills is growing and is impacting not only low-income households. Many of existing solutions for lowering energy bills for households are expensive and are targeted at home owners. They include new passive buildings, better insulation of existing buildings and/or generation of locally renewable energy (e.g. geo-thermic, solar, wind). 
Even though many already proven solutions exist that aim to increase energy efficiency and energy production in buildings via walls and roofs, windows are usually considered as a subject of energy loss and not taken into account for sustainable energy production. Could we optimize certain features of windows, such as blinds, and how should we do it? We believe that in the future, window blinds could add additional warmth in the winter and help to keep rooms cool in the summer; become a source of light; produce electricity; and when needed, block or let light in. By working on the Collect & Reflect project, SaulÄ—s vÄ—jo aruodai (SVA) is making first steps to realize this dream by inventing blinds that can heat and cool.
SVA, an SME from Lithuania, invents, patents, makes and supplies solar energy transformation products. Recently SVA has invented a break-through solution, Collect & Reflect(TM) thermal blinds, which can help save energy and thus reduce energy bills and decrease the carbon footprint of households. These blinds have innovative technology and special coating that make rooms warmer during the winter and colder in the summer. They help to decrease the need to heat and cool rooms, which results in lower energy bills and lower CO2 emissions. Collect & Reflect(TM) thermal blinds have huge potential to affect the window treatment market worldwide and transform traditional blinds into an active energy saving tool accessible for any household.",2015-02-01,2015-07-31,50000.0,['Wind'],['renewable energy'],2,2
1175,789315,D-NOSES,"Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability","Odour pollution is the second reason for citizensâ€™ complaints after noise, across Europe. Frequent exposure to odour is associated with headache, stress and respiratory problems. Odour nuisance is an indicator of larger environmental issues, such as poor waste management or polluted water. Yet, odour pollution has repeatedly been ignored in environmental regulations leaving citizens defenceless. Due to the lack of regulation, situated technical studies are rarely conducted and data and statistics on odour pollution are scarce or difficult to access. D-NOSES aims to provide a solution to this largely neglected problem by reversing the way in which odour pollution is commonly tackled. Our approach is to empower citizens with RRI, citizen science and co-creation tools to become drivers of change. D-NOSES promotes a quadruple helix model that will be applied at local, national and global levels. Through the International Odour Observatory, we will guarantee access to information in odour pollution. We will co-design citizen science interventions across 7 European and 3 non-European countries, where citizens will use innovative mapping tools to crowdsource odour issues and co-create ad-hoc solutions with CSOs, NGOs, local public authorities, odour emitting industries and academia. Advocacy actions, together with project results, such as DIY Guidelines for project replicability, scientific guidelines for policy making and The Green Paper on Odour Pollution, will be used as policy tools with the ultimate aim of introducing odour pollution in the policy agenda. A â€˜Strategic Roadmap on Odour Pollutionâ€™ will pave the way for bottom-up, multi-level governance for increased sustainability in the medium to long term.

As the majority of these people are located in remote and rural areas of the world, where conventional power grid extensions are not possible, off-grid energy solutions are required for providing electricity to these areas. Even though such solutions exist today, the options available are painfully limited and costly, whether it be the polluting diesel generators or the solar panels, intermittent energy source requiring complex parks of batteries for energy storage.
Tackling this issue, our company, EDIE EcoCinetic, a technology-driven micro-enterprise, has invented EcoCurrent, a water current picoturbine which harnesses the energy from the available flow of canals, rivers and tidal currents to generate electricity. Specifically design for water, our technology is compact, robust, efficient, easy to install and operate; and will provide to rural and remote population a solution adapted to their hydrokinetic resources to address their needs for a continuous, reliable and affordable electricity.
With EcoCurrent, our universal and affordable technology which will improve living conditions of millions of people in Europe and abroad, we aim to become one of the international leaders in the emerging market of hydrokinetic picoturbines.

1177,782319,ROBIOT,Improving the sustainability of bioenergy production with a Robot for Biomass Quality Management,"Renewable energy generation and biofuels are replacing fossil-based energy sources and decarbonizing the energy system. However, one problem still limits the optimal and efficient use of biomass for energy and other applications: the varying biomass feedstock quality causes 5-10% of extra operating costs at a typical power plant. The quality fluctuation can be dealt with by optimising the feedstock mix and plant processes based on the feedstock quality. However, this is only possible when real-time information of the quality of each raw material load is available. The conventional quality measurement methods cannot provide such data.  

Prometec Tools has developed an automated solution, the Q-Robot, that renews the raw material quality management at biomass power plants and biorefineries. It eliminates the error caused by conventional sampling procedures and provides information of each biomass delivery before it is unloaded from the truck. Moreover, since it makes load-specific information available also to the feedstock supplier, Prometecâ€™s solution enables a completely new level of intelligent biomass quality management across the whole supply chain. The solution benefits the end user (plant), the feedstock supplier as well as the consumer and the society at large by improving the resource and cost efficiency (and therefore also the sustainability) of biomass supply and use. 

Prometec aims at becoming the leading European service provider for feedstock quality management at biomass power plants, pulp mills and biorefineries - a global multi-billion-euro market. The novel solution is estimated to create 800 000 â‚¬ of annual savings at an 800 GWh power plant and its expected payback time is less than 12 months. The net savings potential in Europe in 2020 is 0,8 Bâ‚¬. The solution helps reduce CO2 emissions not only in the supply chain and at the plant but also by making biomass more competitive and therefore a more favourable fuel feedstock compared to coal.",2017-08-01,2018-01-31,50000.0,['Fuel'],['renewable energy'],2,2

1179,811532,BlockPLA,Innovative nanostructured PLA polymer to expand suitable uses of biodegradable packaging,"Bioplastics are an essential part of our efforts to reduce pollution and increase sustainability. Of these, the most ecoefficient bioplastic is PLA as it is biodegradable, requires 50% less energy and produces 10 times less emissions in comparison to standard thermoplastics like PET and PP. Furthermore, as it does not need to be recycled, it not only saves the energy and cost involved, but also the fact that only a fraction of the plastic produced reaches the recycling plant, the rest ending up in landfill or the sea.
However, biodegradable plastics only make up approximately 0.2% of plastics produced in 2014. This is because conventional PLA has certain technical limitations which reduce the number of marketable applications where it can be used. For example, it cannot compete with standard thermoplastic grades used in packaging applications (such as PET and PE), in terms of oxygen and water vapour barrier and thermal properties, which are the most demanded properties for packaging requirements. 
Advanced & Functional Technologies for Biocomposites S.L (ADBIOCOMPOSITES) has developed an innovative, biodegradable PLA grade named BlockPLA which has enhanced technical properties: oxygen and water vapour barrier, thermal stability, transparency and flexibility. BlockPLA solves the drawbacks that PLA currently shows for packaging applications. In addition, BlockPLA has food contact approval and requires less energy to be produced. Production costs are slightly lower than conventional PLA. Therefore, BlockPLA is a real biodegradable alternative to PET, PP and PLA for packaging applications in the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical and biomedical industry, home care packaging, cosmetics industry and others. 
ADBIOCOMPOSITES aims to use the SME instrument to scale up the production of BlockPLA and bring it to the packaging market, generating 37 new jobs and above â‚¬10 million revenues.",2018-05-01,2019-12-31,989501.63,,"['recycling', 'bioplastic']",2,2

The innovative core of microgeneration is an ORC cycle operating with a significantly lower inlet temperature of less than 60Â°C that allows for utilising heat from cooling systems  that have not yet been used due to the absence of an applicable technology. The system offers higher electrical efficiency and higher flexibility to different inlet temperatures than comparable systems. This opens a tremendous range of new applications opportunities of distributed, sustainable electricity generation based on recovering waste heat. The Î¼ORC system offers the unique opportunity to implement microgeneration in target markets with cold food storage, incl. food processing, food and beverage retail and service providers, and accommodation, which are producing considerable amounts of waste heat and which are potentially counting for ~10 % of the energy consumption in Europe. The commercial potential corresponds to 2.5 million installations in Europe at the moment.
The feasibility assessment shall prepare the commercialisation of the super-low temperature ORC based Î¼CHP system and elaborate a detailed business plan. In particular it defines a roadmap for further product development and identifies market areas and the specific target groups. The study investigates the details of customer needs and expected market structures, proves the technical and economic viability of the technology and prepares technical requirements, product documentation and data sheets.
The developed technology directly contributes to European societal challenges such as reducing the consumption of fossil resources and the emission of greenhouse gases and it facilitates low-cost and low-carbon decentralised energy generation. Moreover it contributes to the implementation of the Microgeneration Resolution of the European Parliament (2012/2930 RSP).",2015-03-01,2015-07-31,50000.0,['Storage'],['CHP'],2,2

Complementary Currencies (CC) are a type of money designed to circulate alongside the Central Bankâ€™s money to address objectives that the conventional money system does not. CC are tied to a specific demarcated community (i.e. locality, mutual-credit networks, sectoral vouchers). The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) engages the organisation and its beneficiaries and performs a study of its structure and operation at a particular point in time and place.
The study will further organizational theory for sustainability and community building, contributing to the Europe 2020 strategy. It builds upon previous efforts funded by the European Union, namely Digipay4growth  and CCIA, by studying the social and economic impact of these projects in order to further theorise CC from a systems and complexity theory perspective. The research will link micro-impact indicators at an organizational level, such as employment generation and access to financial services, with macro indicators at the national level, such as the enhanced GDP that includes well-being and life satisfaction, according to the Beyond GDP initiative of the European Commission. 
The research on CCs as an anti-crisis mechanism is topical at a time when the European Union member states and especially Greece are striving to cope with the financial crisis and its impact on national economies and societies. Several countries have experienced GDP declines and rising unemployment rates, while in Greece the indicators are even worse than during the Great Depression. In that line, the priorities of Europe 2020 include community currencies because of their effectiveness towards social innovation, new modes of sustainable economy, employment and enterprise creation, and local regeneration.",2016-09-01,2019-03-01,177598.8,['CCS'],['CCS'],2,2

But a new EU directive, designed to save some of the 420,000 lives lost every year to air pollution in the EU, means that todayâ€™s technologies cannot meet the demands by any other means than adding expensive emission reduction systems to their solutions. This will make energy from biomass more expensive, lead to higher energy bills for consumers and threatens to put the Commissionâ€™s entire renewable energy roadmap at risk.    Dall Energy has developed a new, disruptive biomass furnace that reduces dust and particle emissions by more than 90% and can easily meet the demands in the new directive, and offer a whole new set of other benefits: â€¢ 30% lower investment (much simpler design) â€¢ 50% lower maintenance costs (no technical difficulties, low power consumption)  â€¢ Very wide load window (fast and easy modulation between 10 and 100% load without problems) â€¢ Up to 40% reduction of fuel cost as the technology enables conversion of a wide range of low-value fuels such as wet biomass, organic waste streams, willow, etc. in the same furnace.   For Dall Energy, there is a market of 150-250 new plants and 130-170 replacement plants annually in EU-28 alone.

Their stories often contain more hope, ambition and imagination as portrayed in reports and scientific publications. Their ability to bounce back despite disadvantageous ecological, economic and political settings implies a new form of normality framed outside traditional city development models.
ACTUS is concerned with people's everyday experiences of solid waste and sanitation in peri-urban areas to discern the interdependences between urban infrastructure, pro-poor growth and climate hazards. In ACTUS I place a particular focus on local processes of adaptation and self-organization to cope with increasing flooding impacts in East Africa. The lens of everyday experiences of waste management and sanitation offers an innovative approach to expend our understanding on multiple spheres of livelihoods considering how local processes and technologies may act as a benefit for the poor and may trigger sustainable technical infrastructure

Instead of disposal/landfilling â€“ that regularly causes pollution of natural water resources â€“ it would be more beneficial to produce sludge pellets. Such experiences drove us to create the InnoPellet technology, a self-supporting biofuel pellet producing system for treating communal sewage sludge that is economical in case of small scale production too. 

Five years of research and development led to the successful completion of a prototype machine that received regulatory approval and third-party testing/validation. After finalising the InnoPellet technology, our primary goal is to commercialise the units and relating pelleting services to wastewater companies primarily in Europe and later on the world market as well.
The InnoPellet system offers an economical solution of sewage sludge treatment for wastewater companies. Our technology is a self-supporting machinery for drying and pelleting sewage sludge without external need of fossil fuel or any other additional material.

Among various options of SE, the EU has 33.3 GWth of solar thermal technology (a High Heat Flux Removing Device: HHFRD, one among the target groups of this project) saving 4.3 million tonnes of CO2 emission per year. However, the current research proves that the Two-Phase Flow Instabilities (TPFI) act as major hindrances in improving the efficiency of such HHFRDs. The TPFIs are known by large-scale fluctuations of flow causing pressure fluctuations, departure from a steady state, & mechanical vibrations to a system. Although the vast research on TPFIs began almost 80 years ago, the primary focus has been to identify the limits of conditions with & without oscillations & alternative control mechanisms. Today, to extract heat cost-effectively; force the HHFRDs to work in conditions close to these limits or even in the presence of TPFIs. However, the influence of such oscillations on the heat transfer (HT) is scarcely studied. Hence, the objective of this project is to quantify the influence of TPFIs on the HT & to provide a transient HT model to attain better & reliable control techniques. The ER (experienced researcher) will do this by combining experiments on HT during TPFIs in the experimental facility at the host & numerical techniques (LSSE: Least Square Spectral Element method) capable of dealing with the highly transient behavior of the TPFIs. The ER will learn new numerical method LSSE, experimental methodology & data acquisition technique. This will boost the ERâ€™s present research capability (limited to numerical analysis) to experimental investigations of various RE technologies.

Hydrogen is a promising renewable fuel, but so far its production is not clean as the conventional industrial techniques start from fossil fuels. Production of H2 by biological, biotechnological or bioinspired methods would solve this problem and the study of FeFe-hydrogenases is a key step in this process. For this reason, the proposal is well aligned with the EU Societal Challenges in â€œSecure, clean and efficient energyâ€. FeFe-hydrogenases are efficient metalloenzymes that catalyse H2 production from water at high turnover rates, using Fe, rather than Pt active sites. Building on my previous experience with these enzymes, in this project I will apply a highly innovative approach to investigate how nature uses cheap iron to catalyse H2 production. Protein film infrared (IR) electrochemistry was recently developed by Prof Vincent at the University of Oxford, allowing electrochemical triggering of enzyme catalysis with simultaneous IR spectroscopic study of how the enzyme works. This will provide a deep understanding of enzyme structure/function relationships, from coordinated electron and proton transfer to structural rearrangements at the Fe site. Due to my prior expertise in FeFe hydrogenases which are not studied in the host group, and Oxfordâ€™s excellence in bio-spectroscopy, the Fellowship will promote exceptional bidirectional knowledge transfer. Dissemination of research through Oxfordâ€™s outreach programs will increase the impact of the project to varied audiences.

To fully use their potential, radical new technologies that allow the synthesis of complex, and multicomponent crystalline materials with specific size and morphology are required. While the reactive spray technology is already a key element for the scalable and economic synthesis of metal oxides, we will fundamentally advance the strength of the reactive spray processes by generating a knowledge-base for sulphide/nitride materials through our ReSuNiCo project. We will achieve this goal with a fast, safe, versatile, time and resource efficient high throughput single droplet combustion screening that identifies complete new reaction schemes and processes as we highlighted in Nature news. The method is highly flexible and adaptable to a large variety of reactive liquids and gas atmospheres that readily comply with the safety requirements via small volumes, small liquid streams and gas flows. We will establish in-situ process diagnostics in order to identify droplet reactions, particle formation pathways and product characteristics. We will use this knowledge to build standard and inverted (fuels and sulfidizers/nitridizers are exchanged in the reactive spray) lab-scale reactors that serve as demonstrators to transfer the first material samples into performance evaluations in specific applications. The objectives and work packages of ReSuNiCo reach far beyond the state of the art materials synthesis exploration and calls for new process innovations in reactive spraying technologies, aerosol and gas phase characterizations, process model formulations and particle synthesis.

1193,796272,LOWCOST-PBI-HTPEMFC,Novel binder-ionomer-free electrodes enable ultra-low Pt loading electrodes for low cost High Temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells based in phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole membranes,"In spite of the promising prospects as future green energy conversion device, low temperature-proton exchange membrane fuel cells (LT-PEMFCs) based in perfluorosulfonic acid membrane have achieved a penetration in the energy market rather low, being cost and durability the main barriers to the worldwide commercialization. As an alternative, high temperature- (HT-) PEMFCs based in phosphoric acid-doped polybenzimidazole membranes are gaining much of attention due to the benefits over the LT-PEMFCs (e.g. no need of auxiliary humidification system, much higher CO and sulfur tolerance, very suitable for cogeneration in combined heat and power systems, easier thermal management, etc.). However, the main drawback is the high Pt content of the electrodes that, according to the state-of-the-art, is greater than 0.5 mgPt cm-2 (2-5 times higher than LT-PEMFCs state-of-the-art). This project aims to develop a novel configuration of the HT-PEMFC electrode that enable the achievement of low cost ultra-low Pt loading electrodes (â‰¤ 0.1 mgPt cm-2) with competitive power output and durability. A paradigm shift is proposed in the structure and composiition of the catalytic layer of the HT-PEMFC electrode as no ionomer or binder is incorporated, only the catalyst and the electrolyte (phosphoric acid) are present. The absence of Pt site-blockers, as the binder or the ionomer polymers, significantly enhance the electrochemical surface area at  ultra-low Pt loadings enabling a reasonable performace output. Results of this project have a strong potential to be transferred to the electrode production in the emerging industry of HT-PEMFCs. The project involves a number of analytic techniques and specific equipment that ensures the transfer of knowledge and the training to the experienced researcher while the candidate will bring his expertise in LT-PEMFCs as a positive feedback to the HT-PEMFCs research field.",2018-08-15,2020-08-14,212194.8,['Fuel'],['combined heat and power'],2,2

Being at the source of innovative applications in the fields of biotechnologies, pharmacology, energy storage and food industry, capsules offer tremendous potential in the process engineering world. But scientific challenges remain to be met, such as finding the optimal compromise between payload and membrane thickness, characterizing the membrane resistance and controlling the moment of rupture. 
The project explores the use of deformable liquid-core capsules of micrometric size to efficiently transport active material, with a primary focus on health-related applications. We will design innovative sophisticated numerical models and high-tech experiments, needed to determine the potential of such vectors for the protection of active substances, predict membrane breakup to control the delivery, and optimize their properties for specific industrial and biomedical applications. The project will, for the first time, study the effect of a finite wall thickness on the dynamics of elastic microcapsules, propose advanced modelling approaches and microfluidic experiments of their deformability and breakup under hydrodynamic stresses, account for the inherent size variability of given capsule populations, and introduce reduced-order models to facilitate real-time simulations. As a specific application, we will study the potential of liquid-core microcapsules to encapsulate antioxidants for food enrichment. 
The project outcomes will be (i) new advanced three-dimensional numerical models of the fluid-structure interactions and rupture of a microcapsule, taking into account a finite wall thickness, (ii) microcapsule optimization tools based on reduced-order models, (iii) microscopic techniques to measure the capsule mechanical properties, and (iv) an applied study of optimization of antioxidant encapsulation in microcapsules.",2018-06-01,2023-05-31,1999470.0,['Storage'],['energy storage'],2,2
1195,770889,ULTRA,Increasing the Spatial Correlation of Logical Units of Data to Enable an Ultra-Low Latency Internet,"The cloud computing infrastructure that logically centralizes data storage and computation for many different actors is a prime example of a key societal system. A number of time-critical applications deployed in the cloud infrastructure have to provide high reliability and throughput, along with guaranteed low latency for delivering data. This low latency guarantee is sorely lacking today, with the so-called tail-latency of slowest responses in popular cloud services being several orders of magnitude longer than the median response times. Unfortunately, simply using a network with ample bandwidth does not guarantee low latency because of problems with congestion at the intra-and inter-data center levels and server overloads. All of these problems currently render the existing cloud infrastructures unsuitable for time-critical societal applications. The reasons for unpredictable delays across the Internet and within the cloud infrastructure are numerous, but some of the key culprits are: 1) slow memory subsystems limit server effectiveness, and 2) excess buffering in the Internet further limits correlation of data requests.

The aim of this project is to dramatically change the way data flows across the Internet, such that it is more highly correlated when it is to be processed at the servers. The overarching goal is to enforce a large degree of correlation in the data requests (logical units of data), both temporally (across time) and spatially (as server work units require correlation to achieve high cache hit rates). The result is that the logical units of data will be processed at almost the maximum processing speed of the cloud servers. By doing so, we will achieve an ultra-low latency Internet. This project will produce the tools and knowledge that will be key to dramatically reducing the latency of key societal services; these include cloud services used by a large number of users on a daily basis.",2018-06-01,2023-05-31,2000000.0,['Storage'],['data center'],2,2

The state of the art of de novo self-assembling protein nanomaterials is based on the design of protein-protein interfaces. However, due to the complex interplay of numerous weak interactions at the interface the success rate of designed assemblies is currently below 10%. This proposal aims to increase the success rate of designing large protein assemblies, by using coiled-coils (CC) at the interface. CCs are some of the best understood protein motifs and can be designed with high success rates (>50%). A set of well-defined building blocks (CC-LEGOs) will be created by rigidly fusing CC bundles and natural oligomerization domains. Due to precise control of crossing angles enabled by the rigid fusion we expect that CC-LEGO structures will have the high design success rate and high solution homogeneity needed for further applications. A toolbox of CC-LEGO blocks will be designed and experimentally tested, capable of forming cages (tetrahedra, cubes, dodecahedra) as well as open 2D lattices.

The experienced researcher (ER) will gain new programming and wet lab skills for protein design through performing world-class research at one of the worldâ€™s top universities in a group of a world leader in this field. The expected high impact publications and networking opportunities, coupled with the acquired soft skills in project writing, management, leadership and communication will ensure ERâ€™s competitiveness and enable a successful start of his independent career.

1197,759743,WU TANG,Selective Conversion of Water and CO2 Using Interfacial Electrochemical Engineering,"The recycling of CO2 will play an important role in mitigating the energy and environmental problems that our future societies will no doubt face.  Electrochemistry is a powerful technology that can make use of renewable electricity from solar and wind to power the transformation of CO2 and water to valuable chemicals and fuels.  However, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 is not ready for large-scale deployment due to the poor activity, selectivity, and stability of the current catalysts used. The only way to be able to achieve better understanding of this complicated system is through careful characterization of the catalyst/electrolyte interface during electrochemical measurements, as well as the development of new theoretical models that include the effects of the electrolyte.
 In this proposal, I will develop an integrated approach to study the effects of the catalyst and electrolyte compositions on the formation of desired chemical products during electrochemical CO2 reduction.
 To ensure a robust model of the catalyst/electrolyte interface can be established, I will focus on manipulating the catalyst and electrolyte compositions in parallel, while observing the formation of reaction intermediates as a function of applied potential. The proposal will focus on Cu-based electrodes, as Cu has uniquely shown the ability to form hydrocarbon products.  To understand how the product formation changes, operando techniques will be used to monitor the reaction intermediates during electrochemical cycling, to reveal new insights to the reaction pathway for a given product.  A theoretical model will be developed in parallel that focuses on understanding the nature of the electrochemical activity of ions used in this reaction.  Finally, the transport and reactivity of these ions will be evaluated in use with a bipolar membrane, which can effectively separate the electrochemical environments of the CO2 reduction reaction and corresponding water oxidation reaction.",2017-11-01,2022-10-31,2000000.0,['Wind'],['recycling'],2,2

Fast actions are required to decrease the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, value that has currently reaching 400 ppm. Among the technological possibilities that are on the table to reduce CO2 emissions, carbon capture and storage into geological deposits is one of the main strategies that is being applied. However, the final objective of this strategy is to remove CO2 without considering the enormous potential of this molecule as a source of carbon for the production of valuable compounds. Nature has developed an effective and equilibrated mechanism to concentrate CO2 and fixate the inorganic carbon into organic material (e.g., glucose) by means of enzymatic action. Mimicking Nature and take advantage of millions of years of evolution should be considered as a basic starting point in the development of smart and highly effective processes. In addition, the use of amino-acid salts for CO2 capture is envisaged as a potential approach to recover CO2 in the form of (bi)carbonates. 
The project CO2LIFE presents the overall objective of developing a chemical process that converts carbon dioxide into valuable molecules using membrane technology. The strategy followed in this project is two-fold: i) CO2 membrane-based absorption-crystallization process on basis of using amino-acid salts, and ii) CO2 conversion into glucose or salts by using enzymes as catalysts supported on or retained by membranes. The final product, i.e. (bi)carbonates or glucose, has a large interest in the (bio)chemical industry, thus, new CO2 emissions are avoided and the carbon cycle is closed.

1199,754162,COMPETE4SECAP,Energy management competition for local authorities for uptake and enhance of Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans,"All over Europe, a good level of knowledge about Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) development has been reached. There are different good quality methodologies and guidelines available. However, currently municipalities struggle to implement these action plans. There are different reasons for that; one of the most important is the fact that often municipal employees do not feel engaged and are not motivated to take any sort of actions and initiatives, unless someone has actually â€œobligedâ€ them. In many cases, this lack of engagement and commitment ends up with investments in energy efficiency that do not deliver expected technical and economic outcomes. Hence, the energy efficiency potential is not fully exploited and worse suboptimal investments do not provide expected yields. Moreover, local authorities (LAs) more often are facing also challenges regarding climate resilient infrastructure and climate adaptation. The level of knowledge and understanding is even scarcer as regarding climate mitigation. 
COMPETE4SECAP is designed to deliver a systematic approach to energy savings in local authorities using energy management systems (EnMS) according to ISO 50001 or European Energy Award with dedicated online monitoring tool and energy saving competitions. EnMS and competitions when combined can trigger significant benefits by providing innovative and efficient way to involve municipalities that have already their SEAPs but do not act in order to foster their integrated development at local level. Trained and engaged municipal employees will be able to better implement energy efficiency projects, which then require higher investments. An EnMS will help the LA to have reliable data for informed decision and further help in monitoring and evaluation of implemented projects. The use of renewable energy and integration of climate adaptation will also be facilitated through EnMS with the set of procedures from an environmental management system (e.g. IS0 140001).",2017-10-01,2020-09-30,1784983.75,['Energy management'],['renewable energy'],2,2

The consortium aims to replace a significant part of fossil based polyesters (such as PET), but also technologically superior packaging materials like glass and aluminum with 100 % bio-based polyesters (such as PEF). The unique properties of PEF (excellent barrier and strength) make it a material that can be applied in areas where PET is less suitable. The initial market focus will be on high value applications such as replacement of multilayer packaging, aluminum cans and small size PET bottles where PEF brings most value. On the longer term, when FDCA is produced at large scale and technology is further matured, FDCA based polyesters are expected to penetrate further into markets which allow smaller or no price premium. 

The potential significant reductions in non-renewable energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil based PET or aluminum based cans for PEF based packaging solutions will be assessed. Furthermore, PEF bottles can be recycled and used again as raw material for bottles, as well as in a cascading approach for packaging and textiles. During the project, fructose produced via an enzymatic isomerisation process from 2nd generation glucose will be assessed. The full value chain will be optimized ensuring cost-effective and environmentally sustainable raw material sourcing and production of FDCA, PEF/PBF and polyurethane products.

Neutron beam-based analysis (neutron diffraction, neutron activation analysis, active interrogation) and imaging (radiography, tomography) methods are a powerful tool for non-destructive testing (NDT) of materials and find numerous important applications in industry, security, and material science and technology.
Use of laser-driven ion accelerators to generate neutrons can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional neutrons sources.
Within the ERC-CoG ENSURE project, I developed a nanostructured material, used to produce a novel multi-layer target concept] allowing to enhance the laser-ion production efficiency with reduced laser requirements and, at the same time, robust enough to be adopted in a commercial targetry device, paving the way for operation with relatively low-energy, commercial, high rep-rate laser systems (1J; 1-10TW; 10-100 Hz).

Development of the innovative methodology for the strategic market behaviour is highly required by all electricity market parts under permanently changing market conditions. For example, generating companies acting on the market compete with each other in serving the consumers' demand and have the opportunity to optimize the use of their production portfolio by pricing and bidding their available production capacity into the market.

By 2030 the world will have to produce 50% more food and energy and 30% more water. Consequently, most countries are implementing programs to reduce carbon emissions and enhance renewable energy production. 
MAD is the most widespread technology for the treatment of sewage sludge, the by-product of sewage treatment. This natural process uses bacteria to break down biodegradable material and produces a biogas rich in methane. The current drive to maximise energy recovery means that biogas from MAD is increasingly harnessed by combined heat and power technology. Thus, there exists the need to optimise digester performance to maximize energy recovery.
The benefits of improved performance go beyond CO2 reductions, as they will facilitate environmental improvements, reduce operating costs and improve the financial performance of the European and global wastewater industry. The challenge is to improve digester control to minimize excessive mixing, so eliminating additional, unnecessary environmental and financial costs whilst maximising biogas output.
We will simulate for the first time the complex relationships between hydrodynamic and microbiological processes in a MAD environment, whilst also recognising the potential for grit sedimentation within digesters. We will extend significantly previous work and use coupled CFD/MAD modelling as an innovative and robust technique to monitor and control the hydraulic and biochemical performance of MAD.

Particularly, many efforts have been made recently to synthesize efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to carbon fuels using renewable electricity. Nevertheless, to meet the requirement of industrial implementation, even the best performance of these recently developed electrocatalysts must be increased by one order of magnitude. Currently, energy efficiency of CO2 electroreduction is limited by energy-loss in catholyte and transport of CO2 to the cathode surface. The importance of transport limitations will grow as currents approach the higher levels required for industry.

1209,761495,PCBRec,PCBRec process: Waste Printed Circuit Board (WPCB) Recycling with Molten Salts,"The ambition of Composite Recycling Ltd is to establish its patented PCBRec process, as a cost and environmentally preferred process for the treatment of all types of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs).  Every year about 400,000 tons of WPCBs are generated in Europe of which over 90% are land filled or incinerated; resulting a large loss of valuable metals such as copper, gold, silver, solder, indium etc.  Printed circuit boards are used in almost all electronic equipment such as televisions, computers or mobile phones.  Hence PCBRec is an important contribution of solving a large EU and indeed global solid waste problem.

The PCBRec technology disrupts the WPCB recycling market by offering many significant advantages over current technologies:
â€¢ Yields: over 95% recovery rate of copper, steel and solder as established by laboratory and pilot plant trials, which showed that the PCBRec process greatly exceeds the yields of current technologies of about 70-80%.
â€¢ Critical metals: for the first time critical metals may be recyclable from WPCBs.
â€¢ All types of PCBs: not just high value WPCBs.
â€¢ Scalability: the technology is modular, allowing capacity increases in a systematic fashion.
â€¢ Simple reactor from established industries (hot dip galvanising): no moving parts minimising capital costs.

The IRR of a PCBRec plant is estimated to be over 15% for low value and 80% for medium value WPCBs.  These IRR figures exclude recovery of precious metals such as gold or silver.  Over 15 plants with throughputs of 15-20,000 t/y and CAPEX of â‚¬8.5 million are required in Europe.  Worldwide some additional 40 plants are required resulting, overall, in a large market.  

In Europe significant regulatory drivers exist for the further development of the PCBRec technology in form of the WEEE Directive and the drive towards the circular economy.  Many US states, Canada, Australia and Japan legislate WEEE similar to Europe, turning the PCBRec process into a global business opportunity.",2017-02-01,2017-07-31,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,2

C2B process is based on Oakbioâ€™s proprietary microbial strain, which uses CO2 from any flue gas and hydrogen (H2) as a feedstock to produce n-butanol, a valuable drop-in biofuel. In fact, n-butanol is primarily used to make durable acrylic plastics, but is also a superior biofuel, which addresses a massive market as a potential gasoline replacement. Oakbioâ€™s microbial strain grows in a standard fermenter that can be located next to the flue stack of the factories (cement plants, power plants and refineries). It can capture flue gas directly at the point source with minimal retrofitting. This will allow such factories to cut 70% of their direct GHG emissions, while the n-butanol production adds a significant revenue stream to their bottom line: Oakbio estimates a return of more than â‚¬25 per t/CO2 captured.",2017-01-01,2017-04-30,50000.0,,['biofuel'],1,2

However, a large part of this energy is wasted because almost half of the EU's buildings have boilers installed before 1992, with an efficiency rate of below 60%. Transition has started with the deployment of regulatory measures (Energy Efficiency Directive, Building Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy Labelling Directive, national building codesâ€¦) and the prospect of substantial savings in heating and hot water expenses. 

boostHEAT is positioned right at the front of this transition towards energy efficiency. The company has developed a new generation of boilers, heat pump boilers, that use the heat pump effect to reduce by 50% energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. At the core of this achievement is a novel thermodynamic compressor, which is used to increase the efficiency of the heating cycle. Performance of the Apache boiler can double that of condensing boilers and is competitive with the most efficient electric heat pumps

boostHEAT was founded in 2011 in France. Early on, they received the interest of high profile industry participants. GRDF (main natural gas distribution company in France) and Dalkia (leader in energy services) amongst others. Today boostHEAT employs 32 professionals (of which 22 are engineers), has filled 5 patents all around the word and raised over â‚¬4.5 million in private capital. 

boostHEAT ambition is to progressively become an industrial group. We have reached an agreement with the industrial group Bosch to progressively develop our manufacturing operations at their site in VÃ©nissieux, providing a regeneration opportunity to the declined activity of the factory.

The goal of the Apache project is to bring the Apache boilers (20kW) to a state of serial production and commercialization, that will enable the most efficient heating systems to be installed in renovations of individual homes.",2016-12-01,2017-02-28,50000.0,,['heat pump'],1,2

Research activities developed by AFINET partners indicates that appropriate application of AF principles and practices is a key avenue to help the European Union to achieve more sustainable methods of food and fibre production, producing both profits for farmers and environmental benefits. However up to now exists a lack of AF knowledge among end-users that prevent the correct implementation of these practices.
In this sense AFINET will act at EU level in order to take up research results into agricultural practice, improving knowledge exchange between scientists and practitioners on AF activities, with a special focus on silvoarable and silvopastoral systems design, management, and production and profitability. To achieve this objective AFINET consortium proposes an innovative methodology based on: (i) The creation of a EU reservoir of scientific and practical knowledge of AF with an end-user-friendly access (the â€œKnowledge Cloudâ€). (ii) The creation of a European Interregional network (composed of â€œRegional Agroforestry Innovation Networksâ€ - RAINs) considering a multi-actor approach (including farmers, policy makers, advisory services, extension services, etc.), and articulated through the figure of the â€œInnovation Brokerâ€. These RAINs groups will be interconnected in nine strategic regions of Europe from Spain, UK, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Poland, France and Finland, representing different climatic, geographical, social, and cultural conditions at European level.

The objective is to achieve a zero-waste process at a demonstration scales up to 5 ha sustainable both environmentally and economically. A Demonstration Centre of this biorefinery will be operated to demonstrate the technology, assess the operating characteristics of the system, evaluate environment impacts and collaborate with potential customers for use.
The key advantages of SABANA project are: the sustainability of the process, using marine water and recovering nutrients from wastewaters while minimizing the energy consumption, and the socioeconomic benefits, due to the relevance of the target bioproducts for two major pillars in food production as agriculture and aquaculture. Bioproducts capable of increasing the yield of crops and fish production are highly demanded, whereas recovery of nutrients is a priority issue in the EU. Instead of considering wastewater as an inevitably useless and problematic residue of our society, SABANA acknowledges its potential as an opportunity for economically relevant sectors.
SABANA project includes (i) the utilization of microalgae-bacteria consortia and in co-culture with other algae to control grazing species, (ii) the implementation of efficient thin-layer cascade and raceway, (iii) the scale-up of reactors to ensure stable operation, (iv) to use marine water to increase the sustainability of the process; (v) to recover nutrients from wastewaters, (vi) to develop harvesting processes taking into account the remaining water, (vii) to establish processes for mild/energy efficient extraction of bioproducts, (viii) to process residual biomass to produce biofertilizers and aquafeed in zero-waste schemes, (ix) using robust and sustainable technology",2016-12-01,2021-05-31,8848523.75,,['biorefinery'],1,2

These polymers strongly absorb odours from their contents, and form musty taints due to bacterial action in the waste stream, which currently needs uneconomic levels of cleaning before they can be recycled into high value products such as automotive fascias and building products.  
Of all of the post consumer polypropylene waste produced, under 1% is recycled into high quality products; the rest is used in low value applications such as buried geotextiles, or is landfilled or incinerated. The ODEX process concept from Luxus, a recycling compounder for automotive plastics, has been specifically created to provide a cost effective method to deodourise polymers for higher value uses; it uses only the existing heat energy from the compounding process to drive the odourous compounds out of carefully designed pellets within a continuous at-line process.  This project is intended to validate the feasibility of the process and formulate a business plan, to underpin our future objectives of scaling it up to commercial application.  The future embodiment of the technology is envisaged as a turnkey or retrofit option for Luxus and other existing compounders as licencees, allowing them to provide high quality polymers from materials that would otherwise have been destined for landfill or incineration.",2016-12-01,2017-05-31,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,2

Furthermore, wastewater presents itself as a constant burden for industry, particularly wastewater containing nutrients that can potentially lead to a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) which damages aquatic ecosystems. The Eggplant is an innovative two-phase water treatment procedure that filters industrial wastewater and applies a three-stage post-filtration process. Through this process, each Eggplant uses wastewater as a raw material for the production of bioplastics using a commercial bacterial culture. Critically, the water at the end of the process is purified and safe to be used as drinking water or for release into watercourses. The primary value of Eggplant is the reduction of waste from agri-food industrial wastewater from twofold to zero â€“ filtration removes the majority of pollutants and fermentation removes organic contaminants. The resulting concentrate is then processed into PHA and PHB bioplastics. Moreover, an Eggplant, through the use of concentrated substrate can generate 3-4 times as much bioplastic from an equivalent volume of wastewater.",2016-02-01,2016-05-31,50000.0,,['bioplastic'],1,2

Europe accounts for almost 50% of this market. 
Pinto, a French company with more than 40 years of experience in the field of special foundations, has developed the Green Epile project on energy piles. Energy piles are an integration of heat exchanger pipes with structural foundations. They are a double purpose structure, as they are used simultaneously to withstand the construction load and to obtain thermal heat from the underground. Our working prototype has already covered 100% of the heating/cooling needs during the test period, supplying around 22000kWh/year. With the Green Epile project we plan on one hand to reduce the current design & installation costs by 30% and on the other to increase the guaranteed exploitation period up to 25 years. Boreholes, which are currently the competitive solution in the market, require a higher initial investment and need place for the installation, while energy piles remain invisible in the foundations of the building. We will start introducing our technology in the national market because it is one of the strongest ones in Europe: it represents the 25% with â‚¬238 Million in 2008.

Spent pot lining (SPL) is a waste material generated in the Al-smelting industry and has been classified as hazardous. For
each ton of Al produced about 25 kg of SPL are generated and the Al- industry pays â‚¬520-1,560 million annually for recycling that waste with processes that do not bring much added-value. The ferrosilicon industry, whose annual production in 2013 was 8.1 million Mt is also generating an important amount of waste, mostly in the form of slag whose further treatment is both not optimized and expensive. On the other hand it appears the urgent need of minimizing the usage of cement as binding material (with the building industry as main consumer) due to the very severe environmental disadvantages: cement is the most produced and used raw material in the world with a global production
in 2015 of 4.6 billion tonnes and it is responsible for 8% of the global CO2 emissions (3 billion tons of CO2 in 2015).Gerosion, an Icelandic SME founded in 2014, is finishing the development of Alsiment, an environmentally friendly
cement-free binder able to bind SPL and other industrial waste, thus converting it into raw material valuable for energy-intensive industrial processes such as mineral wool production. With Alsiment Gerosion is supporting the metal
industry to achieve their standards of sustainability by closing the material loop (re-use of all generated waste) while also enabling industries that currently rely on cementitious binders to reduce their use of cement.. Gerosion
expects to obtain a cumulative revenue of â‚¬42 million in the period 2019-2021 achieving a 100% of the market share in Iceland and creating up to 11 new positions. This project is strategic for Gerosion as (i) it will position them

The shift is obtained by introducing three additional process steps to the standard process (rear side cleaning, passivation and laser opening), and allows a gain of typically 1% absolute in efficiency. Next generation c-Si  technologies should feature higher voltage solar cells with higher efficiency and less processing steps in the manufacturing, allowing for  further cost reduction, both at the PV panel level and for the final cost of solar electricity. AMPERE focuses on technologies with such a potential and capitalizes on the high tech investments made in Europe over the last decade for establishing advanced manufacturing processes for crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells and modules, on the development of hardware capable of coating at high speed and low cost homogeneous materials of high electronic quality. It also bases on the unique expertise gained in production of thin film modules, and in all hardware issues related to large area coatings in production environment, which can applied for the production of SHJ cells and modules. The final goal of the project is t the setting-up of a 100 MW full-scale automated pilot line in production environment at the 3Sun fab, while preparing the next steps to 300 MW and GW scale. The project will operate with the support of full technology platforms for solar cells at CEA and the platform for advanced module technologies at MBS. It will demonstrate practically the ultra-low cost potential of such manufacturing approaches, as well as the even more impressively low solar electricity generation costs thanks to high efficiency and/or intrinsic bifaciality of the selected technologies.",2017-05-01,2020-04-30,14952065.14,,['PV'],1,2

The innovation stands on using the more efficient and affordable LEDs than traditional lamps. Simulators are used for the testing of solar industry products (125billionâ‚¬ by 2023) and UV degradation (industry of plastics and coatings, 290Mâ‚¬ by 2020)
Current simulators, based in Halogen and Xenon lamps, have severe limitations and we have developed SENSEE, a solar simulator based on LEDs, to respond to the actual market needs. We have demonstrated that a LED simulator is simpler, affordable (7x times cheaper than current simulators), has 93% lower maintenance costs and more precise (only 5% of deviation to sunlight). 
The recent EU Halogen ban (Sept. 2016) and the rapid and unexpected advancement of LEDs has bring us to seize this business opportunity and bring to the market an affordable, accurate and advanced LED-BASED SUN SIMULATOR, SENSEE. SENSEE will promote a new niche of products that covers the gap between very expensive and complex systems used by accredited labs and the uncalibrated simple lamps used by small testing industry and research entities. 
SENSEE will respond to current simulators limitations that are not able to test with the required precision, the new incoming technologies (i.e. multi-junction PV cells and photocatalysis). We will introduce SENSEE in the main EU actors in PV, research centres and certification labs (Germany, Italy, France and Spain) during 2020 and 2022.

This project innovative approach is based on the application for the first time of the blockchain technology to the green certificate generation process, to create a distributed system where each transaction is encrypted and stored locally in many individual computers. Any transaction needs to be approved by a great number of members before it is exported and verify by the whole system, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries, and therefore, the fraud cases.

Green certificates are created each time one megawatt-hour of renewable energy is generated and put on the grid. Unfortunately, no matter where the electricity is generated, once the electricity enters the grid it is impossible to distinguish where it came from or how was generated. Currently this system is facing the following challenges: Lack of credibility and traceability, and fraud issues. 

With our Green Energy Tracker (GET) we are contributing to maintain a trustable renewable energy market by providing a system that Increases the credibility by substituting trust for security and traceability, eliminate fraud, increases the market efficiency and opens the possibility for new certification markets.

1234,763298,BioPackNet,Manufacturing of biodegradable and compostable packaging nets through a conventional one-step extrusion process,"European demand for plastic in 2014 was 47.8 M tonnes, of which 90% came from non-renewable sources. Moreover, 25.8 M tonnes of plastics ended up in the rubbish, with 30.8% completing their life cycle in landfills. Suitable sites for landfill across Europe are running out and public concerns are increasing about the impact of landfill on the environment and health. Reducing the quantities of waste that ultimately ends up in landfill has become imperative in the EU (Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC) and represents a particularly difficult task to achieve. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce the impact of waste and plastic production. However, some packaging items such as nets (e.g used to package potatoes, oranges) are not suitable to be treated in recycling facilities as they are difficult to be cut and get entangled in the sorting equipment ending up as waste in landfills. One possible solution is the development of biodegradable and compostable materials that could be processed through extrusion melt spinning (EMS) to manufacture these nets. Some advances have been made in this area but the high price of the final packaging product make these alternatives economically unviable. Ecoplas, a spanish manufacturer of packaging nets has come up with a solution: Biopacknet. Biopacknet will be the first packaging net with improved physical characteristics that will be processed through conventional EMS, saving energy, quantity of material and above all at a competitive cost. Biopacknet will turn into compost when it reaches its end of life, giving life to plants that will become raw materials for biopolymers in Biopacknet's formulation, closing the loop to a circular economy.

Our project, ECOMOBI, was granted the Seal of Excellence label in the last Phase 1 call with a score of 13.28; we have thus decided to resubmit it. Through ECOMOBI we plan to develop an innovative cost-effective eco-compound for the modification of bitumen. 

Bitumen has a wide range of uses, namely road construction. In order to confer it the necessary characteristics for this use, bitumen is currently modified through the use thermoplastic elastomers. However, these elastomers are expensive and confer low aging resistance, making them even less cost-effective. There is a need for bitumen modifiers that can offer the same quality properties as thermoplastic elastomers, but reducing the cost and increasing the lifespan of the end products.

On the other hand, Europe searches to promote solutions for the recycling of tyres. Across Europe, 5.7M tonnes of tyres are stockpiled in landfills, and recently the biggest tyre dump in Europe caught fire, with the subsequent damage to the environment and human health. However, currently only 17% of Europe's end of life tyres are recycled. 

ECOMOBI brings forward the development of a solution for bitumen modification using end of life tyres: RD PRENE. Through the commercialization of RD PRENE, Tecnofilm would have an annual revenue of 10M â‚¬ in 2022. Its innovative formulation and extrusion process have managed to match the quality of thermoplastic elastomers. The increased elasticity of the bitumen modified with RD PRENE confers a 50% longer lifespan to end products than current alternatives, reducing the maintenance and replacement needs and derived costs. Moreover, due to the use of tyre powder in its composition, RD PRENE is 57-26% less expensive than current alternatives and can lead an average  bitumen production site to save 15% annually.

To ensure stability of the grid, it is critical to develop provably safe feedback control algorithms that take into account uncertainties in the output of weather-based renewable generation and in participation of distributed producers and consumers in electricity markets. The focus of this proposal is to develop the theory and algorithms for control of large-scale stochastic hybrid systems in order to guarantee safe and efficient grid operations. Stochastic hybrid systems are a powerful modeling framework. They capture uncertainties in the output of weather-based renewable generation as well as complex hybrid state interactions arising from discrete-valued network topologies with continuous-valued voltages and frequencies. The problems of stability and efficiency of the grid in the face of its changes will be formulated as safety and optimal control problems for stochastic hybrid systems. Using recent advances in numerical optimization and statistics, provably safe and scalable numerical algorithms for control of this class of systems will be developed. These algorithms will be implemented and validated on realistic power grid simulation platforms  and will take advantage of recent advances in sensing, control and communication technologies for the grid. The end outcome of the project is better quantifying and controlling effects of increased uncertainties on the stability of the grid. The societal and economic implications of this study are tied with the value and price of a secure power grid.

As the regionâ€™s largest country, Polandâ€™s continuing economic progress has not come without significant costs; due to its history in electricity production, in 2009 it had the highest rate of production by coal of any EU member state. This makes Poland Europeâ€™s third largest polluter in terms of damage to society, home to six of Europeâ€™s 30 most damaging power-plants, and to be among Europeâ€™s worst for public exposure to harmful pollution.  At the same time it is experiencing rises in domestic electricity demand twice the EU average. This makes Poland the most urgent nation in the EU with regards to the need for immediate conversion to renewable energy systems and resources.  However, unlike traditional power facilities, energy produced by RES often produces unpredictable and variable outputs related to weather, season, and geographical location.  While Polish research now has expertise in many of the technologies needed for energy transition, it lacks critical knowledge in modelling, planning, integrating, and managing large-scale renewable energy systems in a flexible and effective manner.

1238,761036,MMAMA,Microwave Microscopy for Advanced and Efficient Materials Analysis and Production,"Products which require complicated material systems and nanoscale structural organization, e.g. third-generation solar cells, are often difficult to develop. This is because electronic properties of bulk semiconductors are often masked or at least strongly superimposed by material interface properties. Additionally these interface properties are also complex and thus make product design difficult.

This project aims at solving this problem by offering a nanoscale characterization platform for the European manufacturers of coatings, photovoltaic cells, and semi-conductor circuits. It is proposed to use a combination of scanning microwave microscopes, dielectric resonators, and simulation to measure the material and interface properties of complicated material systems and nano-structures. A metrological system of cross-checks between different instruments, models and simulations with associated error bars is indispensable for obtaining trustworthy results.

Scanning microwave measurements will be directly used for three-dimensional characterization of electrical properties of nanostructured semiconductors used in organic and hybrid photovoltaic cells. The objective is to accelerate the development of high efficiency cells and to have measures to predict performances in early stages of prototype production. Where process monitoring of materials with nanostructures is necessary, a dielectric resonator is used to translate insights from scanning microwave microscope measurements to fabrication environments. Such dielectric resonators could be directly integrated in production lines for monitoring thin film deposition processes.

An open innovation environment will make the uptake of the results easier for European industry. A database containing exemplary measurement datasets of scanning microwave microscopes will be available in calibrated and raw versions.

These keys work with encryption algorithms and are crucial to ensuring data security. However, most commonly used RNGs do not generate truly random numbers, so encrypted data and communications are increasingly vulnerable to hackers. The most secure solution for ciphers is the use of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs). These use quantum physics principles for true randomness.
There are a number of barriers for QRNGs to be used in the market. Some existing QRNGs are too slow (i.e. only Mbps), some are not high-quality and all of them are too expensive. Also, QRNGs are 100mm2 or more, too large for many applications.
Quside will overcome these barriers with a QRNG chip called Qupic. It uses standard components and manufacturing procedures. It is high-quality and lightning-fast (up to tens of Gbps). The Qupic chip is so small that it can fit inside of a smartphone and so fast that it satisfies the needs of a data centre. Our manufacturing processes allow us to build this technology not just faster and smaller than our competitors, but also orders of magnitude cheaper. 
The result will be a permanently secure infrastructure for data and communications.
The QRNG market size will approach $1 billion by 2020. Apart from security in servers, the cloud and connected devices, QRNGs are also used for complex simulations in scientific, financial and engineering applications. Our initial target markets will be: data centre security, random numbers as a service, IoT devices, large-scale numerical simulations and smartphones/laptops/tablets.

This accumulation of data are elaborated and redirected within data centers with a continuous growing of traffic congestion. The continuous growth of traffic require therefore a roadmap of bandwidth density growth that necessarily has to be scalable on the timeframe of several years.

1246,694078,SOLCRIMET,Solvometallurgy for critical metals,"The recent â€œrare-earth crisisâ€ has brought about the widespread realisation that the long-term availability and cost stability of many materials â€“ not just the rare earths â€“ can no longer be guaranteed. Increasing the levels of critical metal recycling from pre-consumer, manufacturing waste and complex, multicomponent end-of-life consumer products is considered as arguably the most important and realistic mitigation strategy. However, extracting a critical metal from complex waste is a very different challenge to that faced when attempting to produce a pure metal from a primary ore deposit. SOLCRIMET therefore develops a ground-breaking, novel approach called â€œsolvometallurgyâ€, a new branch within metallurgy, next to conventional hydro- and pyrometallurgy. SOLCRIMETâ€™s aim is to successfully apply this approach to the extraction of specific critical metals, i.e. rare earths, tantalum, niobium, cobalt, indium, gallium, germanium and antimony. As these critical metals are essential components for clean-tech and high-tech applications, they are key enablers of the required transition to a low-carbon, circular economy. The approach involves the discovery of non-aqueous solvent pairs that are immiscible and allow the extraction of metal complexes at moderate temperatures, leading to high-purity recycled metals. The idea is certainly high risk, but the preliminary results already obtained are highly encouraging. The main outcomes of the project will be lab-scale demonstrators that show the enhanced efficiency, utility and applicability of the new solvometallurgical process, with respect to conventional hydro- and pyrometallurgy. SOLCRIMETâ€™s impact on chemistry, chemical technology, metallurgy and materials engineering science will be game-changing. The possibility to recycle critical metals with energy-efficient, low-cost processes could have a significant impact on the global recycling rates of these metals.",2016-09-01,2021-08-31,2496250.0,,['recycling'],1,2
1247,708984,BuildingControls,Efficient Grid Connected Buildings: A Distributed Control Framework for Managing Flexible Loads,"The renewable energy penetration targets set by EU  and US  necessitate a radical change in the way we operate the electric power grid. Conventional power grid was designed around dispatchable central power plants at a transmission level providing services down to industrial, commercial and residential end-users at a distribution level. Increased penetration of the intermittent and uncertain renewable energy sources effectively implies additional load and generation flexibility is required at multiple time-scales to ensure safe and stable operation of the electric grid. Since conventional generation is increasingly displaced by renewables, this additional flexibility can no longer be sourced solely from conventional plants. 

According to the International Energy Agency, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the global energy consumption, and about 50% of the energy used in a building is accounted for by the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Thus, improving operational efficiency of HVAC systems will results in large savings in the energy consumption. Moreover, buildings present a unique opportunity as flexible loads that can be controlled to provide ancillary services to the electric power grid, and thus enable high penetration of renewables.  High thermal capacity of large commercial buildings allow real-time control of their HVAC systems to regulate electricity demand as required for grid stability, without effecting the quality of service in the building significantly.

In this project, our objective is to develop (1) novel scalable optimal control algorithms that reduce building peak load and energy consumption, (2) a distributed control framework for coordinating multiple buildings as flexible energy resources for ancillary services, and (3) tools for assessing the performance of this framework from economic, environmental and sustainability perspectives.",2016-06-01,2018-05-31,157845.6,,['renewable energy'],1,2
1248,704476,FPGA Accelerators,Energy Efficient FPGA Accelerators for Graph Analytics Applications,"It is reported that data centers today consume up to 3 percent of the global electricity usage. This is expected to increase in the upcoming years as the amount of data processed in the cloud increases substantially. An effective way for data centers to achieve better performance and energy efficiency is to perform computation on specialized processing elements. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enable customization of logic after manufacturing to achieve better energy efficiency compared to general purpose processors. Today, prominent hardware and software companies are investing in data center solutions that integrate FPGAs with CPUs, and significant energy consumption and performance improvements have been demonstrated for several data center applications. However, the main barrier for wide spread adoption of FGPAs in data centers is the cost of programming, which typically requires months of development time by hardware designers. This makes it unaffordable for small-to-medium software companies to effectively utilize the available FPGAs. The purpose of this project is to lower this barrier for emerging graph analytics applications for knowledge discovery and machine learning. The basic idea is to use an abstract interface that allows a domain expert to describe an application as a set of serial functions defined per vertex and/or edge. We propose a customizable implementation template that automatically maps the abstract user functions to massively parallel FPGA implementations. The proposed template will hide from users many low level implementation details such as parallelization, pipelining, synchronization, memory access optimization, race and deadlock avoidance, etc. This will help bridge the gap between high level application descriptions and costly hardware implementations. Our preliminary architecture simulations have shown that the proposed graph processors can achieve significantly better energy efficiency than general purpose processors.",2016-04-01,2018-03-31,145845.6,,['data center'],1,2
1249,656132,SolHyPro,Water splitting by solar energy: From lab-scale to prototype devices,"Hematite is a promising photoanode material for harvesting solar energy by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. It has a favorable bandgap energy (2.1 eV), good catalytic activity for water oxidation, low cost, is chemically stable in alkaline solutions and environmentally friendly. However, its water splitting efficiency is limited by electron-hole recombination length and it produces a below threshold photovoltage. The key to increasing the recombination length is supressing defects such as grain boundaries or surface roughness of the photoanode. The second issue is successfully resolved by coupling the photoelectrolytic cell to a photovoltaic cell, a so-called tandem cell with theoretically higher efficiency owing to optimal use of the solar spectrum. Both of these drawbacks are accounted for in this project.
The aim of this project is to optimize the water photoelectrolysis performance of the photoelectrolysis-photovoltaic tandem-cell device by tailoring the microstructure of the thin film hematite photoanods, and up scaling from the laboratory scale to a prototype device. Fabrication of an efficient water-splitting cell is challenging as it consists of several thin film layers. Each of these layers impacts on the performance of the water-splitting tandem-cell.
Up scaling from the lab scale to the prototype scale (10x10cm2) will be carried out in cooperation with PVComB in Germany. This poses entirely different challenges, creating the need for an adapted fabrication sequence and deposition conditions that ensure the adhesion of the ceramic and metal thin film layers. At the end of this project, I personally will have gained expertise in advanced microstructural analysis technique and also in the leadership role, which will enable me to take the next step in my carrier. And, we will have built a fully functional, fabrication-ready device for hydrogen production directly from solar energy.

1250,656822,ChloroQuality,Dissecting chloroplast protein quality control specificity for rational plant reprogramming,"Improving food quality, crop productivity and plant resistance to stresses are major demands of Europeâ€™s society and economy. Plants are sessile organisms that have developed very flexible strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions as heat, cold, drought and salt stress. These stresses cause protein misfolding and aggregation resulting in plant damage/death and productivity losses. Recycling of damaged proteins is achieved by the action of molecular chaperones. But when recycling is not possible, toxic aggregated proteins have to be degraded by the action of proteases to avoid cellular damage. Chaperones and proteases act coordinately and constitute the protein quality control system that is essential for plant survival. In plant chloroplasts, the chaperone Hsp70 is known to posttranslationally regulate important processes like photosynthesis. It is known that the specificity of Hsp70 is determined by its J-protein partners, adaptors that recognize unfolded substrates and transfer them to the chaperone for refolding. However, little is known about the target proteins of Hsp70, such that there is a large lack of information about how chloroplastic enzymes are regulated at protein levels. This knowledge is crucial for rational engineering of specific molecular pathways and plant fitness improvement. The ability to specifically alter plant metabolism without undesirable effects is a fundamental demand of European society and addresses current concerns about transgenic plants. This proposal aims to cover this gap by discovering and validating interactors of chloroplastic J-proteins. The strong background of the applicant in protein quality control and the expertise in chloroplast biology of the receiving group will synergistically contribute to shed light on the chloroplast signaling network. In addition, this project aims to develop the candidate into an independent scientist and open his own line of investigation.",2016-01-01,2017-12-31,159460.8,,['recycling'],1,2
1251,731761,IMAGINE,Robots Understanding Their Actions by Imagining Their Effects,"'Today's robots are good at executing programmed motions, but they do not understand their actions in the sense that they could automatically generalize them to novel situations or recover from failures.  IMAGINE seeks to enable robots to understand the structure of their environment and how it is affected by its actions.  'Understanding' here means the ability of the robot (a) to determine the applicability of an action along with parameters to achieve the desired effect, and (b) to discern to what extent an action succeeded, and to infer possible causes of failure and generate recovery actions.

The core functional element is a generative model based on an association engine and a physics simulator.  'Understanding' is given by the robot's ability to predict the effects of its actions, before and during their execution.  This allows the robot to choose actions and parameters based on their simulated performance, and to monitor their progress by comparing observed to simulated behavior.

This scientific objective is pursued in the context of recycling of electromechanical appliances.  Current recycling practices do not automate disassembly, which exposes humans to hazardous materials, encourages illegal disposal, and creates significant threats to environment and health, often in third countries.  IMAGINE will develop a TRL-5 prototype that can autonomously disassemble prototypical classes of devices, generate and execute disassembly actions for unseen instances of similar devices, and recover from certain failures.  For robotic disassembly, IMAGINE will develop a multi-functional gripper capable of multiple types of manipulation without tool changes.

IMAGINE raises the ability level of robotic systems in core areas of the work programme, including adaptability, manipulation, perception, decisional autonomy, and cognitive ability.  Since only one-third of EU e-waste is currently recovered, IMAGINE addresses an area of high economical and ecological impact.

This projectÂ´s goal is advanced materials and nanotechnologies for novel CIGS PV device architectures with efficiencies â‰¥ 23.0 %, thus beyond that of the current state-of-the-art technologies. The technology targets the BIPV sector and enables several innovative solutions for BIPV.
The novel functional materials and material combinations are (1) surface functionalized steel substrates, (2) nano-structuring strategies for optical management of rear contact layers, (3) passivation layers with nano-sized point openings, and (4) ultra-thin CIGS thin film absorber layers. The concepts will be developed and established in production viable equipment. Additionally, this new design will also increase the systemâ€™s lifetime and materials resource efficiency, mainly due to the use of ultra-thin CIGS layers (less In and Ga), and barrier and passivation layers that hinder alkali metal movement. Hence, this project will lead to enhanced performance, but also yield and stability, while maintaining manufacturability. The consortium includes SMEâ€™s and industrial partners positioned throughout the complete solar module manufacturing value chain. Their roles will be to develop and commercialize new equipment, products and/or services. The consortium already pioneered the proposed advanced material solutions up to technology readiness level (TRL) 4, and this project targets to bring these innovative concepts to TRL 6 in a low-cost demonstrator. The aim is to develop and validate innovative, economic and sustainable BIPV applications, as a near future high value market for the European PV industries.

The targeted secondary raw materials will be autocatalysts, electronic waste (WEEE) and tailings and slags from nickel and copper smelters, opening-up an important range of alternative sources of these critical raw materials, with the potential to substitute a large amount of primary raw materials which are becoming more and more scarce in Europe. 

For the first time five of the major research centres in Europe will collaborate in developing and fine tuning the most advanced recovery processes for PGMs. This joint effort will lead to a unique exchange of know-how and best practices between researchers all over Europe, aiming at the selection of the recycling process and the preparation of the Blueprint Process Design that will set the basis for a new PGM supply chain in the EU. 
Two primary and secondary material producers with a consolidated business model  will carry out validation of the innovative recovery processes in an industrially relevant environment by installing and testing them in an industrially relevant environment and benchmarking with the currently adopted recovery processes. A recycling company will provide a link to market introduction by manufacturing autocatalysts with second-life PGMs obtained via the PLATIRUS technology.

Recent studies  on the characterization of C&DW samples at European level revealed a predominant fraction of concrete (52% average). Over the last years, novel technology has been developed aiming to guarantee high quality recycled concrete aggregates for use in new concrete, thereby closing the concrete loop. The most advanced concrete recycling technologies currently produce coarse (>4mm) recycled concrete aggregates by removing cement paste from the surface of the aggregates. However, the fine (0-4 mm) fraction, ca. 40% of the concrete waste, still faces technical barriers to be incorporated into new concrete and consequently, is often down-cycled. At the other extreme, there are minor (e.g. glass) and emerging (e.g. mineral wool) C&DW materials, currently accounting for 0.7% of the total, but revealing growing rates as consequence of European regulations. Those emerging C&DW streams have not yet found technological and business solutions, being mostly landfilled. On the other hand, concrete is the most widely used material in building, with a growing trend towards prefabrication. The European precast concrete sector faces diverse needs for resource efficiency improvement (reduction in natural resource consumption and metabolization of waste materials, reduction in carbon footprint and embodied energy, design for reuse, increase in process efficiency and waste minimization, lighter solutions, enhanced thermal performance through novel cost-effective insulating materials). Aiming at facing these challenges, VEEP main objective is to eco-design, develop and demonstrate new cost-effective technological solutions that will lead to novel closed-loop circular approaches for C&DW recycling into novel multilayer precast concrete elements (for both new buildings and refurbishment) incorporating new concretes as well as superinsulation material produced by using at least 75% (by weight) of C&DW recycled materials.",2016-10-01,2020-09-30,4929753.75,,['recycling'],1,2

Even though there are several prototypes of different scales that have been tested on the last years (mostly under controlled conditions) there is limited data on deployments in real conditions which negatively affects the accurate formulation of constrained problems on array schemes resulting on incomplete layout optimisation models. This project aims to provide a significant contribution towards the understanding of (a) the effects of TECs interactions with the environment; (b) the capabilities and limitations of common strategies used for the numerical modelling of TECs; and (c) how to mathematically formulate optimisation models to solve the TEC array layout problem considering technical, socio-economic and environmental constraints. From the methodology point of view, constraint optimisation models will be mathematically formulated considering ocean energy protocols, data collected from in-field measurements of prototypes tested in real environments and with surrogates built from validated numerical simulations.

C-tokens are thin and flexible, metal-oxide tags, integrated in paper and plastic products. The tags will send a dynamic capacitive signal into the reading devices.
C-tokens make it possible to identify and locate low cost and high volume products, like cards or labels, to the internet, just by putting them on a touchscreen. The number of different IDâ€™s is very high and make it possible to create unique codes per product. The very small footprint (much smaller than NFC or QR) and low thickness make it possible to integrate them in a product as thin and flexible as a playing card. They are more secure than QR (can be copied) or NFC (can be read from distance) and they can detect the exact position of an object (important for board game applications).
The tags will harvest the necessary energy from the capacitive screen, trough capacitive coupling or photovoltaic technology. The high end c-token can communicate with the touchscreens bi-directionally, making use of photo sensors inside the cards.

It will study and develop innovative device concepts for integrated photoelectrochemical devices that will go far beyond the current state of the art and will allow to reduce Ohmic transport losses in the electrolyte and membranes. The best concepts will be scaled up to prototype size (>100 cmÂ²) and will be subject to extensive stability optimization. Especially, the use of innovative ALD based metal oxide sealing layers will be studied. The devices will have the great advantage compared to decoupled systems that they will have reduced Ohmic transport losses. Another advantage for application in sunny, hot regions will be that these devices have a positive temperature coefficient, because the improvements of the electrochemical processes overcompensate the reduced PV conversion efficiency. With these results, an in-depth socio-techno-economic model will be developed to predict the levelized cost of hydrogen production, which will be below 5â‚¬/Kg Hydrogen in locations with high solar irradiation, as preliminary back of the envelope calculations have revealed. Based on these findings, the most promising technologies will be scaled to module size. The final system will consist of several planar modules and will be placed in JÃ¼lich.

The advent of graphene, and the ability to fabricate single atom thick membranes, promises further device downscaling, enabling ultimate sensing capabilities that until recently seemed utopical. But, these atomically thin membranes are in essence nonlinear and exhibit nonlinear dynamic behavior at forces of only a few pN, which needs to be understood to harness their full potential.
Although the field of nonlinear dynamics dates back several centuries, its implications at the atomic scale have remained relatively unexplored. Thermal fluctuations due to Brownian motion and nanoscale forces become dominant at this scale, and when combined with grapheneâ€™s exotic elasticity, give rise to phenomena that are not observed before, and cannot be explained by classical approaches. Our poor understanding of these complex features at the same time, have made characterization of graphene very challenging. An example is its bending modulus that is evaluated orders of magnitude higher than theoretical predications, by the available experimental methods.
In this project, I aim at providing full understanding of nonlinearities of these one atom thick membranes, not only to unveil the enigmatic behavior of graphene but also to improve current nanomaterial characterization methods. The distinguishing feature of my methodology is that on the one side, it will be based on atomistic simulations combined with modal order reduction techniques, to predict the complexities at the single atom level; on the other side, experimental nonlinear dynamic data will be analyzed for evaluating nonlinear effects and extracting material properties using nonlinear resonances in the MHz range.

While studies addressing the ecological implications of hydropower have mostly focused on large facilities, investigations on small hydropower (SHP) are scarcer. Yet, development of SHP is booming globally and in the Alps rising concerns about cumulative effects on riverine systems.
This project proposes a multi-disciplinary investigation to better quantify hydrological alterations from SHP and its effects on Alpine stream ecosystems. Combining field-experiments, surveys and innovative modelling of existing flow data-series, the project will: i) quantify the spatio-temporal scales of hydrologic alterations associated with SHP using integrated analytical tools and modelling approaches applied to long-term, spatially distributed data; ii) experimentally mimic water abstractions from SHP using semi-natural flumes to assess the response of aquatic invertebrates and the link between community assembly and ecosystem function applying the Price Equation partition; iii) quantify flow-ecology relationships and the cumulative effects of multiple SHPs using novel functional regression models with streams hydrographs. The results will provide new insights into the short- and long-term effects of SHP on Alpine streams, with practical implication for the sustainable use of water resources.
During the project, I will train intensively in methods and software to quantify and model alterations of river flow and habitat and in handling large datasets.

The project addresses market uptake challenges for a wider use of district heating and cooling systems (DHC) with high shares of RES, specifically the action focuses on the use of large-scale solar thermal plants combined with other RES in DHC systems.
The key approach of the project is to develop, improve and implement in 9 participating EU regions advanced policies and support measures for SDH. In 3 focus regions Thuringia (DE), Styria (AT) and Rhone-Alpes (FR) the regulating regional authorities are participating as project partners to ensure a strong implementation capacity within the project. In 6 follower regions from BG, DE, IT, PL, SE the regulating authorities are engaged through letters of commitment. The project activities aim at a direct mobilization of investments in SDH and hence a significant market rollout.
The project work program in the participating regions follows a process including 1) strategy and action planning based on a survey, best practices and stakeholder consultation 2) an implementation phase starting at an early project stage and 3) efficient dissemination of the project results at national and international level.
Adressed market uptake challenges are: Improved RES DHC policy, better access to plant financing and business models, sustained public acceptance and bridging the gap between policy and market through market support and capacity building. Denmark and Sweden reached already today a high share of RES in DHC and shall be used as a role model for this project.
The direct expected outcome and impact of SDHp2m is estimated to an installed or planned new RES DHC capacity and new SDH capacity directly triggered by the project until project end corresponding to a total investment of 350 Mio. â‚¬ and leading to 1 420 GWh RES heat and cold production per year.

1270,723509,MoNIfly,Mobile-Network Infrastructure for Cooperative Surveillance of low flying drones,"The number of drones in commercial and recreational use is expected to grow significantly within the next years. Currently the most dynamic market is in low flying remotely piloted and autonomous aerial vehicles. In 2016 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published three different categories of such drones: an open category, a specific category and a certified category. The MoNIfly project (Mobile-Network Infrastructure for Cooperative Surveillance of Low Flying Drones) targets the open and specific categories by proposing a drone traffic management system based on mobile network infrastructure. The main challenge will be the acceptance of low flying devices by the general public. Therefore innovative solutions must be found, developed and demonstrated to allow safe and society friendly as well as aviation-harmonized drone operations. The MoNIfly concept will enable applications with virtual barriers (so-called geo fence applications) that use static databases as well as high-dynamic update rates to support moving vehicles. This means that the risk of collisions of drones with static obstacles but also other drones or aircraft/helicopters will be greatly reduced. Additionally this concept will allow protection of privacy sensitive areas like private houses/gardens or even scenes of an accident or incident. Another area of operation could be the TV market where during sports events the target of interest (e.g. downhill skier or car racer) would be protected by a fast moving geo-fenced area. The MoNIfly consortium consists of a Mobile Infrastructure provider (Nokia), a drone manufacturer (Aerial Tronics Group), a drone operator (UAV International) and two universities (Royal Military Academy Brussels and TU Braunschweig) with excellent background in current air traffic management and drone operations. The project aims to develop the applications described above and will demonstrate their feasibility in a relevant environment. The goal is to enhance the technology readiness level (TRL) from 2 (technology concept formulated) to a TRL of 4 (technology validated in lab) or 5 (technology validated in relevant environment).",2017-06-01,2020-05-31,2021250.0,,['traffic management'],1,2

This industry is a strategic sector in the EU economy, actively contributing to the re-industrialisation of Europe. Currently, the production of paper and board in the EU is 91 tonnes per year, while PfR represents 63%. The contribution of PfR has increased over the last few years (from 25 t to 40 t).
This increase in the availability of PfR has not taken place in all EU states, and this is especially true in Eastern European countries. Besides, although high collection rates are achieved, the quality of this material does not always meet the requirements of paper recycling. Both facts make difficult to keep up with the increases in PfR collection rates observed over the last few years if specific actions are not taken.
IMPACTPapeRec aims to put Europe at the forefront of PfR collection, ensuring raw material procurement from mainly European sources through an innovative approach based on the participation of the whole paper value chain including citizens and municipalities, which is also open to other sectors. Main objective is to provide an innovative and common knowledge platform, which will enable present and future cooperation. Analysis on best practices in PfR collection and assessment procedures are delivered, considering specific local conditions. They will encourage reliable decisions and make solutions available to decision-makers ensuring the procurement and supply of PfR in Europe through the improvement of municipal paper collection. Medium-long results are: increases in PfR collection (up to 75%); 1.57 Mt/year and raw material savings of â‚¬385 million.

The project motivation lies on the fact that magnesium alloys can offer a significant weight reduction when compared to aluminium alloys. weight reduction is a cross sectorial key design driver, if a superior energy absorption and vibratory behaviour is added, magnesium is promising candidate for future application if some of its drawbacks are overcome, such as its cost, manufacturability problems, corrosion and creep behaviour and low allowable service temperature. Addition of Rare Earth Elements (REE) improves the performance of Mg alloys significantly, though a price increase has to be taken into account. REMAGHIC believes that by investing in recovery and recycling technologies, a new alloying process can be developed to yield low cost Mg\REE alloys. In order to do this, REE that are usually stockpiled (Ce, La) in favour of the most demanded ones (Nd, Dy) will be considered as attractive candidates to lower the price. This list of REE will be completed by other promising candidates found in the literature (Y, Gd, Sa). The project will contribute to reducing the dependency of the supply of critical elements (REE and Mg) on sources exterior to the EU and to solving the REE Balance Problem. 

REMAGHIC will contribute to the penetration of magnesium alloys in important sectors for the European industry (Transport, Energy, Biomedicine); it will foster the work done by Tier1s, and promote the interest of different OEMs on future generations of light structural components of competitive performance (that of primary Mg\REE alloys), low cost (that of primary Mg) and weight reduction (30%).",2015-09-01,2018-08-31,3253441.0,,['recycling'],1,2

Especially electronic equipment contains precious metals and a series of strategic raw materials. 
To date the material specific recycling is focused on mass stream concepts such as shredder processes and metallurgy to extract the high-value metallic constituents, i.e. copper, gold, silver. However, a series of critical elements cannot be recovered efficiently or is even lost in dust or residual fractions. 

The goal of ADIR is to demonstrate the feasibility of a key technology for next generation urban mining. An automated disassembly of electronic equipment will be worked out to separate and recover valuable materials. The concept is based on image processing, robotic handling, pulsed power technology, 3D laser measurement, real-time laser material identification (to detect materials), laser processing (to access components, to selectively unsolder these; to cut off parts of a printed circuit board),  and automatic separation into different sorting fractions. A machine concept will be worked out being capable to selectively disassemble printed circuit boards and mobile phones with short cycle times to gain sorting fractions containing high amounts of valuable materials. Examples are those materials with high economic importance and significant supply risk such as tantalum, rare earth elements, germanium, cobalt, palladium, gallium and tungsten.

A demonstrator will be developed and evaluated in field tests at a recycling company. The obtained sorting fractions will be studied with respect to their further processing and recovery potential for raw materials. Refining companies will define requirements and test the processing of sorting fractions with specific material enrichments.

The test site is an existing dry well in Larderello, Italy, already drilled to a depth of 2.2 km and temperature of 350 Â°C, which will be further drilled to 3-3.5 km to reach super-critical conditions unexpectedly experienced, and not controlled, in a nearby well in 1979. 
The project will be organized into two main phases: (1) Drilling in super-critical conditions, including drilling components, well materials, design and control; (2) Geo-Scientific activities for predicting and controlling critical conditions, which considers petrological, physical and chemical characterization, simulation and monitoring, including high temperature and pressure tools.
Main expected outcomes:
â€¢ Improved drilling concepts in deep crustal conditions
â€¢ New drilling materials, equipment and tools
â€¢ Physical and chemical characterization of deep crustal fluids and rocks
The site is perfect for such an experiment, as it is representative of most deep crustal levels in Europe, cost effective since drilling to reach the target is reduced to a minimum, practical due to the high probability of encountering super-critical conditions. The productivity and efficiency of the project are guaranteed by the combination of industrial and research participation and by the recognised expertise of the consortium in geothermal R&D as well as oil and gas drilling, bringing together excellence in the respective sectors.

However, this convenience contributes in a significant way to environmental pollution, as packaging is mainly achieved by plastic materials in this case. Biodegradable packaging materials have been on the market for many decades. However, there are severe restrictions preventing their broad application in food packaging, as these materials do not provide the requested properties, such as a sufficient barrier against water vapour, oxygen or flavours. 
Our idea is to improve these properties by a biodegradable coating. We have developed high-barrier coatings based on a class of materials with glass-like structural units, so called ORMOCERÂ®s. However, these coatings are not biobased, nor biodegradable.
The target of the planned project is the development of new functional hybrid (inorganic-organic) coatings for applications in food, cosmetic & medical device packaging. These new coatings will be based on the work of Fraunhofer ISC who has patented and licensed ORMOCERÂ® lacquers used for coating applications in order to increase barrier properties of packaging films. 
The aim of the planned project is to synthesise new coating materials based on bioORMOCERÂ®s, which are formed of functionalised biopolymers extracted from lignocellulosic biomass sources using the bioORMOCERÂ® synthesis approach. In particular, the polymeric structures of hemicelluloses and polyesters will be exploited. By the use of these biopolymer, the organoalkoxysilanes which are components of the state-of-the art ORMOCERÂ® lacquers will be substituted to obtain a purely biobased functional coating material.

The following solutions are proposed:
- Harmonized procedures complemented with an intelligent tool and a supply chain tracking system, for highly-efficient sorting at source in demolition and refurbishment works.
- Advanced sorting and recycling technologies for the production and automated quality assessment of high-purity raw materials from complex C&DW.
- Development of optimized building products (low embodied energy cements, green concretes, bricks, plasterboards and gypsum plasters, extruded composites) through the partial replacement of virgin raw materials by higher amounts of secondary high-purity raw materials recovered from complex C&DW.
These solutions will be demonstrated in demolition projects and 5 case studies across Europe.

In order to increase the value of its side streams, PULP2VALUE developed multiple extraction techniques to isolate more valuable products from this large fraction of sugar beet pulp. Roughly 65% of the dry matter mass can be isolated as high value products being: microcellulose fibers (MCF) (33%), arabinose (16%) and galacturonic acid (16%).

The overall objective of this project is to  further establish the value chains based on MCF, arabinose (Ara) and galacturonic acid (GalA). By demonstrating an integrated and cost-effective cascading biorefinery system to refine sugar beet pulp, Cosun aims to significantly increase (20-50 times) the value of the sugar beet pulp by demonstrating applications for approximately 65% of its mass in high value markets. 

For each of these products PULP2VALUE identified multiple product market combinations (PMCâ€™s). For the MCF fraction application supply chains towards detergents, personal care, oil & gas, paints & coatings and composites are developed. Throughout the years Cosun developed a pilot facility in which the state-of-the-art unit of operations were tested. Together with partners, Cosun is now planning to optimize, integrate and scale-up these processes to a demonstration scale to further supply product development in order to establish long lasting supply chains. 

The PULP2VALUE will target 9 new value chains resulting in a market potential of at least 350.000 tons and a potential revenue of 200 million euro.

1287,827876,LONGRIDER,Long Autonomy E-bike through enhanced Regenerative Braking,"The e-bike industry is a blooming market since it provides a solid alternative for cleaner, more sustainable urban mobility. Annual e-bike sales are in the order of 3,400 Mâ‚¬ in Europe only and are expected to rise up to 7, 200 Mâ‚¬ by 2025. However, there is still an unsolved and recurrent complaint related to the limited autonomy of e-bikes. 
LONGRIDER is a novel control system for e-bikes that provides extended battery autonomy by supporting the cyclist only when necessary and by applying extensive and efficient regenerative braking. By cleverly controlling the energy use (deliver and recover), the feeling for the cyclist is that of continuously riding on flat terrain irrespective of the terrain slope, and in the limit case it is even possible to make the battery last close-to-indefinitely (provided that the user is willing to compensate the system inefficiencies by pedaling). Thus, the value proposition of the LONGRIDER e-bike can be formulated in 2 ways:
-An e-bike with the same battery size as competitors that can last significantly more (up to 200% more with mild regenerative braking, and above that with a more intensive regeneration set-up)
-An e-bike with a smaller battery size than competitors for the same autonomy (LONGRIDER requires a battery-pack 60-70% smaller with the associated cost and weight reduction)
The development of this new concept is being carried out by a team that has extensive experience in the electric mobility industry developing next generation motors for electric vehicles, as well as a solid background in bicycles with over 10 patents related to innovative concepts for bicycles, some of them under licensing discussions with major brands in the bicycle industry (Sram, Campagnolo and FSA).

The project is deeply rooted in pevious national and European projects, in which the consortium members were actively involved. The underlying principle is that Nutrient Use Efficency can be significantly improved by integrating on-farm techniques and systems that allow better reconnection between 1) animal husbandry provided flows and 2) plant production requirements. At the same time this reconnection itself will serve a better C-return to soil and GHG-reduction by avoided emissions optionally combined with energy production for self-consumption on-farm.

NUTRI2CYCLE aims to (i) benchmark mass flows of nutrients, organic carbon and GHG-footprint, (ii) provide an assessment frame (toolbox) for evaluating potential impact of proposed innovations, (iii) actively support concepts, techniques and scenarios put forward in EIP-Operational Groups, (iv) optimize these (\ in-consortium developed) scenarios using the toolbox, (v) showcase the most promising developments via prototypes and demos. Finally, using the experience gained at a local/regional scale, NUTRI2CYCLE will elaborate strategic scenarios to identify the effect of these innovations at European scale. 

NUTRI2CYCLE brings together the extensive expertise of leading experts in the field of nutrient cycling. This collaboration originates from the EIP-Focus Group on Nutrient Recycling, closely interacting with the EIP Operational Groups in the individual EU member states. Better nutrient stewardship engaging all actors across the value chain as envisaged in NUTRI2CYCLE will increase the C, N and P recycling rate significantly and will improve the overall sustainability and innovation capacity of European agricultural systems.",2018-10-01,2022-09-30,6850050.5,,['recycling'],1,2

1292,745785,URBIOFIN,Demonstration of an integrated innovative biorefinery for the transformation of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into new BioBased products (URBIOFIN),"Due to the rapid growth of population, municipal solid waste (MSW) has contributed significantly to the total amount of waste generated by our society. Today in Europe, each habitant generates, in average, 0.5 tonnes of MSW per year, increasing at an annual rate of 10%. Around 40-50% of it correspond to organic waste. This organic fraction mainly contains carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, which are all useful raw material that can be converted to valuable products. Its valorisation will help to solve environmental pollution but also contributes to the transition from a linear to a renewable circular economy. Digestion and composting have contributed to the reduction of the biodegradable fraction of MSW sent to landfill. The low economical value of compost and biogas is limiting the sustainable implementation of separate sourcing systems since increasing citizen environmental (waste) taxes is then need to tackle important logistic costs. New biobased products can help to improve waste treatment environmental and socio-economical sustainability. The aim of URBIOFIN project is to demonstrate the techno-economic and environmental viability of the conversion at semi-industrial scale (10 T/d) of the organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW) into: Chemical building blocks (bioethanol, volatile fatty acids, biogas), biopolymers (polyhydroyalkanoate and biocomposites) or additives (microalgae hydrolisated for biofertilisers). By using the biorefinery concept applied to MSW (urban biorefinery), URBIOFIN will exploit the OFMSW as feedstock to produce different valuable marketable products for different markets: agriculture, cosmetics.

1293,750104,RESOURCE,Groundwater quality assessment in areas with intensive livestock: is manure recycling a major source of pollution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes?â€,"Groundwater protection is one of the latest environmental battlegrounds in Europe. It is used as a major source for drinking water production all over Europe and as such, the preservation of its chemical and microbiological quality is of vital importance. In agricultural areas with intensive livestock activities, groundwater quality might be seriously compromised by the excessive use of manure as organic fertilizer. Animal manure may contain high levels of organic contaminants (e.g. antibiotics, nitrogen-containing compounds) and bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and its reuse as soil amendment could be an important route of entry of these pollutants into groundwater bodies. This project aims at broadening the knowledge about the role of animal manure recycling as a major source of groundwater pollution by: (i) analyzing selected multiple-class antibiotics and ARGs and (ii) using an innovative approach, based on the bulk characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), to uncover the chemical pattern of selected manure-impacted groundwater bodies, used as sources for drinking water production, and provide evidence about the role of manure recycling as a major source of aquifer pollution. RESOURCE is a project with high societal relevance in Spain. The shutdown of large scale manure treatment plants in 2014 and the subsequent generation of large amounts of untreated waste might endanger the good chemical and microbiological status of drinking water wells. Thus, the outcomes of this project will be highly valuable to assess the current status of groundwater bodies and will contribute in preventing serious environmental and human health issues.

The leading idea is to focus on aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) as targets of the proposed therapeutic care, which allows for tailoring of the action to the genetic expression of a specific tumor. 
WHY: Current chemotherapy still relies on an untargeted paradigm, which suffers from poisoning side effects and lacks a focused action over the tumor area. Molecular biology has definitely demonstrated the pivotal role played by microRNAs in cancer development and metastasis progression, therefore anti-miR therapy is the ultimate strategy to bet on. Working at the nanoscale will allow to achieve advanced nanomaterials that can home to the specific tumor tissue and silence the aberrantly expressed miRNAs producing a downstream therapeutic effect.
HOW: The proposed program is a very challenging project that aims to provide a groundbreaking contribution to cancer treatment. Nanomaterial science is primarily involved in this project. Porous silicon nanoparticles are intended to be used as luminescent, biodegradable, and biocompatible platforms for producing the anti-miR nanodevices. Functionalization with tumor-penetrating peptides will allow to achieve homing of the particles to the site of action, thus specifically targeting the tumor environment. Anti-miR nucleic acids, carried and delivered through the silicon nanocarriers, will ensure knockdown of target miRNAs, inducing downstream suppression of tumor growth. A complementary engineering of the anti-miR nucleic acid unit through rational design of advanced switching structures will allow for developing programmed miR-responsive tools, which are meant to reinforce the primary anti-miR effect with an extra-therapeutic action.",2017-01-15,2020-01-14,244269.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,2

1299,730308,PolyCE,Post-Consumer High-tech Recycled Polymers for a Circular Economy â€“ PolyCE,"Various activities address the WEEE value chain in order to reduce waste generation and enhance the sustainable resource management through use of recycled materials instead of their virgin counterparts. While the system for metals recycling is already well established, the rising volumes of waste plastics point to stalemates in the current plastics economy, which hamper its shift to a more circular model. Although there are individual efforts to improve the collection and recycling of WEEE plastics, the plastics value chain is still too fragmented and WEEE recycled plastics seem unattractive material for the end-user. To shift towards circular economy a systematic transformation is required, involving all actors in the value chain and encompassing the entire lifecycle of plastic materials.  
While substantially reducing the WEEE plastics generation and enhancing the use of recycled plastics in new applications, PolyCE will demonstrate the feasibility of circular plastics supply and value chain. In particular, PolyCE will elaborate harmonized set of technical requirements addressing the entire value chain and develop grade system for recycled plastics according to their material properties and final application suitability. Accordingly, PolyCE will strengthen the market for recycled plastics through an online platform integrating the different plastic grades. In parallel, the technical and economic feasibility as well as environmental benefits of using recycled plastics will be validated in several electronics demonstrators. In addition, PolyCE will provide Guidelines for designing new electronics products with recycled plastics. The projectâ€™s impact will be scaled up by involving target cities and their green public procurement initiatives; by EU-wide information and awareness raising campaigns. PolyCE will establish a feedback loop from the research activities, provide policy input regarding technical feasibilities and policy conflicts from technical perspective",2017-06-01,2021-05-31,8321995.72,,['recycling'],1,2
1300,682539,SOFTCHARGE,Charge Carrier Transport in Soft Matter: From Fundamentals to High-Performance Materials,"Charge transport (CT) in soft condensed matter is at the heart of many exciting and potentially revolutionising technologies ranging from organic photovoltaic cells to nanobioelectronic transistors. Tremendous progress has been made on these research frontiers over the last twenty years. Yet, our fundamental understanding of CT in organic and biological semiconductors (OBS) that could rationalise experimental observations and guide further advances in the field is still very limited. These materials are characterised by strong, anharmonic thermal fluctuations and small energy barriers for CT, which renders standard theories such as band theory or activated electron hopping in many cases entirely inadequate. Here, I propose the development of a disruptive computational methodâ€š based on non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD), that will open the door for ground-breaking new insight into this problem. The method will be able to access length and time scales that are presently unreachable with existing NAMD methods through an ultrafast yet error-controlled estimation of Hamiltonian matrix elements and derivatives. Applications will focus on (1) ultrapure single crystalline organic semiconductors (OS) to help uncover the true nature of charge carriers and their transport mechanism (2) structurally heterogeneous OS containing crystalline/amorphous interfaces to establish structure-charge mobility relationships (3) Ti-modified OS to aid the design of high dielectric-high mobility hybrid inorganic/organic semiconducting materials for next-generation photovoltaic devices (4) bacterial nanowire proteins to support the development of future bionanoelectronic devices. The work will (i) result in a user-friendly open software tool freely available for the scientific community (ii) yield important guidelines informing the development of high-performance OBS materials that have the potential to transform emerging technologies of the 21st century.",2016-10-01,2021-09-30,1989988.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,2
1301,821136,REMADYL,Removal of Legacy Substances from polyvinylchloride (PVC) via a continuous and sustainable extrusion process,"REMADYL aims at recycling so-called â€˜old PVCâ€™, i.e. PVC additivated with hazardous legacy substances (LS) such as low molecular weight phthalate plasticisers (mainly DEHP) and heavy metal based stabilisers (mainly lead). This â€˜old PVCâ€™ constitutes most of current hard (e.g. window frames, tubes) and soft (e.g. flooring or cables) PVC post-consumer waste. The presence of LS is a persistent barrier for PVC recycling as there are currently no economically viable solutions for their removal.
To tackle this major challenge, REMADYL will develop a breakthrough single step continuous process based on extractive extrusion technology in combination with novel solvents and melt filtration, which has the potential of rejuvenating â€˜old PVCâ€™ into REACH compliant high purity PVC tuned towards the demands of various soft and hard PVC products at market competitive cost (ca â‚¬570/ton, CAPEX and OPEX included). The process also has potential for other plastics applications, e.g. removal of (halogenated) flame retardants.
Using this process, REMADYL will demonstrate the circular use of PVC for window profiles and waterproofing sheets, providing a flagship example for the circular economy. The extracted phthalate plasticizers will be safely disposed (with energy valorisation) and the lead will be re-used in batteries.
REMADYL will deliver a breakthrough support to the Circular Economy Package and resource efficiency targets for Europe as recovered PVC will reduce incineration and landfilling. Assuming we recycle 400kton/year of â€˜old PVCâ€™ waste within 5 years after REMADYL, this will result in a reduction of ca 800ktons CO2eq and 8ktons lead emissions. This also implies the creation of ca 800 new jobs and a turnover of ca â‚¬280million. Safety aspects will be studied, leading to best practices, standardisation input and policy recommendations.

We will demonstrate the project results via production of highquality recycled PVC at TRL 5-6, reprocessing of eliminated plasticizers to new phthalate-free plasticizers and re-use of recycled polymers and additives in new flooring applications. Waste flooring will be subjected to the CreaSolvÂ® Process, which dissolves PVC-P from the material mix and eliminates undissolved matter as well as co-dissolved plasticizers in an extractive purification step (>99%). Pure PVC is recovered from the solution and solvents will be reused completely in the process. Using a controlled catalytic reaction, extracted phthalate ester plasticizers will be converted completely (> 99%) to harmless compounds with plasticizing properties. Together with tailor-made additives, both recovered products are integrated in novel PVC flooring designed for circularity. Chemical and mechanical product analysis, process simulation, LCA, SEA, and business modelling will support process development, upscale and product design. The approach addresses exactly the scope of the call because (i) innovative solutions are developed for removing undesirable substances from secondary raw materials, (ii) removed plasticizers and additives pose health or environmental risks and would adversely affect the quality of the recycled materials and (iii) the hazardous compounds are handled safely and destroyed completely. Addressing the 500.000 t PVC flooring market with recommendations on design for recycling and novel circular materials produced at TRL 5-6, the expected impact on the flooring value chain will be substantial. An interdisciplinary team of 4 RTO, 6 industrial partners (3 SME) and 1 non-profit company will finally implement the new circular economy approach into the PVC flooring industry.",2019-06-01,2023-05-31,5387768.25,,['recycling'],1,2

USABLE Packaging concept is designed to retrofit the existing state of the art packaging processing technology by controlling the chemical and physical properties of the base building blocks materials. With respect to petrochemical peers USABLE Packaging offers a sustainable end-of-life, since on one hand materials are biodegradable with no harm to the environment, on the other hand they have potential to deliver additional economic value through organic recycling for production of biogas, with the same consolidated disposal route as bio-waste, or through biotech recycling, to be used again as feedstock for the production of the same base resins for USABLE Packaging, basically closing again and again the same value chain to re-obtain virgin materials.",2019-06-01,2022-05-31,4813045.0,,['recycling'],1,2
1304,730292,PlastiCircle,Improvement of the plastic packaging waste chain from a circular economy approach,"The European plastic market is not currently aligned with the circular economy. More than 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced per year in the EU28 being recycled only 29.7%. This represents a clear loose in the plastic market loop (losses of â‚¬10.56bn). Moreover, this goes against the EU legislation on waste (high environmental impact; 23.8 Mt of CO2). 
Low recycling rates of plastic are mainly due to the situation of packaging waste (i.e. main plastic waste fraction), since it is mainly domestic residue and consequently the quality of the material collected depends on the system of segregation available and the environmental awareness of citizens.

PlastiCircle aims to develop and implement a holistic process to increase recycling rates of packaging waste in Europe. This will allow to reprocess again plastic waste in the same value chain (i.e. Circular economy; closure of plastic loop). This process is based on four axes: collection (to increase quantity of packaging collected), transport (to reduce costs of recovered plastic), sorting (to increase quality of recovered plastic), and valorization in value-added products (i.e. foam boards, automotive parts like engine covers/bumpers/dashboards, bituminous roofing membranes, garbage bags, asphalt sheets/roofing felts and urban furniture like fences/benches/protection walls). 

The target is to increase collection from 81.7% to 87% and valorization in a 9.8%. The implementation of PlastiCircle approach in Europe have the potential to increase collected plastic in 861,250t (reaching 14.14 Mt) and valorization in 1.59Mt. The valorization of this new material, represents a market value of â‚¬2.86bn-â‚¬7.95bn. Taking into account current figures of the plastic sector (turnover â‚¬350bn, 62,000 companies, 1.45M employees), this could imply creation of 500-1400 new companies and the generation of 11,900-33,000 new jobs in the medium to long term if PlastiCircle approach is extended in a EU level.",2017-06-01,2021-05-31,7774016.75,,['recycling'],1,2

It is a multi-billion Euro high-technology industry whose future competitiveness depends on a new generation of creative engineers with multi-disciplinary skills who can accelerate the development of new innovations needed for flexible, efficient power generation and sustainable aviation.

Low-emission gas turbines are confronted with unsteady combustion problems often only discovered late into development or in service because our scientific and understanding is insufficient to predict them at the design stage.  For reasons of cost and simplicity, we have been trying to solve unsteady combustion problems by studying them in single (or multiple) sectors. The lack of success of this approach is a striking gap in our community and is hindering innovation. ANNULIGhT will break this paradigm by bringing together academic and industry leaders to provide a new generation of engineers with an innovative, structured, multi-disciplinary training programme combining cutting-edge theory, computational and experimental methods that exclusively focuses on annular combustion chambers as found in real gas turbines.

ANNULIGhT presents a new and innovative research and training methodologies that exploits three revolutions that have recently taken place in the field of unsteady combustion; i) new computational methods based on Large Eddy Simulations applied to full annular chambers that can reproduce phenomena observed in real systems, ii) new annular combustion facilities enabling these phenomena to be studied in detail in the laboratory, and (iii) new high-speed imaging diagnostics which gives time-resolved information.

Increased demand, combined with poor and leaking infrastructure has increased pressure on existing supply. The situation is expected to get worse, with water consumption by the public, industry and agriculture is anticipated to rise by ~16 % over the next 15 years. In the absence of further actions to those already planned by water companies to balance supply and demand, under a high population and high climate change scenario, UK water supply deficits are projected to become more widespread by the 2050s. In particular: â€¢ The north west of England and the Yorkshire and Humber region are projected to be highly susceptible to supply-demand deficits, as well as London and the south-east. However, deficits are projected in other parts of the UK as well, including areas of south Wales and the central belt of Scotland. â€¢ At a national scale, England, Scotland and Wales are projected to be in deficit by 800 million to 3 billion litres per day by 2050 (5â€“16% of total demand) and by 1.4 billion to 5 billion litres per day by 2080 (8-29% of the total demand).  Solutions are needed to alleviate these problems and efficient use of resources is a key strategy. With an increasing drive to reduce water consumption, it is desirable to reuse water rather than ration it through low- flow showers and low- flush toilets that donâ€™t meet public expectation when water consumption can be reduced in larger quantities by recycling shower and bath water instead.  In response to recurring water shortages and ensuing legislations for sustainability we are developing an integrated â€˜hardâ€™ waste water recycling system â€˜Aqua-Gratisâ€™.

Nowadays, the social trend is to move towards a circular economy to replace the conventional â€˜take-make- consume and disposeâ€™ model of growth, where water recycling will play a significant role. Currently the annual world demand for fresh water is 64 bn m3, where just about 7.1 bn m3 comes from recycling due to the high cost of the technologies for wastewater treatment. The need to reuse water along with the scarcity of water has encouraged the development of new water treatment systems to satisfy the growing demand.

1308,759563,ReVolusions,Quantifying Recycling Fluxes of Earth Surface Materials and Volatiles in Subduction Zones using Melt Inclusions,"Plate tectonics are fundamental to the geochemical cycles that link Earthâ€™s mantle and exosphere and in turn control the atmosphereâ€™s composition and our climate. Currently a major unknown is the exact fate of surface materials at destructive plate-tectonic boundaries (subduction zones). Specifically, what proportions of volatiles, sediments and oceanic crust are transported into the deep mantle, or are returned, i.e. â€˜recycledâ€™ to the crust and atmosphere. Global recycling flux estimates, including carbon, are contradictory highlighting the need for a new, more precise approach to their quantification.

I propose to better quantify global recycling fluxes by a geochemical study of two types of subduction zones: continental and oceanic zones of which the former has higher volatile fluxes and plays a key role in past and present-day climate change. The proposed work utilises isotope analyses of deeply formed melt inclusions, tiny pockets of melt trapped in minerals, to directly determine what comes back up in subduction zones. Undertaking a multiple isotope study of these inclusions is now possible, owing to my recent success in significantly improving mass spectrometer detector amplifier technology that led to an order of magnitude improvement in precision for isotope analyses of small samples. 

I will integrate two ground-breaking techniques to identify recycled components and determine volcanic and deep mantle fluxes: 1) coupled Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratio analysis of individual melt inclusions using the high-gain amplifier method I pioneered; 2) carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of CO2 from melt inclusions using a newly developed crushing technique.

However, cross-border sales constituted only 10.6% of Europe's total online sales in 2013, despite the European Commissionâ€™s (ECâ€™s) estimate of â‚¬415 billion annual contribution to European economy from a European Digital Single Market (DSM), which is currently one of the top priorities of the EC. Besides language barriers and differences in legislature across the EU, the EC states that low engagement can be attributed to: 1) high compliance and delivery costs, 2) low consumer trust regarding foreign retailersâ€™ delivery and after-sales support, and 3) low consumer awareness of foreign retailers. 

The EC has proposed several trade policy measures to facilitate a DSM. Yet, complementary operational business strategies that enable cross-border profitability under aforementioned challenges have not been explored, while trade measures are still under way. This project aims to develop an interdisciplinary modeling and optimization framework in order to study the dynamics of cross-border alliances between retailers for enhanced cross-border customer acquisition, distribution, and after-sales support. This much-needed framework will provide timely and reproducible models, leading to win-win horizontal cross-border alliances that leverage unique strengths of local retailers under high distribution and compliance costs, low cross-border consumer awareness, and consumer concerns on cross-border delivery and after-sales support.

1312,844655,SMOLAC,Theoretical design of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors for organic solar cells with improved efficiency.,"Organic solar cells are lightweight, mechanically flexible and potentially printable devices. To split an exciton, these cells use a mixture of electron donor and acceptor materials. At present, most of the electron acceptors are made up of fullerenes or their derivatives. However, fullerenes exhibit only weak light absorption in the visible spectrum. Hence, practically half of the active material in the solar cell does not collect light and thus does not contribute to exciton and charge generation, thereby limiting the maximum efficiency of organic solar cells to 12%. 
Recent experimental and theoretical works show that it is possible to improve this low efficiency by replacing fullerene acceptors with small molecules (strong dyes). These strong dyes can change the energy profile of the donor-acceptor interface in a way that improves the solar cell behavior by causing it to favor more efficient charge-transferred state splitting. The mechanism by which the efficiency is improved is complex and not well-understood and is mediated by the strong dyeâ€™s ability to alter the electrostatic forces felt by generated excitons. However, a rational approach to design such non-fullerene acceptors on a molecular level, accounting for the complex electrostatic interactions, has not been developed.
In-depth molecular level understanding of donor-(non-fullerene) acceptor interfaces, including long-range electrostatic effects, is the first goal of this proposal. It will include simulations of morphologies and evaluation of electrostatic forces at donor-non-fullerene acceptor interfaces for several experimentally well-characterized systems. The second step will include the design of a pre-screening workflow for new acceptors, focusing on the optimization of the efficiency of the charge-transferred state splitting and minimization of the open circuit voltage losses.",2019-12-01,2021-11-30,174806.4,,['solar cell'],1,2

CSPs incorporate software-defined networking (SDN) and virtualization in their CDCs to ensure full utilization of server resources and reduce the power and electricity that are consumed.

1314,840163,EXPAND,Examining pan-neotropical diasporas,"The expansion of farmers and their languages was a key process in shaping cultural geographies across the globe during the late Holocene. Many human expansions in the past are linked to periods of climate change, which would have offered opportunities and constraints for migrations. In lowland South America, the extent of major language families coincides with the expansion of archaeological traditions ~3-2 kyr BP together with the dissemination of polyculture agroforestry. This period was marked by increased precipitation and forest expansion, as documented in paleoecological and paleoclimate records, ultimately suggesting that climate change may have played a role in tropical farmers' diasporas by expanding the areas where polyculture agroforestry could be practised. However, an evaluation of that hypothesis is hampered by the lack of unified archaeological databases, absence of land cover reconstructions for the late Holocene, and poor integration of archaeology and paleoecology in South America. To overcome those drawbacks, this project will integrate continent-wide archaeological and paleoecological datasets through computer modeling architecture to test the role of environmental drivers in late Holocene cultural diasporas. I will compile all available dates, coordinates and cultural information for late Holocene archaeological sites in lowland South America, model vegetation changes from all available paleoecological records, and integrate those datasets using state-of-the-art computational modeling techniques. I will employ agent-based modeling to simulate scenarios of climate-driven human expansions that will be tested based on the empirical archaeological data gathered over the course of the project.

The Rab11 family is particularly important in determining the aggressiveness of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Despite its importance, the machinery that guides Rab11 trafficking and the functions of polarized trafficking are not clear in HGSOC. I aim to determine how recycling endosomes are positioned within HGSOC cells invading extracellular matrix, using BioID-based proteomics (a proximity labelling approach well established in the host lab) to identify the Rab11-associated machinery in HGSOC cells. I further aim to actively manipulate the dynamics of Rab11 positive endosomes in invading cells by developing a magnetogenetic approach to reposition endosomes in live cells, using a combination of my developed skills (including live imaging, protein engineering). Both cutting-edge methods will be applied in the most physiological and cancer relevant context to lend clinical relevance to our observations. Combining these innovative approaches will provide molecular detail and mechanistic insight to elucidate how localised endocytic trafficking controls tumour-stroma interactions in the metastatic niche and contributes to HGSOC lethality. This work will further provide targets for therapies aimed at suppressing metastasis and preventing relapse in HGSOC, a lethal form of ovarian cancer that has one of the worst survival rates (<40% 5-year survival).

AgriChemWhey will build a first-of-a-kind, industrial-scale biorefinery with integrated symbiotic industrial and agricultural value chains that will valorise over 25,000 tonnes (100% dry matter) per annum of excess WP and DLP to several added value products for growing global markets including lactic acid, polylactic acid, minerals for human nutrition and bio-based fertilisers. This will be achieved through a coordinated investment process and development path to realise the Flagship plant, representing the first major industrial venture to convert residues from food processing, as second generation feedstocks, to value added bio-based products. The Flagship will prove the techno-economic viability of the innovative WP/DLP-to-lactic acid biorefinery technology and will establish a new value chain for industrial symbiosis with other local actors for the production of high value sustainable food and feed (including high quality mushrooms) products from other side streams, as an enhanced circular bioeconomy approach to agriculture and agri-food waste. This offers society and industry the opportunity for greater resource efficiency - less food waste, more products from the same starting material (milk), and integration of food and non-food material production.

These threats together with market trends such as increasing environmental conscience, preference for green materials and an excellent clay bricksâ€™ public image creates a major market opportunity that GrÃ¥sten Brickworks (GB) aims to pursuit through the development of an innovative building component which will enable a paradigm change within the construction market and recycling in Europe.
GB vision is to take the final steps of commercial and technical development and product maturation towards the commercialization of CleanTechBlock (CTB) â€“ a patented multifunctional sandwich-block based on the combination of two clay brick shells and foamed recycled glass. CTBâ€™s advantages over bricks are compelling as the insulation, strength properties and construction price are similar and it offers: an overall increase in the living area (3-5%), a reduction in the overall house wall construction time (5x faster), while reducing maintenance requirements and transportation costs. It also contributes to the mitigation of environmental problems due to an increase of glass waste recycling, decrease of raw material (clay) and energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
CLEANTECHBLOCK2 project is expected to significantly enhance the profitability and competitiveness of GB, with an expected sales turnover of â‚¬67M and profits of â‚¬15M, 6 years after commercialization in the environmentally conscious construction segment (both residential and non-residential) of primary targeted markets â€“ Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

1319,724436,HISTONEMEMORY,New and Old Histones in Epigenetic Cell Memory,"Cell type specific organization of DNA into chromatin is an important determinant of gene expression and cell identity. During cell division, epigenetic information in chromatin must be transmitted to daughter cells in order to maintain cell identity or commit to a developmental program. However, it remains unknown how epigenetic states are inherited during cell division. Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic cell memory thus represents a major challenge in biology critical to understand development and disease.

Chromatin undergoes genome-wide disruption during DNA replication and histone marks are diluted 2-fold due to new histone deposition. Yet, how this impacts on establishment and maintenance of gene expression programs is not known. I hypothesize that chromatin replication represents a critical window for epigenetic cell memory and cell fate decisions, and predict that three histone-based processes play critical roles in guarding cell identity: 1) new histone deposition to regulate nucleosome occupancy and transcription factor (TF) binding, 2) accurate transmission of old modified histones by dedicated recycling machinery, and 3) recruitment of regulatory proteins to new and old histones to direct epigenome maintenance. To dissect these events mechanistically and test causal roles in cell fate decisions, I propose a research program integrating explorative proteomics and histone chaperone structure-function analysis with stem cell biology and new cutting-edge genomic tools developed by my research group. 

The proposed research will 1) identify novel mechanisms of histone chaperoning and deposition specific to new and old histones, 2) reveal how nucleosome assembly govern TF binding during DNA replication, and 3) address the significance of old histone recycling and new histone deposition for pluripotency and commitment. This will provide a major advance in understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern epigenetic cell memory.",2017-05-01,2022-04-30,1999750.0,,['recycling'],1,2

This means that Europe aims to transition to a largely, or fully, renewable power system. This is however not the only energy policy aim: besides a transition to renewables, further aims include an energy efficiency increase and demand reduction; liberalisation of the power markets and exposure of renewables to competition; and europeanisation of renewable energy policy, power grids, and the creation of a European internal power market. Here, I investigate whether and how these policies interact and affect the chances for and costs of a transition to a renewable power system; how the other aims constrain the options for renewables; and how policy conflicts can be resolved. Current policy discourse treats these policy aims either as independent or synergistic. My hypothesis is that they are not at all independent and that pursuing the aims of demand reduction, liberalisation and europeanisation strongly influences the transition to renewables, and that the aims are partially antagonistic, implying a need for trade-offs. The purpose of my research is to test these hypotheses and explore the policy synergies or antagonisms, by investigating yet under-researched aspects of the interactions. These include how reaching the other aims influences the transition dynamics; how key actors may alter their behaviour due to such other developments; and how reaching another policy aim impacts the stability of a fully renewable power system. I adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on transition research, engineering, political science and economics, with each perspective adding a piece of the puzzle. The answers will contribute to both the disciplinary and the policy-driven renewable energy research, and provide insights to help policy-makers define less conflicting policies, thus supporting the European transition to renewables.",2017-08-01,2022-07-31,1499940.0,,['renewable energy'],1,2

We will path the way for enabling the industrial exploitation of the full characteristics of nanoparticles by introducing the SP1 protein in industrial materials by means of standard industrial processes.  Nowadays, two major serious technological problems impede the effective use of nanoparticles such as graphene, carbon nanofibers and carbon nano-tubes.
The strong tendency of nanoparticles agglomerates within materials results in the desired propertiesâ€™ damaged.
The successful implementation and optimized utilization of functional nanoparticles into final products requires robust and cost-effective homogenous nanoparticle dispersion within the nanomaterial matrix. However, it is difficult to produce nanoparticle dispersions with specific particle sizes, concentrations, viscosities and purities on an industrial scale (large mass production rate and low energy consumption) .
The SP1 protein is the solution for effective means of nanoparticle deagglomeration and dispersion within materials, resulting in the following features enhancement.

recycling yield is only 15% due to the low quality of the materials. This leads to increased prices and waiting times for highquality
furniture and interior products which rely on solid/old wood sources.
At JGrabner we have invested over â‚¬5 million in the development of our technology, creating a solution to this problem that
only uses thin layers of the expensive old wood on top of high-quality plywood substrates, thereby increasing the recycling
yield to 60%. Our innovative process creates toxin-free, wood-based materials that not only rival the visual and haptic
experience of solid and old wood products but also surpasses them in terms of costs, customizability, durability,
sustainability and availability. These quality standards cannot be reached by any of the competing technologies. With
GREEN BOARD, we will bring our technology to the interior and furniture sectors, thereby creating a new market for old
wood materials. We offer never-seen-before applications of old wood, such as floorings or wall interiors which have been
elusive till now, due to the special needs of the bulk old wood materials. With GREEN BOARD, we can customize any wood

This cost-effective coating technology â€“ called nanoHPcs â€“ solves wear and corrosion problems in critical components of plastics extrusion machines. Today, plastics and fibre-reinforced plastics have become the first material of use in many sectors (construction, automotive, aviation, etc.), being in many cases lighter, cheaper, more resistant and recyclable than metal. This highly affects the production equipment, as for plastics extrusion, machines must cope with increasing production amounts and requirements. Even more challenging is the extrusion of waste materials and of plastics aggregates with abrasive metal, ceramic, glass and wooden particles. The challenge in this industry is to make recycled plastics as pricely attractive as raw plastics material. Since recycled plastic is much more abrasive, extrusion machines must not lose any performance through incorporating the recycled material. Compared to conventional coating methods, nanoHPcs can enhance the share of plastics recycling in the industry by at least 10%, displaying a fantastic price-performance ratio, a reduction of more than 50% of production costs of critical components and of up to 70% of coating manufacturing and finish processing costs.

Such promising, yet underdeveloped technology needs fundamental breakthroughs in the development of efficient electrode catalysts, i.e. electrocatalysts, for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2-RR). In fact, none of the currently known catalysts has adequate efficiency.
In this project, I propose to investigate well-defined ruthenium oxide (RuOx) and molybdenum sulphide (MoSx) nano catalysts for the CO2-RR. The goal is to discover new, efficient catalysts on the basis of fundamental insight. In the first phase, model RuOx and MoSx catalysts (nanoparticles, thin films) will be investigated to elucidate the physicochemical parameters that control their performance. In the second phase, synthetic strategies will be applied to enhance the catalyst activity and selectivity; these will be based on the preparation of metal substituted RuOx and on the exploitation of catalyst-support interactions.
The proposed investigation is:
â€¢ Timely, given the relevance attributed by the European Union and by the chemical industry to the research on CO2 re-utilization strategies that involve the integration of renewable energy sources;
â€¢ Innovative. RuOx and MoSx are promising, yet largely unexplored catalysts for the CO2-RR. The strategies devised to enhance their performance are radically different from what has been proposed so far.
â€¢ Expected to provide high impact. The structure-activity descriptors identified through this study will open new perspectives for the design of efficient catalysts via controlled synthetic processes.

1329,778065,MUBIC,Mushroom and biogas production in a circular economy,"The problems: Biogas is important for the European renewable energy transition as it turns waste streams such as manure and sewage into biogas, and provides CO2-neutral energy. But the efficiency is low because the methane producing bacteria in the biogas digester have trouble accessing the energy locked in fibrous materials such as cellulose and lignin. This fraction passes through the biogas plant unused and is incinerated or spread on agricultural land. At the same time, mushroom producers must buy substrate to grow mushrooms and pay to discard it after use.

The solution: The AST technology creates a resource cycle between biogas production and mushroom production, reducing costs of mushroom production by up to 50% and utilizing also the fibrous fraction in biogas plants. The innovation is a technology where the fibrous fraction from biogas is used for growing mushrooms, and then returned to the biogas plant, offering improved economy as well as significant environmental benefits to both the mushroom and biogas industry. 

The project: The AST concept has already been proven in pilot scale, and the next step is a full scale demonstration plant. In this project two AST plants are scaled up and integrated with mushroom production facilities and a biogas plant, respectively. It is essential for the market introduction and thus the commercial success to demonstrate such commercial operation for customers to invest in such plants.

Impact: The project will increase the competitiveness of the European mushroom industry currently under strong pressure from China, as well as the biogas industry, suffering from high operational costs.

I recently showed that loss of Mecp2, the cause of Rett syndrome and some cases of autism, differentially affects NMDAR development at cortical synapses on specific cell-types: slowing down the development in excitatory pyramidal neurons and accelerating the maturation in parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons. Genetic manipulation of NMDAR expression in Mecp2-deficient mice rescued both cortical function and the premature NMDAR maturation in PV cells. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that this cell-type specific disruption of NMDAR development leads to an imbalance in excitation and inhibition in the developing cortical circuits.  To test this idea, I will combine single cell genomic and cell-type specific recording techniques to elucidate how Mecp2 controls the development of synaptic receptors and the impact on network function. In Aim 1, I will use cutting-edge techniques for single-cell RNA sequencing and synaptic recordings of NMDAR maturation in cortical cultures to identify novel cell-type specific mechanisms underlying NMDAR development and the regulation by Mecp2. In Aim 2, I will investigate the functional effects of Mecp2 deficiency and altered NMDAR maturation on the development of cortical network activity using two-photon calcium imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. As a neuroscientist and neurologist, this training will prepare me for an independent research career addressing the circuit-based defects underlying Rett syndrome and autism.

1334,641585,COREGAL,Combined Positioning-Reflectometry Galileo Code Receiver for Forest Management,"Biomass mapping has gained increased interest for bioenergy, climate research and mitigation activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (e.g. REDD initiative).

However, continuous deforestation activity and forest management requires frequent and accurate monitoring which can be expensive and difficult to attain. In Brazil, optical satellite data is typically used by government but even such does not allow accurate enough mapping due cloud coverage, requiring combination of other sources such as in-situ and air-borne measurements. Furthermore, satellite radar signals can penetrate clouds but still today the spatial resolution is not sufficient.

In COREGAL, a low cost unmanned fixed-plane Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and service for biomass mapping will allow wide scale mapping in the Brazilian context of forest management. A first of a kind combined Position-Reflectometry Galileo receiver will be developed as main sensor for platform positioning and biomass estimation, the latter using reflected GNSS signals (also called GNSS-R) on tree canopies. High positioning accuracy (centimetre level) is required for surface point reflection determination, which is challenging for remote areas where no GNSS infrastructure is available as in the case of many forests in Brazil. However, Galileo AltBOC E5 signals offer unprecedented pseudorange measurement quality which can be used for novel high accuracy positioning.

The UAV will be equipped and tested with a COREGAL receiver and optical cameras for aerial mapping and biomass estimation, enabling wide scale low cost mapping: UAV mapping is at least one order of magnitude lower cost than manned air-borne missions while GNSS-R can be seen as bi-static radar replacing expensive, heavy and power consuming radars.

Willisits Engineering Ltd. was established in 2009 to develop world-class electric vehicle drive systems and other innovative technologies. A few years ago we started the development of an underwater river power plant system (hydro generator) and in 2016 we built a prototype and demonstrated its operation in a relevant environment (river â€“ TRL6). The development was a success but due to limited resources and other developments the commercialisation of it was put on hold.
Recently we have received interest from companies who approached us with application areas for our technology. Namely, to use our hydro generator for the charging of electronic vehicles and to provide power for infrastructures located near (or on) rivers. Based on this interest we carried out an initial market study and found that there is serious potential to use our existing results and focus it on this new application. 
We have decided to apply for SME Instrument Phase 1 funding to carry out a feasibility study in order to strengthen our initial findings and based on the outcome proceed for Phase 2 to produce the first commercial hydro powered electric vehicle charging station.",2018-03-01,2018-07-31,50000.0,,['electric vehicle'],1,2

The demand of plastics is increasing constantly. More than 300 million tons of plastic are consumed each year. This leads to 30 million tons of plastic waste per year. The HLW TEC GmbH can handle this waste.
The HLW TEC GmbH will provide environmental friendly solution for industrial thermoplastic and elastomeric waste, as well as an efficient access to high quality raw material.
Our goal is to increase the ratio of significant feedstock recycling by utilizing industrial plastic and elastomer waste.
Nowadays there are no conclusive solutions for the recovered substance cycle for plastic material which can ensure the same quality as the primary synthetic materials. 
The HLW method allows to preserve industrial waste, even elastomers, in the raw material cycle. Processed materials are brought into the original mixture without any loss of characteristics. 
Since the demand for plastic materials increased by 9.5% every year since 1950 Europe faces austerity of feedstock. In addition to that one of EUâ€™s goals to reduce waste dumping up to 0% which seems to be difficult regarding the nowadays waste salvage in Europe. The HLW-TEC method can serve as a solution.

The technological feasibility has already been demonstrated; therefore the project outcome will be a system that is certified, marketable and clearly positive on cost-benefit side.
The waste in the scope of the SINTRAN project taints and environmental risk factor. Its humidity is high; therefore simple combustion is challenging and may be hazardous. The state-of-the-art handling methodology does not eliminate the risk of soil pollution (e.g. heavy metals may leak into the soil or water).

The leaves of a single tree, e.g., can cover the area of 10.000 m^2 while every mm^2 contains more than 10^8 highly efficient light-harvesting complexes. For future photovoltaic devices, light-managing surfaces and photonic devices it will thus be beneficial to adopt principles of self-assembly. Advances in design and low-cost production of DNA nanostructures allow us to challenge nature. By combining the assembly power of bottom-up DNA origami with top-down lithography it will be possible to fabricate functional nanostructured materials designed on the molecular level while reaching macroscopic dimensions.
With the goal to boost energy conversion rates, I will design DNA structures that grow from pre-patterned surfaces and assemble into interpenetrating 3D networks that exhibit the highest possible contact area for electron donor and acceptor molecules in organic photovoltaic devices. Spectral tuning through carefully designed dye arrangements will complement these efforts.
Custom-tailored photonic crystals built from lattices of DNA origami structures will control the flow of light. By incorporating dynamic DNA reconfigurability and colloidal nanoparticles at freely chosen positions, intelligent materials that respond to external cues such as light or heat are projected.

However, the restricted volume between the fairing and the spacecraft sidewall limits the number & the dimension of rigid solar panels during launch. Therefore, the answer for this growing power demand lies neither in stacking more rigid solar arrays, nor by marginal efficiency improvements on III-V multi-junction solar cells, but rather in innovative/disruptive photovoltaic solutions. More solar cells per unit of volume are needed in stowed configuration, and flexible solar arrays are the only answer for this high-power challenge.  

In this context, ALFAMA project brings answers for the mass, cost & power challenge, with ambitions at each level of the solar array: 
- The mechanical architecture, with a modular & retractable deployment system 
- The photovoltaic assembly fabrication process, with printed harness & lamination for easier integration, manufacturing and high voltage protection 
- The PVA structure, with thin flexible layers for high power/mass & power/volume ratio, adapted to epitaxial lift-off 
- The solar cells, with the development of highly efficient & lightweight III-V IMM lift-off cells.

This project bridges the typical gap between device fabrication and material science, thus allowing real-world performance to guide development of new functional materials. Computational insight into electronic structure of p-type semiconductors will drive material selection, based on the prediction that certain chemistries lead to disperse valence bands and inherently high hole mobility, thus relaxing the requirement for degenerate doping for sufficient p-type conductivity. Material development will be coupled to rapid-feedback testing in state-of-the-art silicon heterojunction (SHJ) and perovskite solar cells (PSC). In both technologies, multi-layer front contacts currently provide several functions, e.g. electrical passivation, carrier selectivity, and conductivity.

But only 5% of worldwide produced plastic is today recycled, being one of the least recycled material. Plastic wastes that are not recycled are called Ultimate scrap residues and come mostly from End-of-life vehicles (ELV) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Today, companies producing Ultimate scrap residue have two options to discharge this waste: 1) Landfill disposal where they must pay a considerable fee (120â‚¬/t in 2015) with a strong environmental impact but this practice is expected to be soon banned in Europe; 2) selling and sending the wastes to Asia (mostly in China) at a price of 250â‚¬/ton but with the requirement of investing in expensive pre-treatment systems and with also negative environmental impact. Our TRIBOSORT technology is a unique solution that allows to 1) recycle all ultimate scrap residues from ELV and WEEE, 2) separate its valuable plastic components with a purity of 95% minimum, 3) provide an industrial scale solution with a production capacity of 1.5t/h, 4) produce a final recycled plastic material directly marketable to manufacturers, 5) provide a Recycle certificate along with our final products.

The current economic system is strongly based on consuming and discarding these materials and products. Combined with the growing population and strong economic growth this leads to a rapid depletion of the earthâ€™s valuable resources while creating huge amounts of waste. To overcome this, it is essential to change our current linear economy and move towards a sustainable circular economy in which resources are reused and recycled while eliminating the production of waste. 

Many circular initiatives have failed to create sustainable material cycles due to a lack of usable information on material contents. This information is of utmost importance to allow re-use and recycling of materials and thus, to maintain the materialâ€™s value. Consequently, this will result in the thoughtful deconstruction of products, maintaining their valuable materials and subsequent re-use or recycling, minimizing waste.

To facilitate this highly needed information exchange and to facilitate the vital transition towards a circular economy, Madaster Services BV and Winvision BV have developed the disruptive Madaster ICT Platform which, for the first time, is able to precisely document and store material-related information of products. This innovative solution specifically focusses on the construction sector with the strong ambition to eliminate waste.

Globally, data centres consume 3% of electricity (higher than the UKâ€™s total consumption) and account for 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions. That gives them the same carbon footprint as the airline industry.
Although various energy efficiency gains are being made, the state of the art for data transmission within the data centre is inefficient. Optical Transceiver Modules (OTM), at 40Gbps and above, use power-hungry SiGe/BiCMOS technology in their Integrated Circuits. With a typical, large data centre containing at least 800,000 OTMs, they are responsible for around 8% of total energy use.
HiLight Semiconductor Ltd, a â€œFabless Chip Companyâ€, has developed MERCURY, an innovative Integrated Circuit chipset, pioneering the use of industry-standard CMOS technology to drive 100Gbps OTMs. With the use of standard CMOS, on 12' wafers, we are able to produce our Chipset for significantly less than our competitors' BiCMOS on 8' wafers. Together with our low power innovation, we expect to displace BiCMOS technology entirely over the next few years, just as has been seen previously, at lower datarates.
Meeting all industry standards, MERCURY achieves 100Gbps with less than half (57%) the power consumption of BiCMOS solutions. Based on European data centres' energy use and our expected global sales rates, by 2022, MERCURY will save 1.5 Billion kWh every year in Europe and 6 Billion kWh/year globally, helping meet the EC Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres.

During a lifetime, each of us synthesizes a light-yearâ€™s length of DNA, but this process is so robust that few of us will develop cancer. In eukaryotes, DNA is packed into chromatin, a hierarchical DNA-protein assembly of which the nucleosome forms the basic unit. Chromatin replication convolves DNA replication with the duplication and reassembly of all DNA-associated proteins. Understanding the coupling between these processes has fundamental implications for epigenetic inheritance and cancer.
The goal of this proposal is to gain spatiotemporal insight into chromatin replication by using our biophysical expertise in replication and chromosomal dynamics to build up a mechanistic timeline of the process. We will harness recent advances in the reconstitution of the yeast replisome alongside our novel, high-throughput single-molecule approach to visualize and quantify the collaboration between a single yeast replisome and the histone chaperones to achieve chromatin replication. We will:
â€¢Monitor the assembly of the replisome on chromatin and visualize how nucleosomes impact its progression.
â€¢Quantify how the replisome and histone chaperones disrupt nucleosomes and retain histones for further processing.
â€¢Detect the deposition of newly synthesized histones behind the replisome and reveal the interactions between replisome components and histone chaperones that couple replication to nucleosome assembly.
â€¢Report on the phenomenon of epigenetic inheritance by imaging histone recycling between parental and daughter DNA. We will examine its timing and efficiency, the conformations of reassembled nucleosomes, and any preferential recycling to either daughter DNA.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 has been identified as the main driver of this greening. On the contrary, human management is usually reported to cause land degradation and deforestation, especially in humid areas where population pressure is high. This project aims at challenging this simplistic view by introducing the Chinese karst regions as a study area known as one of the worldâ€™s most fragile and degraded ecosystems, but also a hot-spot of global greening hosting mega-engineering conservation projects which are the largest in human history. Here my research hypothesis is that conservation efforts in Chinaâ€™s karst regions offset degradation and lead to an increased carbon sequestration with global impact. I aim to (1) develop methods to assess aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) losses and gains with newest satellite data, (2) attribute ABC dynamics to conservation and degradation using inventory data, (3) test the sensitivity of ABC to climate extremes and explain how conservation efforts affect these, and (4) assess the regional and global impact of observed ABC changes as a climate change mitigation measure. Whereas the host institution is world leading in satellite based assessments of climate induced greening of global drylands, me and my project will add a new dimension to the hostâ€™s portfolio: the human induced greening of a humid zone. Moreover, the host is world leading in the application of newest satellite data for vegetation cover and ABC assessments and has direct contacts to data developers (e.g. vegetation optical depth based on low frequency passive microwave data).

To ensure that the future networks meet  both the service and the sustainability requirements, energy-efficient designs and integration of renewable-energy sources into the network infrastructure are needed.  To address the sudden capacity demands, on-demand network deployment is desired, instead of maintaining a permanently over-engineered infrastructure.

Graphene was not just a scientific breakthrough from a physical point of view, but it also opened the door to research on atomically thin materials. Nowadays, many materials with a wide range of properties (metals, semiconductors, insulators, superconductorsâ€¦) have been achieved in a 2D configuration, and still there are more to come.
The proposed project OPTOvanderWAALS aims to the fabrication and study of complex van der Waals heterostructures to study inter-layer excitonic phenomena and use these excitonic effects to fabricate ultra-high-performance optoelectronic devices. Novel intermediate layers between 2D semiconductors will be employed to automatically switch on and off photodetectors with an extraordinarily low dark current, which will be translated in an ultra-high-performance. These intermediate layers will be also used in photovoltaic cells as recombination region, allowing the recombination of unbalanced electron-hole pairs and avoiding charge build-up in the cells, resulting in an increased open-circuit voltage and, therefore, higher efficiency than state-of-the-art 2D photovoltaic cells. Besides, all of these heterostructures will be fabricated following a new procedure to align the crystal structure of different layers by second harmonic generation imaging, resulting in an optimized interaction between layers that will ultimately lead to ultra-high-performance devices in a new generation of flexible and transparent optoelectronics.",2018-04-01,2020-03-31,166156.8,,['photovoltaic'],1,2

I will build on my extensive knowledge of nanomaterial science to develop this 3D mapping tool combining a tailor-made library of antibody-tagged quantum dots with electron microscopy 3D image reconstruction and X-ray elemental mapping. The resulting versatile method has multiple uses far beyond analyzing protein coronas.

The proposed project has 4 objective which will be reached over 24 months, within 13 work packages, including training-through-research and acquisition of transferable and complementary skills, contributing to the advancement of my career beyond this project, as a future independent researcher. The main objective is developing a tool to allow 3D mapping of protein epitopes at the surface of nanosized objects, with applications far beyond my test systems. The other objectives involve testing my tool to map epitopes in the protein corona at nanoparticles and study their interaction with cell receptors, focusing on spatial distribution of specific receptors.

However, HFC gases used in heat pumps contribute to global warming by trapping heat radiating off the Earth. Global negotiations to eliminate them have concluded only in October 2016 in Kigali. 150 nations agreed to stop selling new HFC based equipment from 2019. 

Global challenge is to find a suitable replacement for HFC by 2019. R290 is most suitable replacement gas for home and light commercial use as it can be used in the existing, most common, R22 mechanical equipment. However, being flammable at 470C it requires spark-proof electrical components that increase costs by about 30%. Alfa Klima has innovated the design of R290 heat pump systems (PropSafe) so that they do not require spark-proof components. Offering safer alternative at 30% lower cost is a significant added value and it gives Alfa Klima design a first mover advantage in both new installations and R22 replacement.

As of 2015, only 1% of used REE were recycled in the EU and 80% of the mining operations were performed in China, hence representing a major Sword of DamoclÃ¨s for the rest of the worldâ€™s economy. With SYNEXTRACT, we propose to leverage on discoveries made (and patented) within ERC-Adv REE-CYCLE, related to new extracting liquid-liquid process. Hence, SYNEXTRACT will try to implement these discoveries in a Solid-liquid extraction process based on Simulated Moving Bed Chromatography. Such process would complement nicely the liquid-liquid one. Indeed, in case of success, it would not only represent a new approach in chromatography, but it would also enable highly flexible purification  processes for REEs containing waste streams, that can easily be adapted to various waste stream lixiviates. Due to the high selectivity, it could even be applied to low REE concentration lixiviates. The process flexibility is one of the main bottleneck to enable their recycling as the research and development cost currently necessary to adapt current liquid-liquid extraction processes prohibits it. It should also be mentioned that SYNEXTRACT process would be all aqueous, therefore avoid the use of organic solvent and would drastically reduce process wastes and running costs.",2017-07-01,2018-12-31,150000.0,,['recycling'],1,2

AMRC Castings, a department of the University of Sheffield (USFD), is part of the UKâ€™s High Value Manufacturing Catapult.  AMRC Castingsâ€™ mission is to develop and disseminate casting technology to the benefit of the cast metal and manufacturing sectors.  
Based on the Topic Description, and on AMRC Castingsâ€™ long experience of similar projects, we believe that project SkyLight would enable the investment casting process to deliver greater geometrical complexity, reduce defects by 50%, optimise stiffness, and deliver weight saving of 15% to 30% and cost saving of 30% compared to conventionally fabricated multi-piece assemblies, along with significant environmental benefits for both the manufacturing and the use phase of the component.  
AMRC Castings helped Sulzer to achieve an improvement in pump absorbed efficiency - saving 10% on the power demand.  AMRC Castingsâ€™ PatternlessÂ® process helped Rolls-Royce reduce the time from CAD model to prototypes from 6 months to 6 weeks, and developed more accurate naval propellers for the VT Group that are seen as setting a new standard for others to follow.  AMRC Castingsâ€™ MEGAshellÂ® process enables ceramic moulds with dimensions of up to 2m3 to be manufactured so that heavy section valve castings weighing several tonnes can be manufactured 34% lighter than the sand cast equivalent and reducing machining costs by over 50%.  
This year, AMRC Castings is installing what is believed to be the largest furnace for casting titanium aerospace components in Western Europe - a 1000kg titanium melter - to complement its existing state-of-the-art casting facilities.
AMRC Castings has participated in 21 EU-funded collaborative research projects including 8 projects as coordinator - including research projects such as FASTCAST and events to achieve the greater participation of the castings sector in EU-funded research programmes.",2017-02-01,2020-01-31,801040.25,,['skylight'],1,2

However, estimates of the global distribution of terrestrial carbon sinks and sources are highly uncertain. Constraining the inaccuracy of carbon estimates is essential to support effective forest management and future climate mitigation. A better understanding of forest growth dynamics will improve our understanding of the carbon cycle and mechanisms responsible for terrestrial carbon sources and sinks, reducing uncertainties on their magnitude and distribution.  In the 3D-FOGROD project, I aim to improve our understanding of forest growth dynamics and evaluate the role of elevated CO2 levels on forest growth. I will achieve this by using novel 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) techniques, unique datasets and state-of-the-art modelling approaches to (1) accurately quantify forest growth using terrestrial LiDAR data in a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment; (2) improve historical and future simulated forest growth dynamics using LiDAR derived forest structure for a range of forest ecosystems; and (3) develop and disseminate recommendations for climate mitigation actions to policy makers based on new insights in forest growth dynamics and carbon cycling.  The proposed scientific innovation and applicability will benefit the EU not only by generating new knowledge and publications in high-profile scientific journals, which will contribute to the enhancement of EU scientific excellence, but also by contributing to EU commitments to the Paris climate conference (COP 21) agreement that aims to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5Â°C.

High spatiotemporal resolution LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER products are urgently needed in many terrestrial applications including crop and forest management. However, the trade-off in traditional remote sensing sensors between temporal and spatial resolutions hinders the generation of such products. The launch of Sentinel-2 satellites, with spatial resolution of 10-20 m and 5-day temporal sampling (in tandem), opens a new paradigm in satellite vegetation monitoring. The proposed project â€œMOVESâ€ will develop an operational algorithm for retrieving LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER from Sentinel-2 data. An easily-invertible radiative transfer model (RTM) will be firstly developed, which will apply a universal model framework for all vegetation types (continuous vs discrete) and terrains (horizontal vs sloping). In this project, the hybrid training and domain adaption paradigms will be introduced into the retrieval of LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER, to enhance the transferability of the retrieval algorithm and achieve spatiotemporally consistent retrieval. The Copernicus ground-based observations (GBOC) and FLUXNET sites will be used to validate the proposed algorithm and assess its potential in the monitoring of vegetation status and functioning. The project is conceived to combine the prominent expertise of the hosting institute in biophysical variable retrieval and remote sensing ecological application, with my well-demonstrated RTM development skills. Overall, MOVES will facilitate the delivery of Sentinel-2 LAI/FAPAR/FCOVER products of physical consistence and high accuracy, and underpin new avenues for the development of high spatiotemporal frequency vegetation monitoring systems.",2019-10-01,2021-09-30,172932.48,,['forest management'],1,1

Among consumers, the most desired health benefits in food products and supplements are â€˜supports immune functionâ€™ and â€˜increases resistance to infectionsâ€™.

NutriLeads is a dynamic Health Ingredients company developing crop-derived food ingredients with clinically proven health benefits. With its proprietary lead ingredient NL01, having completed preclinical data and proven safety in humans, NutriLeads is on track to become the first company to launch an ingredient with an approved health claim for supporting immune function and increasing infection resistance. Targeted end-users of NL01 containing food products (dietary supplements, medical- and functional foods) are young adults, adults, elderly and patients, aiming to support their health and immune status.

Nutrileads selected a common crop from which NL01 can be isolated, a game-changer for its commercial success,and developed the isolation process for NL01 up to small scale industrial plant production. In this project, Nutrileads will perform medium scale-up of the production process to 250 kg. Nutrileads will complete the data package for NL01 with a clinical study in a relevant population with increased infection risk to support the health claims on NL01, register NL01 as â€˜Novel Foodâ€™ and obtain European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regulatory advice on registration as â€˜Food for Specific Medical Purposesâ€™.

1362,805344,DeCO-HVP,Decouple Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to High Value Products,"This programme aims to convert carbon dioxide into high value hydrocarbon products using carbon neutral electrochemical methods. High value products are materials that may be used as carbon based chemical feedstocks and as synthetic fuels, reducing the ever-present demand on oil and natural gas to fulfil these needs. The project is within the remit of an international ambition to valorise carbon dioxide waste and reduce environmentally harmful greenhouse gas generation, as opposed to stopping at carbon capture and sequestration. This proposal outlines an alternative route to carbon dioxide utilisation (CDU), in which a mediated approach that decouples the electrochemical reduction from the catalytic process is explored. Novel bimetallic catalysts will be synthesised and studied, meditating electron donating solutions will be generated, and a robust and comprehensive analytical arrangement will be implemented to allow total identification and quantification of the wide range of possible products. 
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the key approaches to CDU, as it has a direct pathway to carbon neutral renewable electricity. Nonetheless it is a field that has shown minimal progress in the past 30 years. A paradigm shift is necessary in the approach to electrochemical CO2 reduction, where conventional heterogeneous interfacial catalysis is limited by mass transport, passivation, and CO2 solubility. This proposal outlines the use of electron donating mediators generated separately to the catalysed chemical reduction of CO2, such that the electrolyte becomes the electrode. This opens a whole new avenue for catalyst research, and here target bimetallic catalysts that suppress side reactions and promote high value product synthesis are described.",2018-10-01,2023-09-30,1499994.0,,['carbon capture and sequestration'],1,1

Thus, much research has been devoted into increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCE), currently ~10% by optimising material properties at the different steps involved in the conversion of light into charge. There is evidence that charge delocalization and hot charge transfer (CT) states facilitate charge separation at the electron donor/acceptor interface. State-of-the-art OPVs already exhibit very high (>90%) internal quantum efficiencies (IQE). However, PCE relies not only on high IQE but also on minimizing energy loses (e.g. exciton relaxation) and avoiding charge recombination. A possible strategy to increase PCE is to find ways to optimise charge separation that allow simultaneously for high quantum efficiencies and architectures with longer exciton diffusion lengths or lower charge recombination rates. In QuESt we will investigate how to enhance OPV functionality by the emerging approach of modifying material properties through the hybridization of matter and photon states under strong light matter coupling. In particular, the aim of this project is to modify charge separation and eventually PCE in OPVs by engineering strong coupling between IR molecular vibrations and an optical cavity mode. We will develop a theoretical framework to describe the energy structure and charge dynamics in OPVs under strong vibrational coupling that will be benchmarked with non-linear spectroscopy experiments.",2018-09-01,2022-04-21,262269.0,,['solar cell'],1,1

However, seagrass meadows are affected by global climate change and anthropogenic stressors such as eutrophication and coastal development. Yet, the mechanistic interactions between these ecosystems and environmental change remain unclear due to the complexity of studying the seagrass habitat, which exhibit a multitude of chemical gradients and dynamics. The requirement for high-resolution measurement techniques for resolving the biogeochemical dynamics and microenvironments surrounding seagrasses in their natural habitat has led to the development of a variety of chemical techniques typically quantifying a single analyte at a time, which gives limited insight to the true dynamics of the seagrass-sediment interaction which is central for seagrass fitness and survival under environmental change. The SIPODET project will develop new multi-parameter chemical imaging techniques by combining luminescence-based optical sensor foils (planar optodes) with diffusional equilibrium in thin-film (DET) enabling simultaneous sensing of pO2, iron, phosphate, nitrite/nitrate, ammonium, manganese, pCO2 and pH. This project will encompass expert training of Dr. Cesbron in the use of planar optodes complementing his expertise in 2D DET mapping of chemical species, which will enable the development of a novel combined chemical imaging technology mentored by a world leader in microenvironmental analysis.

Since â‰ˆ 20% of the EU electrical energy is used for lighting, more efficient lighting concepts need to be developed. At present, inorganic light emitting diodes (LEDs) stand out as the best alternative to conventional lighting devices. In future, organic LEDs (OLEDs) are predicted to become the ultimate solution, since they allow fabrication of large-area flat and flexible devices; consequently, white-emitting OLEDs (WOLEDs) are actively investigated. Current WOLEDs require the use of multiple luminophores in a single device, but this leads to imbalanced white-light emission and colour instability, due to the different stability over time of each single emitter. Moreover, the incorporation of multiple emitters increases manufacturing costs. To overcome these drawbacks, attempts have been made to generate white-emission from a single multifunctional material. However, strong limitations were faced due to the complex synthetic procedures and the inability to control the excited-state properties of the emitter and its internal energy-transfer processes. In this scenario, we propose a new strategy for easy-to-synthesize binuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, displaying dual-emission for white-light generation from a single molecular entity. The strategy involves simultaneous generation of blue and orange emission from two electronically uncoupled Ir(III) centres, linked together by a non-conjugated bridging unit. This ambitious goal can be achieved due to the mutual interaction between the Experienced Researcher (ER) and the Host Institution (HI). While the ER has a strong background in the synthesis of luminescent complexes, the HI has a consolidated expertise in organic synthesis, theoretical and experimental photophysics, and in fabrication and testing of OLED devices.

Such is the requirement in farms, nurseries, greenhouses and vineyards, where movement space for vehicles is confined, the crop sensitive to green-house emissions and high towing capacity is necessary. The most important component to contribute to torque and speed is the transmission system (transaxle). Current transaxles fitted on electric vehicles are less efficient, have a cumbersome design, consume more electrical energy, have reduced battery operational time and are more expensive, thereby costing farmers up to 50% more in operational expenses.

We will combine the best technologies in mechanical gear ratios, mechanical differential locking and transaxle modularisation, to produce a novel design that will completely revolutionise transaxles for the agricultural electric vehicle sector. The high efficiency of the transmission will allow for enhanced vehicle autonomy with higher load capacity and longer battery life expectancy on a single charge. The application of TX3 is expected to have ripple benefits across Europe and globally, maximising the productive running time, thereby increasing productivity for farmers.

TÃ©rburkolatfejlesztÅ‘ Kft. We are an enthusiastic team of professionals with engineering and sales/marketing background.
With our flagship project PLATIO, an unconventional primarily outdoor energy producing paving system our mission is to
offer a viable solution to harvest and exploit renewable energy in urban environments.
Our project gained serious awareness and managed to involve venture capital from angel investors to create the prototypes
of our pavement system. We are also a mentored project within Design Terminal, a leading technological and startup mentor
program in Hungary.
PLATIO is an unconventional, a primarily outdoor energy producing paving system and an alternate to usual pavements.
Contrary to most of the applied pavements nowadays, PLATIO does not take material (such as stone, gravel, cement and
wood) and energy from nature to build human environment, but uses the normally appearing garbage and energy.
Consequently PLATIO is a paving platform made of recycled plastic. The planned product integrates different types of
environmental friendly technologies such as solar panels to use the solar power and kinetic energy converters to transform
the energy of human steps or any other means of vibration. The units are compact and modularly connect together making
electronic contact without additional wiring by a powerline communication system which connects automatically during the
establishment.
Combining recycled plastic, solar panels and piezoelectric kinetic energy converters we created the PLATIO technology that
can be used for several scenarios from household (B2C) to B2B solutions, such as smart advertisement providers. Instead
of trying to create the cheapest consumer solution we had learned from the market that",2017-01-01,2017-04-30,50000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

It will bring about orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, performance, reliability, security, and productivity in the design and programming of Systems of Artificial Intelligence that incorporate Smart Cyber Physical Systems while solving a chicken-egg problem for organizations who lack access to Data and Models. Itâ€™s open software architecture will facilitate adoption of the whole concept on a wider scale. 

It aims to address one of the most significant trends in the Internet of Things which is the shifting balance between edge computing and cloud computing. The early days of the IoT have been characterized by the critical role of cloud platforms as application enablers. Intelligent systems have largely relied on the cloud level for their intelligence, and the actual devices of which they consist have been relatively unsophisticated. This old premise is currently being shaken up, as the computing capabilities on the edge level advance faster than those of the cloud level. This paradigm shiftâ€”from the connected device paradigm to the intelligent device paradigm opens up numerous opportunities.

obvious possibility to counter this trend is to us the same energy for cooling that contributes to the cooling demand â€“ solar
energy.

The objective of the SOcool Project is to use a concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPVT) system combined with chillers to
provide the most cost-efficient solar energy on the market in form of electricity, heat and cold. This shall help achieving the
2K target while enhancing the living standard in rather hot climates.

The SunOyster is a concentrating solar technology which can generate at the same time electricity and heat with a very high
efficiency. From serial production, this will result in very low electricity and heat costs. While the electricity can easily be
converted into other forms of energy and can be fed into the grid, the heat is more difficult to convert and has to be used
locally. A technically, micro-economically and macro-economically very good form of using the heat in hot climates is
converting it into cold for the cooling of buildings.

Besides realizing a novel phase of matter, these materials can be exploited for many applications like in spintronics, and can serve as a platform to realize even more exotic phases like topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this project, we combine the input of very recent experimental breakthroughs with theoretical guidance to propose realistic setups to characterize and manipulate these phases. 

First, we will study novel platforms for the realization and manipulation of Majorana fermions. We will study how elemental Bismuth, a trivial and well studied semimetal, may host them in vortices when interfaced with a superconductor. We will then evaluate how to manipulate them when they are coupled in a vortex lattice, proposing the use of vortex dislocations as the carriers of unpaired modes. Then we will propose topological insulator edges as platforms to study fractionalized Majorana zero modes, known as parafermions. We will analyze current experiments in strongly interacting InAs/GaSb quantum wells, evaluating the feasibility of a fractional Josephson effect. We will also propose the edges of two dimensional topological crystalline insulators such as SnTe as candidates for the formation of a fractionalized helical liquid resembling fractional quantum Hall edges.

L-fucose is a rare monosaccharide with limited natural availability and a precursor of complex carbohydrates, as Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs, which are highly abundant in human milk but not in infant formula, have been recently recognised as natural molecules with high potential for nutritional and biomedical applications. Despite the increasing market demand of these â€œspecialty carbohydratesâ€, a large scale production of HMOs is currently not feasible.

In order to obtain better performance than what is currently possible with synthetic polyurethane compounds treated with other materials, we will use specific nano-materials for improving the mechanical and hydrophobic properties that the new finishing products impart to treated leather.
Another important effect of our project will be a major improvement in work conditions at the factories where leather is finished.
The goal of our project is to replace 30% of the presently petroleum based substances (approx. 10,000 tons) with chemicals of natural origin that have a low environmental impact and can improve the properties of the leather. 1.5 tons of petroleum are required for producing one ton of synthetic resins: our project will thus have the effect of reducing the consumption of petroleum in Europe by around 15 thousand tons.
Overall, our project will have the potential of the following environmental benefits on the European level:
1) up to a 30% decrease (equivalent to 10 thousand-ton) in the amount of synthetic, potentially pollution substances used in the tanning processes;
2) up to a 30% reduction (equivalent to 15 thousand-ton) in petroleum consumption, in the tanning process;
3) a significant improvement in the work environment of approx. 35,000 persons.",2016-03-01,2016-06-30,50000.0,,['biopolymer'],1,1

The off-grid household product is on track to become the most affordable and environmentally friendly method of distilling water from any source. We believe Desolenator can make a major contribution to global drinking water shortages. 
Our team have developed and patented the core enabling technology behind the system â€œthe desalination engineâ€.  Our product development strategy involves developing different product variants of this core desalination engine (i.e. a premium product, a low cost unit, a community scale unit and niche market units) so that we can meet the needs of different global markets.  At present, Desolenator do not clearly understand the market definition and user requirements in Southern Europe, and this is the focus of the enclosed Phase 1 Feasibility Study. 

We will work with market research experts to complete this project. The first stage of this plan will involve completing detailed research of market dynamics, water supply and regulatory issues in water stressed Southern European states (Malta & Cyprus). We will then work to identify our customers and understand their needs and purchasing requirements. Finally we will use our results to partner with relevant organisations. 

Desolenator can substantially improve the quality of life for European citizens suffering from water stress & contamination issues. Our technology can provide new water supply options to those in need, and completing this project will enable us to reduce stress on aquifers/reservoirs, reduce user anxiety during summer months and decrease dependence on imports.

1393,706094,TONSOPS,Titanium Oxide Nanocomposites for Scalable Optimized Perovskite Solar cells,"The European commission recognizes the importance of nanotechnology, semiconductors and advanced materials as key enabling technologies. The application of functional nanostructured materials in industrial processes and advanced science is of capital and strategic importance for the European economy and society. Their inclusion as reliable, standard and affordable components will boost the competitiveness of European industry, specifically in the fabrication of 4th generation solar cells. Sensitized Perovskites Solar cells (PSC) represent advantages in terms of cost manufacturing, energy generation and integration in flexible and semitransparent devices. However, the viability of their mass scale fabrication is hindered by economic and technical difficulties. Some of these technical issues arise from inefficient infiltration of the perovskite absorber into a fragile mesoporous (mp) TiO2 layer. My project addresses these problems applying a recently developed straightforward method for secure TiO2 nanotube layers (TNL) to commodity thermoplastic polymers. This novel method combined with optimized solution synthesized perovskites will result in the production of flexible and pliable PSC. Specifically, I propose to produce a step change in the standardization and fabrication of functional nanostructured materials, and its implementation in optimized PSCs. Lastly, the study on the life cycle management and viability of the industrial production of these PSC will be evaluated in an innovative photovoltaic manufacture company, ONYX SOLAR. Hence, the project is designed to generate disruptive, but easily scalable technology that may be rapidly adopted by European industry to boost its competitiveness in functional nanostructured composites and 4th generation solar cells.",2016-03-16,2018-03-15,170121.6,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

Off-grid communities in these regions rely on mobile phones for communication and to access essential services such as money transfer, healthcare. Without viable renewable alternatives, off-grid power in developing regions is currently provided through highly unsustainable fossil fuelled methods, and internet connectivity is exceptionally limited. This creates a significant business opportunity for providing reliable, clean and affordable charging for mobile phones and internet access. BuffaloGrid has developed a unique solar power based Hub system and a patent-pending remote payment control mechanism by which mobile phones (or other devices) can be charged under the control of a central server to ensure accountability, transparency and market insights. By combining renewable power and internet connectivity, BuffaloGrid enables EU companies to deliver essential internet-based services (e.g., e-health, e-education, e-governance etc) in developing regions. BuffaloGrid supplies Hubs free to local agents, offering them opportunities to provide mobile charging and internet access to their local communities. This will stimulate local enterprise, encourage entrepreneurship and boost economic development. BuffaloGridâ€™s unique model of providing the Hub for free, and unlocking access to power, allows demand to be met without charging high fees. Powered by solar energy, BuffaloGrid Hubs are emission-free during use and BuffaloGrid will take back Hubs for upgrade/ remanufacture/recycling at EoL (End-of-Life).

Without this information crisis management plans for health threats, floods, collapses or calamities are hard to execute. Plans for water management (scarcity of water resources), next generation emergency services (fire brigades), rainwater drainage challenges (enlarging urban environments) or strategic use of sensor systems to detect gas, drugs or explosives are essential and complex tasks. 
As Europe is urging to solve the issues mentioned above (Groundwater directive, Urban Drainage, Water Framework directive), local governments are looking into this matter. Compiling all the data concerning the exact location and structural status of complete sewerage facilities is expensive and very time consuming. Additionally, all inventory jobs are done manually, error prone & inaccurate, dangerous and operator bound. 
SEGU offers a solution to the European challenge by allowing for accurate digital 3D data that can be obtained 4 times faster, less expensive and safer. The aim of the SEGU (SEwer inventory system to safeGUard waste water infrastructures) project is to ensure market introduction of a Waste Water Infrastructure Data Service within EU28 as well as proper management of waste water infrastructure.

LED lighting for the service sector is only partly supported by current EU legislation, however further developments are ongoing. At national level in the different EU-Member States good pilot initiatives for efficient LED-systems in the services sector already have been implemented. However the number of implementations is still limited and a broad market penetration has not yet been achieved. National and local policies supporting efficient LED technology are largely missing.

Platinum Group Materials (PGMs), contained in this list, are among the least abundant of the Earth's elements and were classified as materials whose substitution is currently extremely difficult and recycling rate is very low. The supply of PGMs (Europe is the main importer) is currently ensured mostly by primary sources (72%) coming from both mines and recycled products (no mines in Europe), and it cannot meet the global demand (current deficit 20 tonnes). PGMs demand (up to 80%) is driven mainly by the emission control catalysts market which is expected to reach â‚¬6 billion by 2019.
The PROMETHEUS project will bring to the market a disruptive innovation, allowing for the first time to substitute up to 60% of PGMs used in autocatalysts with copper nanoparticles, while keeping the same performances and durability. Specifically the PROMETHEUS project objectives are:
1. Industrialising PROMETHEUS production and demonstrate on large scale its performances. PROMETHEUS has already been validated in the real environment with a key stakeholder (FIAT, Large multinational automotive industry) also supporting Phase 2;
2. Substituting 60% of PGMs used in autocatalysts with copper nanoparticles, saving up to 40 tonnes of PGMs per year, 2 times the current global deficit;
3. Decoupling Europe from a Critical Raw Material (PGMs), saving up to 60% of PGMs European demand per year (20 tonnes per year â€“ the current global demand/supply deficit);
4. Boosting European automotive and emission control catalyst markets. Copper costs ~6,800 times less than Platinum (4.5â‚¬/Kg against 30,550 â‚¬/Kg) which means that European industries can save almost â‚¬250 mln to be reinvested in RD&I and job growth.

The innovation project objective is a complete robotic inspection and cleaning system that will clean glass surfaces autonomously and reduce the cost of generating solar energy.
Solar electricity offers a clean alternative to carbon based energy sources, but its global uptake has been limited due to the comparatively high cost of energy generation. Although the cost of generation is consistently reducing through advances in manufacturing and panel efficiencies, operational costs continue to play a major role in preventing solar power plants from reaching true market competitiveness and contribute to their continued need for government subsidy.
Large scale solar installations comprise vast areas of panel surface which are subject to atmospheric and biological deposits. These deposits can reduce the generation efficiency of the solar power plant by up to 30%. 
Current methods for cleaning and maintaining solar panels rely on significant amounts of labour sometimes operating in inhospitable environments, which can account for more than 20% of annual O&M costs for a plant and in some areas of the planet are becoming more of a problem with the increase of dust owing to the changing climate. This is especially true for the growing CSP market which is highly sensitive to even minor reductions to irradiation levels.

This will be implemented by using an isothermal, scroll type expander that will replace the conventional (close to) isentropic one that is exclusively included in conventional ORC engines. This configuration can lead to much higher cycle thermal efficiency than the existing ORC units.
The development of such isothermal expander makes it feasible to reach much higher efficiency than that of a conventional ORC, which is up to now the most common technology of heat conversion (e.g. biomass, industrial waste, geothermal and solar energy) into electricity. A first prototype has been designed, manufactured and tested, revealing the potential of this technology. Further work is required to validate and improve this concept and up-scale the expander to 20 kW rated power, with the aim to conclude to a commercial product.

In particular, water is used as a cleaning source, conveyor of raw materials and cooling agent for quickly perishable commodities. Recently, the food industry is facing increasing pressure to ensure company activities follow environmentally sound protocols, but there is also pressure to increase profitability against competition. A primary concern of the food-industry is consumer safety. The use of alternative control means other than chemicals to reduce water microbial contamination and postharvest decay of fruit and vegetables is becoming increasingly important to enhance food safety and minimise residue levels in fresh produce while preserving water. Although water will always be an integral part of food processing, environmentally sound technologies for pollution prevention and water preservation have potential for cost-effective resource reduction practices.

We have developed an innovative technology, biowater, for sustainable food processing and sanitation. The patented biowater process combines environmentally sound technologies for treatment, sanitation and recycling of wash water for postharvest fruit and vegetable processing.

1404,690724,SOPRANO,Soot Processes and Radiation in Aeronautical inNOvative combustors,"For decades, most of the aviation research activities have been focused on the reduction of noise and NOx and CO2 emissions. However, emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines of non-volatile PM, consisting primarily of soot particles, are of international concern today. Despite the lack of knowledge toward soot formation processes and characterization in terms of mass and size, engine manufacturers have now to deal with both gas and particles emissions. Furthermore, heat transfer understanding, that is also influenced by soot radiation, is an important matter for the improvement of the combustorâ€™s durability, as the key point when dealing with low-emissions combustor architectures is to adjust the air flow split between the injection system and the combustorâ€™s walls. The SOPRANO initiative consequently aims at providing new elements of knowledge, analysis and improved design tools, opening the way to:
â€¢ Alternative designs of combustion systems for future aircrafts that will enter into service after 2025 capable of simultaneously reducing gaseous pollutants and particles, 
â€¢ Improved liner lifetime assessment methods.
Therefore, the SOPRANO project will deliver more accurate experimental and numerical methodologies for predicting the soot emissions in academic or semi-technical combustion systems. This will contribute to enhance the comprehension of soot particles formation and their impact on heat transfer through radiation. In parallel, the durability of cooling liner materials, related to the walls air flow rate, will be addressed by heat transfer measurements and predictions. Finally, the expected contribution of SOPRANO is to apply these developments in order to determine the main promising concepts, in the framework of current low-NOx technologies, able to control the emitted soot particles in terms of mass and size over a large range of operating conditions without compromising combustorâ€™s liner durability and performance toward NOx emissions.",2016-09-01,2020-08-31,6829310.0,,['gas turbine'],1,1
1405,689074,HOLISHIP,HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life cycle,"Most maritime products are typically associated with large investments and are seldom built in large series. Where other modes of transport benefit from the economy of series production, this is not the case for maritime products which are typically designed to refined customer requirements increasingly determined by the need for high efficiency, flexibility and low environmental impact at a competitive price. Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).
One of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. 
Advanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions. This calls for greatly improved design tools including multi-objective optimisation and finally virtual testing of the overall design and its components.
HOLISHIP (HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life-cycle) addresses these urgent industry needs by the development of innovative design methodologies, integrating design requirements (technical constraints, performance indicators, life-cycle cost, environmental impact) at an early design stage and for the entire life-cycle in an integrated design environment.

The European primary production remains below a few percentage. However, resources exist in Europe, as primary resources but mainly as secondary resources (industrial waste, urban mines). Valorizing these resources requires coordination and networking between researchers, entrepreneurs and public authorities to harmonise technologies, processes and services, develop standards, create new potential for export of eco-innovative solutions and for seizing new markets
MSP-REFRAM will address these challenges by creating of a common multi-stakeholder platform that will draw the current refractory metals value chains and identify its innovation potential in order to support the implementation of the EIP on Raw Materials. Coming from industry, research, public sectors and civil society, both Consortium Members and External Experts have joined forces with expertise covering the whole value chain including mining, processing, recycling, application.
The outputs of MSP-REFRAM will help Europe improve the supply value chain of refractory metals in the coming years, optimising the use of external resources as energy and water and at the same time reducing the amount and the toxicity of waste.
MSP-REFRAM will share its conclusions widely and efficiently, in a long lasting way thanks to the support of the PROMETIA association. To ensure the systemic change, the outcomes of the project will be made available to the stakeholders and to the public through different tools and reports.
In the medium term, MSP-REFRAM will contribute to better-informed decision-making at EU and national level as well as industry by proposing innovative value chains that will boost the refractory metals sector. In the longer term, this should improve the availability of these refractory metals, while creating greater added value to the economy and more jobs.",2015-12-01,2017-06-30,1499760.0,,['recycling'],1,1
1411,718397,HASNEH,Effective Bio-based Flame Retardants for Consumer Electronics and Automotive Applications,"Flame retardants are additives that are added to plastics to slow down fires, saving lives. It is estimated that flame retardants have reduced the number of fire deaths by 20% in the past 20 years, despite the considerable increase in the number of electronic devices in homes.

However, these flame retardants have traditionally been based on chlorinated and brominated substances that have negative impacts on human health and the environment and have subsequently been banned for electronic applications in Europe. 

Green alternatives that have been put forward are either expensive, compromise the mechanical properties of the plastics produced or have poor flame retardant performance. This has also meant that the market penetration of bioplastics has been limited, partiocualrly in the automobile and consumer electronics markets, as there is no cost effective, high performance, green flame retardant that maintains mechanical properties in the market.

As part of an EU financed project, BRIGIT, Daren Laboratories & Scientific Consultants Ltd has synthetized a series of novel and effective FR bio-additive (LS-FR) using modified lignosulfonate, a by-product of the acid digestion of wood in the chemical pulping industry. LS-FR has been validated in durable bioplastics: polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) and polybutylene succinate (PBS).

LS-FR is an effective and bio-based FR which offers for the first time, the possibility of an FR bioplastic which meets the FRs standards for the consumer electronics and automobile sectors, while maintaining adequate mechanical properties. Daren Labs aims to use the SME instrument to scale up the production of LS-FR and bring it to the automotive and consumer electronics market, generating estimated revenues in 2021 of over 4Mâ‚¬ with a ROI on project costs of 290%.",2016-03-01,2016-08-31,50000.0,,['bioplastic'],1,1

It transforms thermal energy (80Â°C - 400Â°C) from different heat sources on demand either in mechanical, electrical energy or higher/lower temperature levels. The working principle is: Due to a waste heat supply a working medium expands against a working fluid and against the Energy Converting Unit that works as a hydraulic engine to generate different kind of energy forms. Heat2Energy achieves much higher overall efficiencies of >20% than conventional technologies like ORC. The users can be found world-wide, where ever thermal processes happen. They are either application-specific end users (private, public organisations, individuals), components manufacturers for integration in their own products/processes or system manufacturers. Depending on the heat source advent, the potential markets are: Industry (waste heat recovery; efficiency increase of existing power plants), Home (energy efficiency increase of buildings), Renewables (solar thermal, biomass, geothermal) and Mobility (energy-efficient drives for ships, locomotives and trucks). The commercial potential to recover the industrial waste heat in Europe is estimated at 2,000 PJ/a. In Germany, the market value of waste heat recovery exceeds â‚¬25 Billion/a. It is a growing high volume market as applications are so manifold across many sectors. The economic benefits are substantial energy cost savings, reduction of GHG emissions and the possibility of operating energy-autonomous applications. The technology significantly contributes to the sustainable use of natural resources and to secure and decarbonise the European energy system including the integration of renewables. The feasibility assessment shall prepare the demonstration of the technology in the cement industry to provide mechanical drive for the screw-type compressor to generate compressed air, to elaborate the business plan and to finally promote the technology.",2015-05-01,2015-09-30,50000.0,,['geothermal'],1,1

The MF45 System will be capable to convert the equivalent of 45% of the direct sun light into clean electricity at costs equivalent to those of conventional sources (CO2 intensive). This represents conversion efficiency increases of 30% and 60% relative to other commercial CPV systems and FP systems, respectively. 
As result of the SOLARGE45 project, LPI aims to become a worldwide reference manufacturer and supplier of a novel CPV System able to generate profits in large-scale utility solar plants, and without the support of government policies backing up clean electricity. This will bring a positive impact in the challenge stressed in the 'Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy' Work Programme: low-cost, low carbon electricity supply.
Through the Phase 1 of the SME Instrument LPI will be able to assess the industrial and commercial feasibility of the business innovation project proposed for introducing the MF45 System into the market. The specific objectives that must be achieved in the course of the Feasibility Study are the following:
- To define the MF45 System specifications needed to assure long-term-performance under real operation conditions to guarantee product bankability and standard certification
- To assess different product-development and industrial process pilot plant alternatives with optimal quality within cost and reliability balance 
- To identify the specific operational and financial resources and/or partners to cover the whole MF45 System manufacturing and commercialisation

They enable household monitoring and appliance control with several new HW and SW solutions and extensive manuals, but do not automatically adapt to the userâ€™s living habits. Moreover, studies showed that smart home schedules set by the users are widely inefficient thus contributing to excessive energy usage. Initial tests show that up to 33% of energy saving can be achieved with our innovative approach.
The presented product tries to breach the gap between the users and a truly smart home by introducing an on-demand cloud service that implements multi-criteria optimization and dynamic user profiling methods in order to optimize performance in any smart building and in particular connected into a smart city. Moreover, the user can only qualitatively set a couple of parameters and then select one of the control strategies proposed by the system, dealing with balance of energy preserving, comfort and security. Optimization methods achieve even higher energy savings with alternative energy sources, e.g., photovoltaic energy. The technological feasibility of the project was already verified on a small house prototype.
The market potential for the presented service is extremely high, with the revenue growth estimated to reach $51.77 billion by 2020, at an estimated CAGR of 29.5%. Several key players like Google are entering the market indicating another global dominance. We are in contact with several global  market providers to speed-up the commercialization of our product.

The solution is provided by sensor units installed at crane boom tips and dedicated software to process the data collected by these sensor units, where the concept is called the OptiLift framework. It includes three major tools, namely the logistics, human detection and crane control, to perform the improvements listed before.
 
The framework is significantly innovative both application and technology wise. Currently, there exists no unified solution in the market allowing extended weather windows, increased safety for offshore personnel / cargo, and improved logistic planning. Optilift framework will be first to address these industry-needs with a cost efficient and scalable application. The framework utilizes a patent pending sensor unit and cutting-edge computer-vision library to perform cargo / vessel / human detection, tracking and machine automation tasks that no other institution or company performed before.
The primary users of the framework will be the operators of offshore installations. Initially, we expect the technology to be utilized by oil and gas companies. Later, expansion into the offshore windmill farms market is envisaged.

The proposed synergetic approach results with a sustainable system, taking full advantage of alternative fuels value to produce regulated electrical power as well as domestic heating, at overall energy efficiency above 90%.
To enable a cost effective application, the embedded electricity generating unit must be highly reliable and maintenance free, thus a thermoacoustically based solution is expected to be the ideal solution.
Qnergy has recently demonstrated 1 kW solar thermoacoustic application. However, the optimal configuration and combined system spec must be refined for best market acceptance, according to consumerâ€™s needs and budget limitations. In common situations, a typical user will experience an ROI of less than two years; though specific government policies may lead to different optimal power capacities, as net metering allows using an oversized alternator and feedback the grid in excessive electricity. 
Thus our planned feasibility assessment will include a thorough business plan, focusing on market needs, time to market, and identifying the main customers and competitors; resulting in a measurable product specification and detailed risk management plan. 
Additionally, the key factors affecting overall system performance will be identified according to the thermo-acoustic-electrical simulation and the detailed design model. Moreover, a full freedom to operate IP survey will be performed, while the product cost, manufacturing technologies and its limitations will be covered.

1434,663811,BilletPro,"Development of a harvesting machine for short rotation plantations for the production of billets with advantageous properties in terms of handling, drying and storing","Plantations of fast-growing trees, so-called short rotation plantations (SRPs), are a promising way to produce large amounts of CO2 neutral energy. SRPs are usually harvested fully automatically with harvesting machines that directly chop the wood into chips which are then combusted in CHP plants. However, the chipping leads to losses of up to 30 % of the energy content due to microbial degradation of the wood during drying.
SalixEnergi Europa AB has developed an innovative new harvesting technology which enables a fast drying of the wood without any losses of the energy content. The rods are cut into pieces with a length between 12 and 24 cm (depending on the purpose), so-called billets. When stored in piles the good air circulation enables a fast drying while the bark protects the billets from microbial degradation. A first technical prototype has demonstrated the proper functioning and huge potentials of the technology. However, improvements and adaptations are required to achieve the market breakthrough. In this proposed project a feasibility study will reveal the technical feasibility of the envisaged improvements and the optimal way of implementation, while a business plan will show the optimal way of commercialisation.
The billet harvester will allow European energy farmers to use the full energetic potential of the wood and thus increase their income by up to 30 %, while the increased production of CO2 neutral energy per unit of area will help Europe to reach its goals of climate control. The improved profitability of SRPs will moreover lead to a further fast growth of the plantation area. At the same time SalixEnergi Europa AB will significantly grow in terms of turnover, profit and employment, reach the market leadership for SRP harvesters and expand its position as one of Europeâ€™s leading SRP companies.",2015-03-01,2015-08-31,50000.0,,['CHP'],1,1

We have developed a new manufacturing process and associated machinery enabling production of the emerging segmented motors, where stators and rotors are composed by modules (segments). Compared to traditional motors the segmented ones are: 
â€¢ cheaper, because use of raw materials is more efficient and assembly is simplified,
â€¢ greener, because waste material during production is massively reduced,
â€¢ high-performance, thanks to optimization of electrical phenomena.

The segmented motors, whose production is enabled by SPARK, meet the needs of motors manufacturers for reduction of waste material in production, due to cost and environmental concerns. 

SPARK strongly supports the EC Societal Challenges for clean, efficient energy, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials. Segmented motors, in fact, reduce wastes and therefore energy, CO2 and pollution for material recycling and re-processing.

The feasibility assessment will focus on the production process and machinery; the goal is twofold: the technical feasibility (to assess what are the necessary developments to be carried out and including an IP regime analysis) and the economic viability (a detailed Business Plan will be built around the 9 classic blocks of Canvas). This would allow to consider the additional funding that will be needed, with a possibility to further develop the concept through a Phase 2 project.

Overcoming the technical barriers in manufacturing these motors, implementing an advanced manufacturing process and introducing the related machinery in our product portfolio by end of 2017 is our major objective. If we succeed in developing this, we would be the only company providing this solution, anticipating competitors, penetrating the market and achieving high market shares.

However, current commercial solutions achieve these benefits only in a limited way, and in most of the cases are far away of being attractive for the decision makers (local authorities), which prefer to invest in other proven/mature solutions to reduce CO2 emissions and regulate traffic. Market penetration of on-street smart parking solutions until 2020 is estimated at 1% for a market of around 18 million regulated parking spaces all around Europe, but the potential market is huge if we take into account that 190 million on-street parked spaces could be potentially regulated.

Current solutions available in the market have a parking space accuracy detection of up to 95%, and do not have vehicle identification capabilities. These two features makes impossible to deploy specific solutions for on-street parking spaces that permits a reliable urban traffic management, like occupancy forecasting, fraud control (automatic enforcement), variable pricing, driver guidance, and improved user experience (recommendations and automatic billing). 

FASTPRK-2 will overcome these limitations by delivering a cost affordable robust and reliable 100% accuracy detection with vehicle identification, as well as demanding advance tools and services for on-street parking space management.

Industry development
The composite industry is a fast growing and widely expanding industry. The majority of all commercial composite product are based on thermosets. Thermosets can not be separated in the original fiber and matrix materials. Hence reuse or recycling is hardly possible. Within a few years the lack of recyclability imposes an undesired situation. 
Problem
Mass production is required to server high volume commodity products and markets. Mass production require advanced automated production processes which requires thermoplastic tapes as semi-finished product. Current thermoplastic tapes are of limited quality, hampering the shift towards increased recyclability.
Intended Innovation
Years of involvement in the industry and the development of thermoplastic unidirectional tapes production processes resulted in an improved production method. The production method is based on an industry knowledge cross-over. The realization of a full scale mass production facility will be realized with an incumbent textile manufacturer, by means of a joint venture. 
Benefit
Once commercial available, the innovation contributes to a increased recyclability of new composite products. The use of high quality thermoplastic tapes will reduce weight in several products of high volume markets. The realized weight reduction of the products will result in a decrease of CO2 emission during the transportation and during the lifetime of products. 
Effect
The innovation bridges the gab between, low cost medium quality raw materials and advanced automated production processes.

Since 2007 we have been working to develop a novel green heat recovery system for professional laundry systems (ReHeat) by applying the heat pump water condensed dryer principle.
Professional laundry equipment is energy intensive: 66 billion kWh/year or 78% of all laundry electricity consumption. Many inefficient products continue to be placed on the market, despite lower life cycle cost for products with higher efficiencies. If no specific measures are taken, the annual energy consumption of laundry equipment is predicted to increase 17% by 2030. As a result the EU is preparing new regulation (EU Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/E) to reduce the environmental impact of non-household laundry equipment. From TEKFRIGO, we are pre-empting the legislation with the development of ReHeat. Our first prototype recovers heat from the exhaust air reducing the energy consumption of a dryer by 25%-63% and generates hot clean water at 50Â°C that can be re-used by the washing machines leading to a reduction of electricity to heat water by 50%.

To implement new European legislation intended to eliminate this illegal trade, independent tools will be needed to verify the legal status of timber. We therefore propose to develop a fast, accurate and cost-effective commercial forensic tool, 'Timtrace', for tracing the claimed origin of tropical timber. Timtrace uses (1) ring-width measurements that can be matched with reference measurements or climate data, (2) stable isotopes in the wood that can be matched with regional reference data, and (3) DNA analyses that allow distinguishing timber obtained from different areas. The application of multiple methods greatly expands the number of tropical timbers whose origin can be traced. 

Our forensic approach is competitive, as unlike current commercial alternatives, it does not require access to the timber in the country of harvest. Potential customers of Timtrace include the customs and inspection authorities, the timber-processing industry and organisations that certify sustainable forest management. Several of these stakeholders have already shown interest in a commercially available and cost-effective forensic tool for timber tracing. 

Timtrace builds on the results and expertise obtained during the ERC-funded TROFOCLIM project in which we assembled databases with many thousands measurements of tree-rings and stable isotopes for 20 tropical timber varieties from three continents. Results of the TROFOCLIM project will be directly applied for tracing tropical timbers and will also serve as reference data. 

We will use the ERC Proof of Concept Grant to (1) develop a fast, accurate and cost-effective tool for forensic tracing of tropical timber and (2) evaluate its commercial feasibility.

For example energy vendor may be interested to limit some non-critical energy-consuming assets at the peak time (like air conditioning when nobody is at home) or maximize home-based PV installation capacity of its customer at the peak time. 
Thanks to that, the vendor is able to buy less energy in the wholesale market at the peak times. Yielding control over some consuming/producing assets brings value to vendors' final customers - they will be able to pay less for the energy (less consumption in peak times) and/or get better price for the green energy they produce at home and they will not need to pay any attention in order to achieve that. Moreover vendors will probably offer better tariffs to the customers connected to SmartX as the cost of supply-demand risk management for such  group of customers will be much cheaper.",2015-05-01,2015-09-30,50000.0,,['PV'],1,1

BIOT has coordinated two projects within the FP7 SME instrument programme to respond to the need of olive oil producers by offering an optimised biotechnological recycling solution for olive washing wastewater using photobioreactors (PBR).  The technical viability of the process in industrial end use conditions has been sufficiently demonstrated in these two past projects: algatec\ treats olive washing water efficiently so that treated water complies with wastewater legislation, and treated water can be reused.

The result is a warm, direct, sunlight and a surrounding sky light, completely transforming indoor spaces, giving them volume and shape through light and shadow, and which allows creating a new relationship between people and the surrounding architecture.
The next step of the companyâ€™s growth plan is to bring this pioneering product, which can be produced for a small niche of high-end users, to the industrial scale, thus satisfying the blossoming demand. This will be the focus of the CoeLux(VR) innovation project, which will deliver two new modular systems (SkyBlade and SkyCasket), amenable to large scale production. 
This will be achieved through 4 developmental stages: 1 Upscaling of the nanomaterial dispersion used to coat the diffusing panel which represents the companyâ€™s key and proprietary technology. 2. Upgrade of the LED source and the optical design, which allows incorporating a radically new LED system, exclusively designed for CoeLux. 3 Engineering, industrial design and packaging, which focusses around the customersâ€™ perception of the product, as well as its industrial manufacturing process. 4. Finally, the overarching ambition is to set-up the production supply chain, inspired by lean manufacturing principles, organizing the sourcing of the semi-finished products from the selected suppliers, and the internal production logistics in a standardized manufacturing plan, in view of the high-end positioning of the product.
The project results will allow CoeLux to ramp-up its operational capacity, also increasing the companyâ€™s preparedness to the global market through core assets as product certification, trademark, and IP protection, thus reaping the benefit of this revolutionising technology.",2015-05-01,2017-04-30,2179363.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,1
1450,674006,SafeTrain,Piloting and industrial validation of autonomous and sustainable animal deterring system for the rail transport,"At NEEL we have developed an absolute novelty on a world scale: UOZ-1 animal deterring system that successfully prevents the animal-train collisions. The device exploits an animal natural sensitivity to sound and just before a train approach, at the time of the danger, a series of sounds stimulates animal instinct and enforces their life defensive reflex reaction in the form of escape.
Our UOZ-1 animal deterring devise has been created in response to the particular need of preventing collisions of wild animals with trains in areas where the migration routes of animals cross the railway lines.
The primary objective of the SafeTrain Project is to pilot and test in real environment the autonomous system for the automatic train detection that will be integrated with our UOZ-2 animal deterring device. The new train location system will be based on an intelligent mechanism of listening for an approaching train commercially known as an â€œIndian earâ€. 
Our goal is to incorporate it into the animal deterring system in order to make it independent from the currently used rail signalling system. This will not only reduce the complexity of the whole system but also will reduce the investment and maintenance costs down to 60% of the todays costs. 
The secondary, but not less important goal is the development of green powering system for UOZ-2 utilising renewable energy sources to make the system energetically self-sustained. This will be of particular importance in areas where the rail track has not been electrified and thus with limited access to grid power. 
Our acoustic method for train-animal collisions prevention is an excellent solution that allows preservation of ecological corridors and animal migration routes and significantly reduces the safety and business risk of rail carriers.  It overcomes all limitations of the state-of the-art solutions available on the market, and looking at Europe only, opens the way to the market worth of nearly 125mâ‚¬.",2015-07-01,2017-06-30,1377250.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

The commercial applications for the ERC â€œNetSatâ€ project are three-fold: (1) communication (particularly in the machine to machine (M2M) context), (2) traffic management (e.g., for autonomous driving), and (3) earth observation (where larger numbers of small satellites offer higher temporal resolution). As space for the operation of small satellite formations is restricted and primarily US-based, VC-backed start-ups are already competing in the market (e.g., SpaceX, OneWeb), large-scale and timely investments are needed for the ZfT to select and implement the most appropriate business model to successfully compete in this market.

None of the competitors in the small satellite market seem to focus on providing M2M services, and they operate a constellation instead of a formation of satellites, i.e., the satellites are controlled individually from the ground, which makes formations not only technologically superior but also in line with the upcoming trend of connected devices. For timely commercialization, the ERC PoC Grant will provide the needed financial resources for securing IP and an evaluation of 4 potential business models - i.e., (1) a vendor-, (2) a licensing-, (3) a system provider- and (4) a data provider strategy, and the drafting of a business plan within 12 months for the most promising one(s) based on detailed data and analysis from a cross-disciplinary research team seeking to attract large-scale financial investments and corporate partners.'",2016-09-01,2017-08-31,149823.75,,['traffic management'],1,1

Existing solutions will struggle to cater as on-grid solutions are already unreliable or absent in rural areas and developing countries. Efficient new renewable energy solutions are needed in order to maximise world-wide electricity production, whilst meeting climate targets. In Europe alone, more than 26,400 suitable locations for mini (<1MW) hydropower generation remain unexploited, partly due to poor accessibility or unsuitability of existing mini-hydropower solutions. HYDROGO, our mobile, small, easy- and fast-to-install hydropower solution, is designed to alleviate the electricity needs of individuals or communities by producing electricity from river currents and waterfalls, efficiently, and in locations where existing solutions cannot. We have developed two models based on the same technology: Euro-pallet mounted Drop&Go and container-based Plug&Go to meet micro (<100 kW) and mini (<1MW) electricity demands, respectively. The HYDROGO plants can produce current effects up to 600 kW, meaning that Plug&Go could power up to 1,350 households/year. Practical and theoretical testing at the The Norwegian University of Science and Technology has allowed us to develop a HYDROGO prototype, which produces at least 20% more energy per waterfall height than existing hydropower technologies. HYDROGO requires only anchoring but no building work for its installation and is highly customisable to user needs, can be easily relocated, and set-up as a hybrid power station as well as connected to the grid. HYDROGO is not immersed in streams and therefore undisruptive to the environment, easy to maintain and move, if needed. Amongst its many potential applications, HYDROGO is the perfect solution for difficult to access areas and disaster zones where off-grid power is needed immediately. Our vision is to be the world leader in supplying small-scale hydropower plant solutions.",2018-11-01,2019-02-28,50000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

They are also a primary cause for traffic jams in most major cities. These vehicles are extremely harmful, not only to the environment, but also to the quality of life in cities. Air and noise pollution, road congestion and lack of space are problems seriously affecting big cities. 
Tretbox GmbH is introducing a new category of electric vehicle â€“ called ONO - which is not only better for cities, but also offers reduced operational costs for logistics operators and is designed for demand growth in todayâ€™s and tomorrow's cities: we replace the gasoline trucks with a combination of city depots and a new type of electric cargo bicycle. We allow operators flexibility in the capacity of the vehicle according to changing workloads. For the drivers, we offer the ergonomics, the comfort and safety they would hope for. 
ONO offers logistics market customers the option to switch from their existing combustion engine trucks to modern electric cargo bicycles. By doing so, they save money, time and gain flexibility while enhancing their brand perception. The logistics market is growing exponentially, yet still employing antiquated delivery methods not adapted to their needs.

Food, energy and water are the three critical resources that must be managed if mankind is going to thrive. With these figures, we will need a 70-100% increase of food supply to maintain the current nutrition levels. Greenhouse farming is a solution to the food worldwide demands as it can increase the food production per acre up to 100% compared to open field agriculture. Although the energy consumption by agriculture made up only 2.8 % of final energy consumption in the EU-281, the global leader in greenhouse production of horticultural products, The Netherlands, has the highest energy consumption in Europe (7.2 %), clearly showing the impact of Greenhouse farming on energy sources. 
On top of that, the world to which we are currently heading also deserves energetic sustainable solutions to satisfy the growing rate of electrification in the extended populated areas. The global primary energy demand could increase by 50% by the middle of the century. Nowadays, buildings account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption globally but it is estimated that potential energy savings in buildings could reach between 20% and 40% with new solutions. Solar panels enable energy savings; typically installed on the roof, they do not offer versatility for other type of application, such as windows to allow the entrance of the light inside buildings or greenhouses.
Our solution, PanePowerSW is the unique transparent (up to 70%) solar panel glass that generates clean energy through PV technology and more importantly allows the light to shine through greenhouses and commercial buildings windows.

Traffic management, road maintenance and planning new infrastructures are the 3 main factors to successfully contribute to the growing vehicles mobility needs. An opportunity arises in using smart traffic data to optimise long-term road management, allowing for a more efficient use of resources in infrastructure planning and maintenance. It is estimated that over $1 trillion can be saved in the next 20 years through a more efficient infrastructure productivity plan, of which 25% are related to road networks alone. SMApp is the first smart, standardised, web based tool to monitor, analyse and predict traffic data information in real time over a road network. Through our propietary LPR (License Plates Recognition) algorithm we will be able to obtain a truly global and continuous road network solution (currently being discreet over specific sections) by OD matrices, gaining access to a source of accurate, objective and valuable data in an unprecedented manner, to provide a more efficient planning and maintenance of the existing and future road networks.Since 2009, we have already invested â‚¬620K to develop SMApp to its current functional prototype stage, which is being tested by the Spanish National Traffic Authority (DGT) and proofing our Technology Readiness Level at 6.

1458,750252,StoiCa,Resilience of Soil Stoichiometry in subartic soils under Temperature-Induced Soil Carbon Losses: Where does the N go?,"Global warming can trigger enormous releases of carbon (C) from soils, with positive feedbacks to climate change. Northern high latitude soils can constitute a major contributor to this positive feedback loop. Climate change predictions are however still largely uncertain, partly due the lack of accurate representation of vegetation and soil microbial feedbacks and C and nitrogen (N) interactions. Warming enhances microbial mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) (i.e. soil C outputs) to a higher degree than vegetation productivity (i.e. soil C inputs), resulting in large C losses from northern soils. Pioneer results point to proportional N losses in response to warming, which may be the key to this phenomenon. This project will combine the expertise of a multidisciplinary group of leading researchers on ecosystem stoichiometry, stable N isotopic methods and applied biotechnology with the existence of unique and established research sites in geothermal systems in Iceland to reveal the fate of N lost in response to warming, and uncover the mechanisms behind observed soil C losses. StoiCa will elucidate, for first time, three key knowledge gaps: (1) the rates, forms and mechanisms of N losses from arctic soils under warming; (2) the transient- and persistent responses and the warming-induced transitions from a closed to a leaky, open N cycle; (3) the shifts towards a more symbiotic N cycle and role of thermo-adapted mycorrhiza in stimulating plant growth. This proposal directly addresses two cross-cutting priorities of sustainable development and climate action from the H2020 Work Programme.

1466,731456,certMILS,Compositional security certification for medium- to high-assurance COTS-based systems in environments with emerging threats,"certMILS develops a security certification methodology for Cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS are characterised by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. A common downside to CPS complexity and openness is a large attack surface and a high degree of dynamism that may lead to complex failures and irreparable physical damage. The legitimate fear of security or functional safety vulnerabilities in CPS results in arduous testing and certification processes. Once fielded, many CPS suffer from the motto: never change a running system.
certMILS increases the economic efficiency and European competitiveness of CPS development, while demonstrating the effectiveness of safety & security certification of composable systems.
The project employs a security-by-design concept originating from the avionics industry: Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS), which targets controlled information flow and resource usage amongst software applications. certMILS reduces certification complexity, promotes re-use, and enables secure updates to CPS throughout its life-cycle by providing certified separation of applications, i.e. if an application within a complex CPS fails or starts acting maliciously, other applications are unaffected.
Security certification of complex systems to medium-high assurance levels is not solved today. The existing monolithic approaches cannot cope with the complexity of modern CPS. certMILS uses ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 62443 to develop and applies a compositional security certification methodology to complex composable safety-critical systems operating in constantly evolving hostile environments. certMILS core results are standardised in a protection profile.certMILS develops three composable industrial CPS pilots (smart grid, railway, subway), certifies security of critical re-useable components, and ensures security certification for the pilots by certification labs in three EU countries with involvement of the authorities.",2017-01-01,2020-12-31,3999055.63,,['smart grid'],1,1
1467,727202,Cellulose recovery,High quality cellulose recovery from AHP: From used diaper to coatings additive,"Every year 7.5Mton of Absorbent Hygiene Product (AHP) waste is produced in Europe. This is disposed either by landfilling or incineration. AHP waste consists of disposable child nappies, adult incontinence products, feminine hygiene and similar products. Thereof, 30% corresponding to 2.25 Mton/year can be collected as mono-stream AHP waste. However, current state of the art does not offer an economically viable solution for the recovery of raw materials from this stream. The underlying reason is that existing technology strongly depends on waste disposal gate fees and produces cellulose with a purity of typically 70-75%, which is only suitable for low grade application, e.g.as cardboard.

The main objective of the innovation project is to provide a technical solution for the recycling of high grade cellulose from AHP waste. The patented process is based on dissolving lignin with mild acids, thus upgrading the overall cellulose purity. Based on this solution a total of 360 kton of cellulose per year with a high degree of purity (> 92%) can be produced from the AHP waste. This high quality cellulose that can be used as paint additive or as chemical building block, could result in an economically viable operation without depending on gate fees. The proposed valorisation of Psiconâ€™s process represents a potential total value increase for the European economy of up to 360 Mâ‚¬/year and 2,000 new jobs. The European environment strongly benefits as CO2 emission is reduced up to 700 kton/year and reducing resources consumption by reusing them.

The long term ambition of Psicon is to create enough production sites, at strategic locations close to the feedstock, in order to be able to convert 70-80% of the mono-stream AHP waste. This is a significant step towards near-zero AHP waste in Europe. In this feasibility assessment the final hurdles will be taken towards an EU wide market introduction supported by demonstrating the process of Psicon in an operational environment.",2016-05-01,2016-10-31,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,1
1468,689157,FORCE,Cities Cooperating for Circular Economy,"The overall objective is to minimise the leakage of materials from the linear economy and work towards a circular economy. Specific objectives are to: 
â€¢ Engage cities, enterprises, citizens and academia in 16 participatory value chain based partnerships to create and develop eco-innovative solutions together.
â€¢ Develop 10 viable end-markets by demonstrating new applications for plastic waste, metals (EEE devices), biowaste and wood waste.
â€¢ Develop a governance model for cities based on value chain based partnerships.
â€¢ Develop decision support tools and assess the actual impact by use of Big Data.
â€¢ Ensure replication through the FORCE Academy aiming at enterprises, citizens and policy makers.
The eco-innovative solutions will be demonstrated across four cities (Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lisbon and Genoa) and using the four materials: 
Flexible plastics: Recycling and upgrade of 5,000 tonnes of flexible plastic from enterprises and private households will enable virgin material substitution, corresponding to preventing emissions of 12,500 tonnes of CO2. 
Metals: Citizens will be mobilised to reclaim an additional 2 kg/capita of WEEE (app. 3,600 tonnes). A communication campaign will reach 100,000 citizens and support at least five SMEâ€™s that repair damaged EEE devices so that 10-20% of the collected WEEE can be redistributed. 
Wood waste: additional 12,000 tonnes wood waste from urban and mountain areas will be collected. 8-10,000 tonnes of brushwood will be used for compost production, and 14-16,000 tonnes will be processed into wood particles.
Biowaste: around 7,000 tonnes of biowaste from the municipal mixed waste stream will be recovered: 3,000 tonnes coming from restaurants and hotels, and 4,000 tonnes coming from households.

The partnerships will result in the creation of viable eco-innovative market solutions, exploited by the partners. Replication in other cities will be incentivised thus ensuring competitiveness of European Circular Economy and green growth.",2016-09-01,2020-08-31,9724969.13,,['recycling'],1,1
1469,732505,LightKone,Lightweight Computation for Networks at the Edge,"The goal of LightKone is to develop a scientifically sound and industrially validated model for doing general-purpose computation on edge networks. An edge network consists of a large set of heterogeneous, loosely coupled computing nodes situated at the logical extreme of a network. Common examples are networks of Internet of Things, mobile devices, personal computers, and points of presence including Mobile Edge Computing. Internet applications are increasingly running on edge networks, to reduce latency, increase scalability, resilience, and security, and permit local decision making. However, todayâ€™s state of the art, the gossip and peer-to-peer models, give no solution for defining general-purpose computations on edge networks, i.e., computation with shared mutable state. LightKone will solve this problem by combining two recent advances in distributed computing, namely synchronisation-free programming and hybrid gossip algorithms, both of which are successfully used separately in industry. Together, they are a natural combination for edge computing. We will cover edge networks both with and without data center nodes, and applications focused on collaboration, computation, and both.  Project results will be new programming models and algorithms that advance scientific understanding, implemented in new industrial applications and a startup company, and evaluated in large-scale realistic settings.",2017-01-01,2019-12-31,3570993.75,,['data center'],1,1
1470,734129,PJ06 ToBeFREE,Trajectory based Free Routing,"The Free Routing concept enables Airspace Users (AU) to fly as close as possible to their preferred trajectory, without being constrained by fixed airspace structures or fixed route networks.
Free Routing (FR) implementation represents a step towards a less fragmented European airspace foreseen by Single European Sky (SES) and provides the AUs with the possibility to fly their user preferred routes in accordance with their business needs or mission requirements.  FR will result in a seamless airspace enabling more efficient flight, a reduction in AU costs and will promote cheaper travel, increasing personal mobility and trade. In addition, implementing Free Routing Airspace (FRA) will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that currently contribute to global warming, thereby creating a greener airspace.

FR was addressed within the SESAR 1 programme but additional R&D activities are required to support the implementation of FRA in high and very high complexity airspace (The EU Regulation No 716/2014 mandates FRA above FL 310 from 1 January 2022) and also to extend this implementation below FL310 thereby allowing other AUs to benefit (The European Air Traffic Management Master Plan version 2015 identifies the need for R&D work to support the management of performance-based Free Routing in lower airspace)

The partners in PJ06 will validate both the benefit to AUs and the impact on ATM of this extension of FRA into complex airspace and lower vertical limits through modelling and Real Time Simulations.  The results will seek to provide evidence that FRA can be implemented, cost effectively, in all the SES airspace.

The genus Haslea species type H. ostrearia, produces marennine, a water-soluble blue pigment used for greening oysters in Western France, which is also a bioactive molecule. Haslea diatoms have thus a high potential for use in (1) existing oyster farming, (2) production of pigments and bioactive compounds with natural antibacterial properties, (3) application as a colouring agent within industry, and (4) use of silica skeletons as inorganic â€œbiochargesâ€ in the formulation of new elastomeric materials. This will be achieved through fundamental and applied-oriented research to isolate fast- growing strains of Haslea, optimising their growth environment to increase marennine and other high-value compound productivity; to develop blue biotechnology specifically applied to benthic microalgae (biorefinery approach, processes); and to develop industrial exploitation of colouring and bioactive compounds through commercial activities of aquaculture, food, cosmetics and health.",2017-03-01,2021-02-28,1602000.0,,['biorefinery'],1,1

The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Sustainable Animal Production (CWG-SAP). 
Funding organisations from 22 European countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the development of a Common Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Sustainable Animal Production. 
The animal production sector forms an important part of Europeâ€™s (agricultural) economy and plays an essential role in the provision of Europe`s citizens with high quality animal products. Like other agriculture sectors, animal production faces many challenges from projected increases in global demand for food, climate change, competition for natural resources and economic volatility. The European animal production landscape is very complex, consisting of different species farmed within a wide range of different extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems using multiple resources to produce a diverse range of animal products and other services. Partners in this ERA-NET believe, however, that these challenges and complexities can be effectively addressed through joint European research within a framework which supports the three pillars of sustainability - economy, environment and society - and targets opportunities for innovative research spanning all areas of animal production such as health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, breeding and genetics, housing, nutrient management and economics. Partners in ERA-NET SusAn endorse scientific excellence and recommend an integrated, interdisciplinary, cross-cutting and multi-actor approach to research and knowledge exchange which reflects the complexity of the research requirements for sustainable European animal production.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,5000000.0,,['nutrient management'],1,1

This market is worth more than 26 billion â‚¬/year, with a current penetration rate of traditional solar thermal technologies of less than 0.02%.
Our business idea eliminates any risk for the end user thanks to a first-of-its-kind business model which can be implemented only by exploiting our companyâ€™s unique set of achieved and planned technical developments on concentrated solar thermal systems.
We will develop cost competitive re-deployable solar boilers, i.e. turn-key and easy-to-install concentrating solar thermal systems of at least 1MWt which can be used to sell heat (as opposed to equipment) to our target customers. Industrial users rarely want to commit to long term heat purchase contracts. Re-deployability and competitive cost enable us to offer minimal initial commitment (only 3 years) for the purchase of solar heat. Afterwards, if the client is happy he will continue to buy the energy, otherwise we can take the system back and re-deploy it (i.e. use it again at a different userâ€™s site). This highly innovative commercial approach, made possible by the technological breakthrough of the systemâ€™s re-deployability, will boost market penetration.
We will demonstrate the soundness of the proposed business concept by implementing - at real industrial sites in target geographic segments - two distinct pilot installations of approx. 2â€™500 m2 of net collecting surface (i.e. more than 1MWt) each, one with Fresnel and one with parabolic collectors.
Market replication will be pursued by means of active communication to other potential users, and also to institutional and financial stakeholders.

1475,654365,BABET-REAL5,New technology and strategy for a large and sustainable deployment of second generation biofuel in rural areas,"The business model currently under development for second generation ethanol is a replication of the model used for first generation which is plants with massive annual production capacities. Such high production rates require high capital investment and huge amounts of biomasses (250-350,000 tons per year) concentrated in small radius catchment areas to afford transportation costs (50 km). Under such conditions, opportunities for installing plants in most rural areas in Europe and worldwide are scarce. The objective of the project is to develop an alternative solution for the production of 2G ethanol, competitive at smaller industrial scale and therefore applicable to a large amount of countries, rural areas and feedstocks. The target is to reach technical, environmental and economical viabilities in production units processing at least 30,000 tons equivalent dry biomass per year. This approach will definitely enlarge the scope of biomass feedstocks exploitable for the production of biofuel and create better conditions for the deployment of production sites, to the benefit of rural areas in Europe and worldwide. The main concept underpinning the project relies on a new biomass conversion process able to run all the steps from the pretreatment of the raw material to the enzymatic pre-hydrolysis in one-stage-reactor under mild operating conditions. This new process recently developed to TRL 4, offers the most integrated and compact solution for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass for the production of ethanol developed so far, and it will lead to reduced capital and operation expenditures. The new process will be developed to TRL 5 in the project with the goal of achieving satisfactory technical, environmental and economical performances in relevant operation environment.

It is a time-critical condition with survival chances decreasing by 10% with every minute of delay from collapse to defibrillation. Currently, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatchers use guidelines to recognise OHCA during emergency calls prior to activating the emergency response system. EMS are struggling as emergency calls have increased in Europe from 100 million calls in 2003 to 320 million in 2016. Thus, assistant decision tools will be necessary to help EMS to faster identify OHCA situations.

Our solution, AI4EMS, is the first and only smart digital assistant for EMS dispatchers that supports the triage decision-making by: 1) processing and analysing emergency calls in real-time; 2) recognising OHCA in an evidence-based process from large amounts of historical data (unfeasible to humans); and 3) presenting the most important insights to the EMS dispatcher in a user friendly manner. AI4EMS allows for faster (reducing almost 3 minutes on average) and more accurate (increase from 73.9% human accuracy to 95%) OHCA recognition by leveraging advanced speech analytics and AI. We offer a user-friendly and secure SaaS solution capable of communicating using Natural Language, accessed via a Nvidia TX1-based device.  We are directly supporting the eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020 and Digital Single Market (DSM) strategies, by providing a disruptive ICT technology to improve EMS dispatch efficiency and triage accuracy â€“ which will impact the economy and society at large.

With the upgrade and commercialisation of AI4EMS we will disrupt the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market for healthcare taking a step further on our goal to become world leaders in EMS artificial intelligence.

On the basis of the new results, which can disentangle different microscopic effects contrary to the often overall response split out by particles transport tools, we will be able to redefine in detail the â€œworst case scenariosâ€ in Space Weather, for each sub-parts of a solar cell and different DNA segments, with respect to current definitions. By applying data-mining/smart search algorithms we will be able to propose possible radiation-resistant materials and, on the basis of a new DNA damage descriptor, possible mitigating agents acting on specific parts of the DNA. A first-principles database of key quantities for the interaction of space radiation and materials/biological samples will be set up, to be used both for future, first-principles-only, studies or for current studies improving the input to Monte Carlo tools.

1483,716471,ACrossWire,A Cross-Correlated Approach to Engineering Nitride Nanowires,"Nanowires based on group IIIâ€“nitride semiconductors exhibit outstanding potential for emerging applications in energy-efficient lighting, optoelectronics and solar energy harvesting. Nitride nanowires, tailored at the nanoscale, should overcome many of the challenges facing conventional planar nitride materials, and also add extraordinary new functionality to these materials. However, progress towards IIIâ€“nitride nanowire devices has been hampered by the challenges in quantifying nanowire electrical properties using conventional contact-based measurements. Without reliable electrical transport data, it is extremely difficult to optimise nanowire growth and device design. This project aims to overcome this problem through an unconventional approach: advanced contact-free electrical measurements. Contact-free measurements, growth studies, and device studies will be cross-correlated to provide unprecedented insight into the growth mechanisms that govern nanowire electronic properties and ultimately dictate device performance. A key contact-free technique at the heart of this proposal is ultrafast terahertz conductivity spectroscopy: an advanced technique ideal for probing nanowire electrical properties. We will develop new methods to enable the full suite of contact-free (including terahertz, photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements) and contact-based measurements to be performed with high spatial resolution on the same nanowires. This will provide accurate, comprehensive and cross-correlated feedback to guide growth studies and expedite the targeted development of nanowires with specified functionality. We will apply this powerful approach to tailor nanowires as photoelectrodes for solar photoelectrochemical water splitting. This is an application for which nitride nanowires have outstanding, yet unfulfilled, potential.

1485,683083,RAMSES,"Reactivity and Assembly of Multifunctional, Stimuli-responsive Encapsulation Structures","In biochemical systems, combinations of specialized molecular entities are precisely arranged to give highly complex architectures. Sophisticated functionality, such as the selective chemical transformation of substrates in enzymes, emerges from the interplay of the individual components that are often grouped around a nanoscopic cavity. Control mechanisms based on the cooperative binding of signal substances regulate the enzymeâ€™s action, and complicated feedback loops may apply.
Since the advent of supramolecular chemistry, scientists construct artificial systems with ever increasing complexity and functionality that promise to serve as the basis for future developments in bottom-up nanotechnology with applications in medicine (drug delivery), diagnostics, catalysis, material science and molecular photonics/electronics.
Self-assembly of functional entities with pre-programmed connectivities has produced an impressive line-up of nanoscopic architectures such as coordination cages that recognize and transform molecular substrates. Most of these systems are based on one sort of ligand, joined by one kind of metal ion. My group has reported a number of cages, each equipped with a unique, single function such as chirality, redox-activity, light-switching, allosteric regulation or endohedral binding sites.
While all these mono-functionalized cages contribute to the progress of supramolecular architecture, nature demonstrates that the key to the most sophisticated systems lies in multi-functionalized structures.
As breakthrough strategies for achieving this level of complexity with artificial systems we propose:
1) Heteroleptic coordination of ligands by a [Pd2Ligand4]-platform-specific way of steric fine-tuning
2) Biopolymer-inspired folding of a modular chain of covalently joined building blocks
Combined with our recent achievements in host-guest switching, we aim at adjustable receptors, controllable molecular reaction chambers and multifunctional photo/redox systems",2016-12-01,2021-11-30,1982500.0,,['biopolymer'],1,1

Europe has a major agricultural waste problem, generating some 700 million tonnes of waste annually. There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. 

AgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry. The AgroCycle consortium is a large (25) multi-national group (including China) comprising the necessary and relevant multi-actors (i.e. researchers; companies in the technical, manufacturing, advisory, retail sectors (Large and SMEs); lead users; end users; and trade/producer associations) for achieving the projectâ€™s ambitions goals.

In line with the reference Topic text, these technologies will bridge cost-effective CO2 capture and purification from the atmosphere through sorbents (with efficient heat integration of the CO2 desorption step with the subsequent process stages), with electrochemical conversion of CO2 (via PEM electrolysis concepts, promoting CO2 reduction at their cathode in combination with a fruitful oxidation carried out simultaneously at the anode), followed by bioreactors carrying out the fermentation of the CO2-reduction intermediates (syngas, C1 water-soluble molecules) to form valuable products (bioplastics like Poly-Hydroxy-Alkanoates - PHA -, isoprene, lactic acid, methane, etc.) as well as effective routes for their recovery from the process outlet streams.
A distinctive feature of the CELBICON approach is the innovative interplay and advances of key technologies brought in by partners (high-tech SMEs & companies, research centres) to achieve unprecedented yield and efficiency results along the following two processing lines: i) High pressure process line tailored to the production of a PHA bioplastic and pressurized methane via intermediate electrochemical generation of pressurized syngas followed by specific fermentation steps; ii) Low pressure processing line focused on the production of value-added chemicals by fermentation of CO2-reduction water-soluble C1 intermediates.

Light energy conversion into chemical energy by photosynthetic organisms is indeed the main conversion energy step, which originated high energy containing fossil deposits, now being depleted. By the way, plant or algae biomass may still be used to produce biofuels, as bio-ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-hydrogen. Microalgae exploitation for biofuels production have the considerable advantages of being sustainable and not in competition with food production, since not-arable lands, waste water and industrial gasses can be used for algae cultivation. Considering that only 45% of the sunlight covers the range of wavelengths that can be absorbed and used for photosynthesis, the maximum photosynthetic efficiency achievable in microalgae is 10%. On these bases, a photobioreactor carrying 600 l/m-2 would produce 294 Tons/ha/year of biomass of which 30% to 80%, depending on strain and growth conditions, being oil. However this potential has not been exploited yet, since biomass and biofuels yield on industrial scale obtained up to now were relatively low and with high costs of production. The main limitation encountered for sustained biomass production in microalgae by sunlight conversion is low light use efficiency, reduced from the theoretical value of 10% to 1-3%. This low light use efficiency is mainly due to a combined effect of reduced light penetration to deeper layers in highly pigmented cultures, where light available is almost completely absorbed by the outer layers, and an extremely high (up to 80%) thermal dissipation of the light absorbed. This project aims to investigate the molecular basis for efficient light energy conversion into chemical energy, in order to significantly increase the biomass production in microalgae combining a solid investigation of the principles of light energy conversion with biotechnological engineering of algal strains.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,1441875.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

Due to its excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, copper is widely used in heating and cooling equipment and electrical devices. The rising demand caused the copper price to increase significantly.
Solving the conflict between the technological benefits arising from the excellent properties of copper and the disadvantages regarding cost and weight is possible by substituting current full copper parts by copper-aluminium hybrid parts. Within JOINâ€™EM, such components will be produced by electromagnetic pulse welding (EMW).
EMW is a high-speed joining technology using pulsed magnetic fields. The joint is formed without heat, but due to the impact of the joining partners. Disadvantages associated with conventional technologies are avoided and high-quality dissimilar material combinations can be joint.
In JOINâ€™EM, strategies for the process and tool design shall be developed for joining copper-aluminium connections and for 2 other specific material combinations. Profile-shaped components as well as sheet metal applications will be regarded.
For joint optimisation, surface preparation, design of the joint geometry, and other aspects will be investigated. A multi scale simulation strategy will be developed for determination of acting loads, deformation, impacting conditions, joint formation, and load capacity of the joint.
Designing durable and efficient tools is an indispensable prerequisite for the industrial implementation of the technology and will be addressed in the project.
The applicability of the process design strategy shall be validated based on industrial applications. Process and equipment design strategies will be evaluated in an industrial setting.

The proposed project enables for the first time the measurement of the positrons produced in the decay tunnel of conventional neutrino beams: these particles signal uniquely the generation of an electron neutrino at source. 
Neutrino facilities enhanced by the ENUBET technique will have an unprecedented control of the neutrino flux. This will allow to reduce by one order of magnitude the uncertainties on neutrino cross sections: a leap that has been sought after since decades and that is needed to address the challenges of discovering matter-antimatter asymmetries in the leptonic sector.

The apparatus is a highly specialized electromagnetic calorimeter with fast response, sustaining particle rates as high as 0.5 MHz/cm^2, having excellent electron/pion separation capabilities with a reduced number of read-out channels. ENUBET will boost technologies that have been envisaged for high energy colliders to address this new challenge. On the other hand it will operate in a substantially different configuration. The experiment will be performed at the CERN Neutrino Platform, a recently approved facility where innovative neutrino detectors will be developed exploiting dedicated hadron beam-lines from the SPS accelerator. In the first phase of the project, ENUBET will address the challenges of particle identification from extended sources, developing innovative optical readout systems and cost-effective solutions for radiation imaging. This approach is based on cutting-edge technologies for single photon sensitive devices. During the second phase, the detector will be assembled and characterized at CERN with particle beams.

Their removal in the atmosphere is controlled by their reactions with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. Recent findings from experimental studies and quantum-chemical calculations suggest that an important part of atmospheric radical chemistry, which is directly linked to the self-cleansing ability of our atmosphere, has been overlooked. This causes considerable uncertainty in our understanding of the couplings between the biosphere, atmospheric chemistry and climate. The greatest impact of this lack of understanding has been found for regions with large emissions of organic compounds from plants in remote or rural areas.
Within this project, the oxidation of organic compounds will be comprehensively investigated for the most important, biogenic organic compounds. The innovative experimental approach will quantify the radical destruction and production rates in experiments in the unique atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR at the host institution. These experiments aim to close the gap between laboratory and field studies. The advantages are: (1) Experiments will be conducted under atmospherically relevant conditions. (2) Radical recycling efficiency will be quantified for the entire chemical system, not just for single reactions. (3) The complexity of the chemical system studied will be increased from single compounds to natural plant emissions.
New innovative instrumentation will be developed for accurate and precise measurements of radical species and oxidized organic compounds. These are also of great interest beyond this project. The results of this project will improve our understanding of atmospheric radical chemistry required for accurately predicting the atmospheric radical budget, the formation of harmful secondary pollutants such as ozone, acids and aerosol and the lifetime of greenhouse gases affecting climate change.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,1850000.0,,['recycling'],1,1

We will derive new and fundamental insight in the relation between nano-scale structure and the performance of 3rd generation solar cells, and determine how to apply this in large-scale processing.
THE CHALLENGES
We currently have a superficial understanding of the correlations between structure and performance of photovoltaic heterojunctions, based on studies of small-scale devices and model systems with characterization techniques that indirectly probe their internal structure. The real structures of optimized devices have never been â€œseenâ€, and in devices manufactured by large-scale processing, almost nothing is known about the formation of structures and interfaces.
THE SCIENCE
We will take a ground-breaking new approach by combining imaging techniques where state of the art is moving in time spans on the order of months, with ultrafast scattering experiments and modelling. The techniques include high resolution X-ray phase contrast and X-ray dark-field tomography, in situ small and wide angle X-ray scattering, resonant scattering and imaging and time resolved studies of charge transport and transfer. To relate our findings to device performance, we will establish full 3D models of charge generation and transport in nano-structured solar cells.
THE FOCUS
Solution cast solar cells is the only technology that promises fast and cheap industrial scaling, and it is consequently the focus of our efforts. They require a tight control of processing conditions to ensure that the proper nano-structure is formed in the photoactive layers, with optimal contacts to charge transport layers and interfaces. The prime contenders are non-toxic polymer and kesterite solar cells.
THE IMPACT

Concretely, the main focus of LV-Pri20 is the formal and automatic analysis of privacy-preservation in todayâ€™s ICT. LV-Pri20 will focus on the prevalent wireless media, e.g., RF-identification protocols, remote car-unlocking, wearables, machine-to-machine communication in the Internet of Things (IoT)/ubiquitous computing, but it will not neglect wired environments (given their common cloud-connection). 
LV-Pri20 will assess and automatically analyse privacy-sensitive applications, in their standalone execution, as well as in the more involved setting of multiple, concurrent executions thereof. This will be done systematically and taxonomically: distinct classes of applications (e.g., identification protocols using Electronic Product Codes vs. the Open Smart Grid Protocol) and different privacy properties (e.g., data non-leakage vs. data-user unlinkability) will be respectively analysed via tailored, well-defined techniques. 
To specify privacy, LV-Pri20 will design/refine different non-classical logic languages which have inherent semantics for privacy-like expression (e.g., strategy logics). For these, we will then develop new model checking algorithms. All will be incorporated in automatic verification software, which already proved efficient in analysing highly distributed systems, inline with, e.g., the IoT applications envisaged herein.
LV-Pri20 will have a multi-disciplinary, collaborative nature, an academic core and industrial side. After an initial privacy scrutiny, new/patched RFID-based, privacy-preserving, communication protocols will be (re-)designed and implemented.

Beyond the well-known example of graphene and other exfoliated bulk materials, a new colloidal route has recently emerged towards such materials and offers a high degree of control on the structure of these nanosheets. Among these, atomically flat, quasi-two dimensional, colloidal semiconducting (CdS, CdSe and CdTe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) have very interesting opto-electronic properties. Our goal is to fully exploit the potential of these NPLs by doping them with transition metal ions (Mn2\, Cu2\ or Ag\). With the help of doping in such small systems, we can tune the absorbance, photoluminescence, carrier density and mobility of these materials and extend the potential of these materials for various applications such as field effect transistor, light emitting devices or photovoltaic solar cells. We will devise new synthetic strategies towards doped semiconducting NPLs and characterize their structural and optical and electronic properties using state of the art techniques. Advanced structural characterization (XRD, TEM, STEM) will be coupled to optical spectroscopy (fluorescence lifetimes, absorption, emission and excitation spectra) both in solution and on single objects. Afterwards, we will assemble these thin doped platelets together to form supraparticles and large-scale assemblies using different soft-matter techniques (depletion interaction, polymer grafting, templating by an interface) in order to tune their optoelectronic properties. A fine control of the assembly process would direct to new fundamental collective effects and easy processing and orientation of doped platelets, which is a prerequisite for their use in applications.",2016-01-11,2018-01-10,185076.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

Recently new variables related with the modulating effect of culture on the cognitive system have been proposed to explain differences in neurocognitive performance among people from different cultures, ethnicities or minorities. The influence of culture on neurocognitive tests is so important that DSM-5 states that neurocognitive instruments used to diagnose neurocognitive disorder must have culturally adapted norms. To date, there is no neurocognitive battery accounting for cultural differences to be used in different countries in Europe. The objective of this project will be to develop a comprehensive and domain-specific computerized neurocognitive battery for its use in adult European citizens: EMBRACED battery.

In this decentralized integrated treatment system wastewater from households and fish processing industry as well as RAS production water will radically reduce stress on the sensitive ecosystems of the Lake Victoria and will contribute to food and health security. It will be operated fully autonomous powered by renewable energies (PV, biogas). The RAS will particularly produce high quality fingerlings of the local fish species to supply the pond aquaculture of the area with stocking material.

Indeed, the current IoT landscape consists of a large set of isolated islands that do not constitute a real internet, preventing the exploitation of the huge potential expected by ICT visionaries.

To overcome this situation, VICINITY presents a virtual neighborhood concept, which is a decentralized, bottom-up and cross-domain approach that resembles a social network, where users can configure their set ups, integrate standards according to the services they want to use and fully control their desired level of privacy. VICINITY then automatically creates technical interoperability up to the semantic level. This allows users without technical background to get connected to the vicinity ecosystem in an easy and open way, fulfilling the consumers needs. Furthermore, the combination of services from different domains together with privacy-respectful user-defined share of information, enables synergies among services from those domains and opens the door to a new market of domain-crossing services.

VICINITY's approach will be demonstrated by a large-scale demonstration connecting 8 facilities in 7 different countries. The demonstration covers various domains including energy, building automation, health and transport. VICINITY's potential to create new, domain-crossing services will be demonstrated by value added services such as micro-trading of DSM capabilities, AI-driven optimization of smart urban districts and business intelligence over IoT.

Open calls are envisioned in the project to integrate further, preferably public, IoT infrastructures and to deploy additional added value services.

The aim of the project is to construct a unified description of star formation, from large to small scales, using the world's most advanced numerical physics. A two-way approach will be used: the global approach (I) will deal with the dynamics of interstellar gas on the turbulent cloud scale, while the local approach (II) will concentrate on the formation of the protostellar seed.

The objectives are:

-  Ia. Carry out a parameter study of the effects of cloud mass, turbulence, radiative transfer, and magnetization on stellar populations in giant molecular clouds
-  Ib. Create a realistic model for protostellar radiative and outflow feedback and examine its effects on the star formation efficiency
-  Ic. Quantify the effects of supernova-triggered star formation
- IIa. Simulate the formation of single protostars using extremely detailed physics (non-ideal MHD, multi-frequency radiative transfer)
- IIb. Incorporate for the first time into the simulations a chemistry module which interacts with the gas and radiation field
- IIc. Study episodic accretion events in protostars to try and explain under-luminous young stellar objects.

Much of Europe depends on water from rivers for drinking, food production, and the generation of hydropower, which is essential for meeting the EU renewable energy target. Yet only half the EU surface waters have met the WFDâ€™s 2015 target of good ecological status, due in part to the fragmentation of habitats caused by tens of thousands of dams and weirs which also pose a flood hazard. Some barriers are old and out of use, but may have historical value, while the life span of others will soon come to an end and may need to be removed. But barriers also provide energy, water, fishing and leisure opportunities, and may also help to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.

More specifically, the PEOPLE network is intended as a key driver for the development of perovskite optoelectronics. Multiple disciplines need to be involved so that PEOPLE can cover the entire knowledge chain: the design/synthesis of perovskite materials, processing/characterization of perovskite films, photovoltaic applications of perovskites, other emerging optoelectronic devices based on perovskites, device physics and photophysics. The combined expertise in PEOPLE is essential to achieve a transformative impact. This project regroups leading research teams in the domain of perovskite optoelectronics, with complementary expertise, in an attempt to synergise the research effort in this area.

The most important results from this project will be the human resources generated. This project will allow the exchange of ideas between top class researchers in Europe and China, both at a senior scientist level and most importantly at a junior level. Maintaining this ambition to educate researchers in a highly multidisciplinary fashion, in cutting edge techniques, is a central goal of this project. It is expected that the recognition and training of young talent in the development of perovskite optoelectronics will have long lasting benefits both for fundamental research and industry in Europe.",2016-01-01,2019-12-31,823500.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

Thus, changes in fungal communities driven by environmental factors and human actions on ecosystems may have, ultimately, an impact on human well-being. Understanding and predicting such changes and their subsequent impact on the provision of ecosystem services is crucial to enable scientifically sound decision-making in landâ€“use planning. However, our knowledge on such complex ecological systems is limited due to the high diversity of forest fungi and their cryptic nature. This action aims at addressing such complexity by contributing to unravelling how fungal diversity is affected by several drivers and, in turn, how it affects the provision of multiple ecosystem services to be further integrated into multifunctional forest management. This will be possible thanks to multi-scale, high-quality data on above- and belowground diversity and its potential drivers. Such data will be analyzed using advanced hybrid modelling techniques, and the resulting models will be combined in simulation-optimization routines to enable science-based decision making in forestry sensitive to fungal diversity. This will be the leading thread of an action that aims at having high impact on the research career of Dr. Sergio de Miguel for him to attain a position of maturity as an independent and interdisciplinary researcher.",2016-01-01,2017-12-31,170121.6,,['forest management'],1,1

The underlying concept of the proposal is the Smart Zero Carbon City concept, where city carbon footprint and energy demand are kept to a minimum through the use of demand control technologies that save energy and promote raised awareness; energy supply is entirely renewable and clean; and local energy resources are intelligently managed by aware citizens, as well as coordinated public and private stakeholders.
This approach will be firstly defined in detail, laid out and implemented in the three Lighthouse demonstrators (Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain, Tartu in Estonia and Sonderborg in Denmark). The three cities will develop a number of coordinated actions aimed at:
â€¢ Significant demand reduction of the existing residential building stock through cost-effective low energy retrofitting actions at district scale.
â€¢ Increase in RES share of energy supply, through extensive leveraging of local potentials.
â€¢ Enhance the use of clean energy in urban mobility, both for citizens and goods, by means of extensive deployment of green vehicles and infrastructure.
An extensive use of ICTs is planned to achieve integration and consistency in demo planning and implementation, and to enable further benefits and secure involvement of citizens.
These actions will be aligned to city-specific Integrated Urban Plans (IUPs), and the process will be replicated in two Follower cities: Lecce, (Italy), and Asenovgrad (Bulgaria) to ensure adaptability and maximize the project impact.

Because natural forage or alfalfa grown without irrigation is used to feed livestock, drinking water is considered the main source of arsenic for cattle (several studies reveal arsenic concentrations in phreatic water samples above 0.15 mg/L, the level that suggest causing chronic intoxication in cattle). Therefore, as it has been demonstrated, there is a risk of exposure for the human health due to the introduction in the food chain through milk or meat. In view of arsenic toxicity and the large number of people exposed to its effects worldwide, there is a clear need for the implementation in remote exploitations of affordable and sustainable treatment methodologies to provide potable water to cattle. To face this problem and provide a solution, NANOREMOVAS pursues to develop and implement a pilot plant for the remote treatment of arsenic polluted waters based on the application of state-of-art advanced multifunctional nanostructured materials, already tested at the laboratory level. In this sense, NANOREMOVAS includes the cooperation between the industry and academia of partners from Europe and Argentina. Besides the required research and innovation to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of the developed water recycling technique, the seconded researchers will carry out a series of tasks and outreach activities, promoting entrepreneurship culture and support of young innovative companies in order to set-up technological partnerships within the water and livestock sector.

The secondary aim is to develop new and more powerful characterisation techniques, to study PSCs, using neutrons in particular, and exploiting the potential of powerful and innovative new instruments at the neutron source ISIS, which is a partner on this proposal.  These innovative new variants of neutron reflectivity, off-specular scattering and small angle scattering (SERGIS and SESANS), use spin-echo encoding to probe length-scales previously inaccessible by neutron techniques.

The methodology to be used will consist in processing the active layers from mixed solvents with step graded variations in composition, with the main purpose of generating a series of devices with graded variations in morphology.  The as-produced active layers will be systematically investigated and compared in terms of morphology, charge mobility and photovoltaic performance; the neutron techniques available at the ISIS Neutron Spallation Source (Didcot, UK) will be complemented with a large suite of conventional laboratory-based techniques available at Sheffield University, and by x-ray scattering, both laboratory based and at synchrotron sources.

Infrared radiation, corresponding to low-frequency molecular vibrations, can also bring about photochemical reactions by multi-photon absorption. Then, how low photon energies can we reach in photochemistry? In this proposed research, I will realize a novel concept of terahertz photochemistry: activating chemical reactions with intense terahertz (THz) light of extremely low photon energy (1 THz = 4.1 meV).
 Based on this novel approach, I will study aqueous proton transfer in external electric fields, the process underlying key bioenergetic phenomena  as well as renewable energy technologies. Despite its obvious relevance, it has remained elusive how E-fields affect the known proton transfer mechanism in aqueous systems. Ultrashort THz pulses, on the one hand, will allow monitoring the THz photochemical proton transfer reactions in real time on the femtosecond time scale. On the other hand, THz light pulses will also serve as external E-fields, which bias the proton transfer reactions. 
Due to recent technological development, sub-picosecond strong field THz pulses on the order of hundreds of kV/cm with near single-cycle duration can be generated in the host laboratory, and the short pulses allow for ultrafast time resolution of ca 300 fs. Systematic studies varying field strengths and solvents will provide important insights into the local and external E-field effects on the proton transfer and the non-equilibrium solvation dynamics. The possibility of THz control over proton transport processes will also be examined by applying THz pulses at different delay time after photo-initiation.",2015-04-01,2017-03-31,159460.8,,['renewable energy'],1,1

After exocytosis, vesicular components are retrieved by endocytosis for maintaining efficient synaptic transmission. The mechanism of vesicle fusion and retrieval has been subjected to intense interest but also fierce debate for the last 40 years. Several modes of synaptic vesicle cycling have been described that rely on distinct kinetics, associated proteins and spatial organisation of the exo- and endocytosis sites. Yet, the mechanisms underlying endocytosis initiation and coupling to exocytosis are still largely unknown because the detailed dissection of single vesicle recycling remains a major challenge. Using live imaging techniques and protocols to detect fusion pore opening directly, the fate of vesicle proteins at the plasma membrane will be monitored during synaptic vesicle cycling in synapses and hemi-synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons. I will test the relative contribution of each mode of exo-endocytosis during synaptic activity. Additionally, the favourable geometry of the new hemi-synapse model will allow high resolution mapping of the presynaptic exo- and endocytosis sites. Correlating the organization of exocytosis and endocytosis sites with the location of key proteins such as calcium channels and scaffold proteins will reveal the functional microarchitecture of the presynaptic nerve terminal.

1534,694209,Scale-FreeBack,Scale-Free Control for Complex Physical Network Systems,"Technology achievements were typically built upon fundamental theoretical findings, but nowadays technology seems to be evolving faster than our ability to develop new concepts and theories. Intelligent traffic systems benefit from many technical innovations, for example. Mobile phones, radars, cameras and magnetometers can be used to measure traffic evolution and provide large sets of valuable data. Vehicles can communicate with the network infrastructure, as well as each other. However, these huge technological advances have not been used to the full so far. Traffic lights are far from functioning optimally and traffic management systems do not always prevent the occurrence of congestions.
So what is missing? Such systems affect our daily life; why arenâ€™t them on pace with technology advances? Possible because they have become far more complex than the analytical tools available for managing them. Systems have many components, communicate with each other, have self-decision-making mechanisms, share an enormous amount of information, and form networks. Research in control systems has challenged some of these features, but not in a very concerted way. There is a lack of â€œglueâ€ relating the solutions to each other.
In the Scale-FreeBack project, it is proposed to approach this problem with a new holistic vision. Scale-FreeBack will first investigate appropriate scale-free dynamic modeling approaches breaking down systemâ€™s complexity, and then develop control and observation algorithms which are specifically tailored for such models. Scale-FreeBack will also investigate new resilient issues in control which are urgently required because of the increasing connectivity between systems and the external world.

1535,694578,IsoMet,Bacterial isoprene metabolism: a missing link in a key global biogeochemical cycle,"Isoprene is a very important climate-active biogenic volatile organic compound with both global warming and cooling effects. Globally, terrestrial plants emit huge amounts (~500-750 million tonnes) of isoprene per year. This is approximately the same quantity as methane released to the amosphere. Isoprene emissions are predicted to rise due to global warming and increased use of isoprene-emitting trees (oil palm, poplar) for biofuel production but almost nothing is known about its biogeochemical cycle. Microbes are a sink for isoprene and through their activity in soils and on the leaves of isoprene-emitting plants, they will be important in removal of isoprene in the biosphere before it gets released to the atmosphere. 
The aim of the project is to obtain a critical, fundamental understanding of the metabolism and ecological importance of biological isoprene degradation and to test the hypothesis that isoprene degrading bacteria play a crucial role in the biogeochemical isoprene cycle, thus helping to mitigate the effects of this important but neglected climate-active gas. Key objectives are to elucidate the biological mechanisms by which isoprene is metabolised, establish novel methods for the study of isoprene biodegradation and to understand at the mechanistic level how isoprene cycling by microbes is regulated in the environment. Bacteria that metabolise isoprene will be isolated from a range of terrestrial and marine environments and characterised using a multidisciplinary approach and a wide range of cutting edge techniques. We will elucidate the pathways of isoprene metabolism and their regulation by characterising genes/enzymes catalysing key steps in isoprene degradation, use innovative molecular ecology methods to determine distribution, diversity and activity of isoprene degraders and assess the contribution that microbes make in the removal of isoprene from the biosphere, thereby mitigating the effects of this climate-active compound.",2016-11-01,2021-10-31,2494693.0,,['biofuel'],1,1

Current industrial protocols for their synthesis rely heavily on toxic reagents, lengthy-step pathways or waste-producing procedures such as hydrolysis of nitriles or two-step techniques based on hydroformylation of olefins with highly toxic carbon monoxide with expensive noble catalysts (Rh) followed by oxidation. Unlike hydroformylation methods, OLE-DIOX offers the opportunity of promoting a carboxylation event using unactivated olefins, products produced in bulk from petroleum processing, with abundant carbon dioxide as C1 source. The protocol is user-friendly, with components that are neither air- nor moisture sensitive, utilizes earth-abundant catalysts and operates under mild conditions. OLE-DIOX represents an important contribution for our circular economy by effectively recycling bulk materials into valuable products in one-step operation. These unique features makes OLE-DIOX technically and economically viable for its implementation at large-scale en route to industrially-valuable carboxylic acids, thus avoiding lengthy and waste-producing protocols in the established oil-to-carboxylic acid process chain.",2016-06-01,2017-11-30,149500.0,,['recycling'],1,1

This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction â€“ which will be studied numerically and experimentally â€“ the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures.

Lignocellulose-derived monomeric sugars and aromatic compounds can serve as a cheap substrates for biotechnological production of numerous value-added chemicals (VAC). However, a well-defined bacterial platform that could efficiently utilize lignocellulose for biosynthesis of VAC in a single step is still missing. The saprophytic bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a robust laboratory workhorse with versatile metabolism, has wide potential to utilize lignocellulose-derived sugars and aromatics for VAC formation. But the need for enzymatic pretreatment of the recalcitrant lignocellulose components hinders the development of a cost-effective processes. This challenge could be solved by expanding the biocatalytic functions of P. putida using cellulosomes, efficient enzymatic nanomachines displayed on the surface of certain cellulolytic microorganisms. Synthetic cellulosomes were successfully engineered in biofuel-generating yeast, but never in a Gram-negative bacterium.     
     The applicant will adopt state-of-the-art approaches and tools of synthetic biology, systems biology and metabolic engineering in order to construct P. putida displaying designer cellulosomes and forming valuable biopolymers directly from cellulosic waste. This task requires a rational orchestration of distinct physiological features of the host in order to achieve the desired qualities without compromising cell viability. In this context, the study will also propose a roadmap for massive refactoring and enrichment of native metabolic properties of environmental bacteria. Thus, the project will not only allow the applicant to enhance his research skills, but will also contribute to both understanding fundamentals of model biological systems and corporate effort aimed at establishing FUTURE knowledge-based bio-economy in Europe.",2016-10-01,2018-09-30,170121.6,,['biofuel'],1,1

Based on the exciting potential of this technique, I propose to design and construct a new time- and angle-resolved CL microscope that exploits the primary electron beam as a coherent optical excitation source with deep-subwavelength spatial resolution. We will use the new instrument to address four challenges that will provide new insight in the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Specifically, we will:
(1) use CL microscopy to excite and characterize ultra-short wavelength-plasmons on graphene. We will create 3D tomographic reconstructions of the local optical density of states in resonant plasmonic and dielectric nanostructures. 
(2) determine 2D and 3D spatially-resolved ultrafast carrier recombination processes in resonant semiconductor photovoltaic nanostructures and reveal the radiative properties of single quantum emitters.

(4) develop CL polarimetry in combination with phase-resolved CL detection to study electric and magnetic polarizabilities in nanoscale light emitters and to control the orbital angular momentum of light.
The proposed program will firmly establish time- and angle-resolved CL imaging spectroscopy as a key deep-subwavelength nanoscopy tool to investigate the interplay of electric and magnetic fields that constitute light at the nano scale, and will enable applications in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting, photonic and optoelectronic integrated circuits, quantum communication, sensing and metrology.",2016-07-01,2021-06-30,2495625.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

A infection initiates with the dissemination of the fast-replicating tachyzoites. At the onset of the immune response tachyzoites convert into slow-growing bradyzoites that form cysts in the central nervous system and in striated and heart muscles. Encystation ensures life-long persistence and poses a significant threat of reactivation during immunosuppression and can lead to encephalitis and severe clinical manifestations. Despite the importance of encystation for pathogenesis and transmission, our insight into how T. gondii defies the immune responses to take up permanent residence in the immunocompetent hosts is rudimentary. We propose to determine the molecular mechanisms governing cyst wall formation and parasite adaption to encystation. We will capitalize on the increased sensitivity of -omics approaches, the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, the high-resolution microscopy, and on the ex-vivo tissue examination by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry and NanoSIMS technologies.The specific objectives are to: 
1. Identify the components of the Cyst Wall (CW), Parasitophorous Vacuole (PV) and PMV Membrane (PVM) of the cyst
2. Determine the parasite factors responsible for CW formation and maturation via targeted and unbiased approaches
3. Define the metabolic network of parasite that is able to initiate encystation and ensure persistence 
4. Measure subversion of host metabolic functions by parasite effectors during encystation and persistence
We anticipate fundamental discoveries on i) the regulatory and trafficking circuits that govern CW formation as a biological barrier during encystation ii) metabolic adaptation and subversion of host cellular functions during encystation.

The aim is of this project is to understand the intricacies of SF so that it can be exploited to achieve dramatic increases in device efficiencies. This will be achieved using a two-pronged approach to the problem. The first is the use of newly developed ultrafast spectroscopic techniques to understand the fundamental aspects of SF. The host group is world-renowned for using spectroscopy to produce breakthroughs in our understanding of organic electronics and quantum chemistry. The second will leverage the applicantâ€™s background in physical chemistry to engineer SF systems with control on a molecular length scale. By combining these two innovations the project is expected to produce important results for the research community. These results will enhance our understanding of SF, with a view to exploit the process in real-world devices. We will elucidate the vibronic nature of intermolecular electronic processes with an unprecedented level of sensitivity. This has broader implications for our fundamental understanding of molecular physics, and the work will be a step toward an overarching picture of multi-molecular excitonic processes.",2016-10-05,2018-10-04,195454.8,,['renewable energy'],1,1

They are widely recognized as an innovative eco-system when it comes to a flexible and reliable option for the integration of distributed energy renewable resources (DER). The research on direct current (DC) power distribution systems is taking ground especially for applications where the end-use loads are natively DC (e.g. data centers, offices, residential). Efficiency, reliability, lower capital cost, simpler control strategies, higher power quality are the most cited advantages compared with AC microgrids. The primary technical research objective of this project is the design and analysis of novel methods for management and control of multiple building scale DC microgrids operating on a defined territory. Specifically the major technical objectives are: (a)To enhance the state of the art in the DC microgrid field with a holistic design, modelling, control framework for clusters of LV building level DC microgrids (the emerging community prosumers of tomorrow;) (b) To develop and validate models for typical elements of DC microgrids. The models will follow an innovative and yet unexplored approach based on hybrid dynamic system analysis; (c) To develop and test models for optimal operation of clusters of DC microgrids under uncertainty. The optimization models will look for different objectives to be optimized while taking into account the technical and economic constraints of the systems operating in either stand-alone or interconnected mode; (d) To develop and validate distributed control schemes for ad-hoc clusters of DC microgrids.

1544,704710,SDchirnanocat,Sputtering-deposition of metallic nanoparticles onto chiral ionic liquids andapplications in enantioselective hydrogenation,"The production of fine chemicals, such as chiral molecules, is one of the main applications of the chemical industry. However, any new process developed should be environmentally sound. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have attracted a large interest as catalytic materials due to their small size and high surface to bulk metal ratio, which leads to a greater catalytic activity. These catalysts are easily recyclable, although stabilizing agents are required to prevent agglomeration. In this context, ionic liquids (ILs), salts with melting point <100 ÂºC, can act both as stabilizers and as solvents. Moreover, MNPs may be immobilized in this medium, allowing the separation of the products and the subsequent recycling of the system. However, ILs are not â€œinnocentâ€ media and can impose a high degree of directionality over the substrates. The employment of chiral ILs adds a new advantage: its potential use in asymmetric catalysis to induce the formation of chiral products. In this project we will merge the asymmetric properties of newly synthesized ILs with the catalytic activity of MNPs. Instead of classical chemical methods, MNPs in ILs will be obtained by sputtering-deposition (SD), an innovative physical technique which enables the fast synthesis of clean MNPs, avoiding the use of organic solvents and reducing agents. In contrast to other physical techniques, the SD of MNPs onto ILs allows the control of the size and shape of MNPs by the appropriate tuning of the sputtering conditions. These three concepts (MNP, chiral IL and SD) converge into the main aim of this project: The development of a novel chiral catalytic system based on MNPs prepared by SD onto chiral ILs for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions. SDchirnanocat will contribute to broaden the fellow competencies and will place him in an excellent position to start an independent career.",2016-08-01,2018-07-31,195454.8,,['recycling'],1,1

The key strategy will involve the development of photoelectrodes able to perform the water oxidation (at the anode) and the carbon dioxide reduction (at the cathode), and their further assembly in a standalone set-up (i.e. requiring no other energy source, but sunlight). Thus, ARCADIA will contribute to the abatement of the atmospheric anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 by its exploitation as a renewable carbon feedstock to obtain clean fuels and value-added chemicals as the target products.",2016-05-01,2018-04-30,168277.2,,['renewable energy'],1,1

Energy harvesters convert different forms of environmental energies into electricity thus making devices self-powered. However, with over a decadeâ€™s development, energy harvesters have not been able to overtake batteries yet, although academia and industry are keen to apply it in electronics. One of the reasons is that the power level provided by a single-source energy harvester, which most research has been focused on, is not high or stable enough. Therefore, a crucial and urgent question has been raised â€“ how to release the huge potential of energy harvesting technology? This proposed action is addressing the above scientific/engineering question by exploring multi-source energy harvesting on a single piece of material. Perovskite structured materials are able to exhibit piezoelectric, pyroelectric or photovoltaic effect which has been utilised to harvest kinetic, thermal or solar energy separately. This action will combine these three effects on the same perovskite for the first time ever. Solid-state reaction will be used to synthesise the materials; thick- and thin-films will be deposited through physical methods; the materials and films will be structurally analysed, multi-functionally evaluated and compositionally optimised, to establish new inter principles of kinetic-thermal-solar multi-harvesting. Such a research topic of multi-functional materials and devices is also a â€˜â€˜roadmapâ€™â€™ of the European Science Foundation. It will conduct an interdisciplinary research across piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity and photovoltaics, and will require contributions from materials science, electronics and chemistry.

The RETINA project will investigate the potential and applicability of SV tools and Virtual/Augmented Reality (V/AR) display techniques for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) service provision by the airport control tower. Within the project, several concepts and basic principles that have been observed in different areas (e.g. Remote Tower, Synthetic Vision Systems, AR, Information Technologies, etc.) will be brought to the level of maturity required for the Applied Research that will be conducted in SESAR V1-V3 (Applied Research, Industrial Research & Validation). To this end, a 3D airport model will be developed, along with V/AR based human-computer interfaces. The digital model will provide controllers with precise positioning for both aerial and terrestrial objects, drawing information from multiple, simulated, data sources, such as the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) network, Remote Towers sensing technologies and other well-established surveillance systems â€“ e.g. Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and the Surface Movement Radar (SMR). The interface design will be based on the Ecological Interface Design approach. Finally, the project will investigate the impact of the newly conceived tools on the control tower air traffic management procedures. On the whole, those tasks that are negatively affected by poor visibility conditions, such as bad weather, fog, smoke, dust or any other kind of environmental occlusion, will become weather-independent.

1548,704201,NanoORC,Nanofluids as working fluids for organic Rankine cycles,"Organic Rankine cycles have gained great interest over the last decade as an efficient technology to convert low-temperature heat, from renewable energy or industrial waste, to electrical power. For this reason, they are expected to play a substantial role in the future European energy system, as they will contribute to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and the CO2 emissions associated to power generation. However, recent regulations that limit the use of ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases will phase out most of the working fluids currently used in organic Rankine cycles.  As a result, there is an urgent necessity to search for alternative fluids that meet the thermodynamic requirements of the replaced ones, and offer better environmental and safety features. The addition of nanoparticles to fluids (nanofluids) can enhanced their thermal properties, thus making them an optimal solution for their use in organic Rankine cycles. The main barrier for the introduction of these innovative fluids comes from the lack of an accurate knowledge of their behavior. NanoORC aims at developing a general model for the estimation of the thermophysical and transport properties of nanofluids, to evaluate their potential for organic Rankine cycles. The novelty of the project lies on the use of group contribution methods to develop a generalized model that will be integrated as a property library into simulation software. The host will provide the fellow established knowledge on organic Rankine cycles, and train her on state-of-the-art simulation and optimization tools. The fellow will bring expertise on thermophysical properties of fluids, not currently available at the host institution, to introduce the research on innovative working fluids.

1549,699306,PACAS,Participatory Architectural Change Management in ATM Systems,"Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems are large systems-of-systems that are managed via multiple layers (e.g., operational, organizational, technical) to better handle their complexity. Due to their tight interdependencies, any change introduced in either of these layers triggers changes in other layers. As such, change management in ATM systems is a difficult task and requires to know the full implications of change(s) over the whole system and support decision-making so that the ATM system does not suffer any issues with respect to functionality, safety, security, performance, cost efficiency, or other desired characteristics for a well-functioning ATM system. 
The main objective of PACAS is to better understand, model and analyze changes at different layers of the ATM system to support change management, while capturing how architectural and design choices influence the overall system. PACAS will deliver an innovative participatory change management process where stakeholders will actively participate to the architectural evolution of the ATM system.  The key elements of PACAS are: (i) domain-specific modeling languages to express heterogeneous perspectives of ATM domain experts;  (ii) impact propagation techniques to align multiple perspectives; (iii) a gamified platform as key driver for collaboration. The PACAS consortium will leverage state-of-art multi-view modeling methods, multi-objective reasoning techniques, and gamification approaches to develop and evaluate an innovative ATM participatory change management process.  The validation will be assisted an external advisory board, composed of ATM domain experts, focusing on a limited number of strategic objectives concerning economical, organizational, security and safety aspects.

Contemporary applications oblige the network operation to respond efficiently and rapidly to any user request. To achieve such demands, optical label switching (OLS) techniques have been developed to support data traffic in fiber networks. The reliable and fast processing of data headers is highly critical for trustworthy transmission flow. All-optical header recognition has been investigated lately through diverse physical implementations that offer competitive advantages; however, these configurations have been proposed as basic processing units with practically small or non-existing intelligence. Reservoir computing (RC) as a method of applying intelligence to physical systems has been lately proposed to exploit the inherent nonlinearities of photonic devices and components that are commercially available towards proficient processing of light. Lately, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) modules have been engaged to exploit nonlinearities through the fast implementation of algorithms that work towards this direction. CENTURION project aims at joining several multidisciplinary research aspects that belong to the fields of non-linear dynamics, optical communications, FPGA programming and informatics and establish FPGA-assisted and photonic RC as intelligent high-speed methodologies in data traffic management of broadband optical signals.

Initial rapid progress in the field of perovskite solar cells has slowed; efficiencies are not high enough to make them commercially attractive. Therefore, a step change is needed in how these devices are made. All perovskite solar cells so far are polycrystalline. The project will focus on solution-based epitaxial growth of single crystal perovskites, providing novel high quality thin films. These crystals will be incorporated into Si-based tandem solar cells, to form highly efficient single-crystal-on-single-crystal devices. Fabricating on top of an existing technology offers rapid commercialisation and significantly better power to cost ratio than existing technologies.

The project will comprise an outgoing phase in Prof. Michael McGeheeâ€™s group at Stanford University, whose unrivalled expertise in fabrication of hybrid tandem solar cells will be combined with the researcherâ€™s skills to fabricate single crystal perovskite-on-Si solar cells. The expertise obtained will then be transferred to the group of Prof. Sir Richard Friend at the University of Cambridge, experts in photophysics. The physical mechanisms occurring in these devices will be elucidated via ultrafast spectroscopy.  Based on these findings, devices will be further improved to attain the highest efficiencies.

The project addresses Horizon 2020's goals on clean and sustainable energy. The researcher is uniquely suited for this ambitious project, having strong expertise in perovskite and nanocrystal fabrication. It represents a novel combination of the fields of crystal growth, state-of-the-art device manufacture, and device spectroscopy.

GPC has received extensive attention as an interesting alternative for ordinary cement-based concrete as a step forward to Eco-friendly construction and thus reducing the environmental impacts of conventional construction methods and materials. Geopolymer mortars are also of great interest to be used as a sustainable matrix for conservation and strengthening of existing structures. Geopolymer concrete made of fly ash and blast furnace slag binary system is the main focus of this proposal.
The project objective will be achieved through advanced multi-scale modelling and limited experimental testing. A chemo-transport framework, in which the transport and degradation are coupled at different length scales, will be implemented for the first time to simulate the micro-structural development and degradation in GPC systems since early ages. The realization of the project will be a great step forward on the current knowledge on GPC materials and of interest for both academy and industry. The project main outputs will be the developed multi-scale framework, time-dependent chloride concentration levels at reinforcing bars' surfaces as the main indicator of durability in RC structures, and design and construction guidelines for durable GPCs. 
The project will also fill the current gaps in the knowledge of the fellow. After the project, the fellow is expected to become a leader in the field of GPC materials and multi-scale modelling.

1553,699249,COMPAIR,COMPetition for AIR traffic management,"The provision of ATM services has for a long time been a national monopoly, with the important role attributed to the nation state (by ICAO) of managing air traffic safely in its national airspace. In addition, provision of air traffic services (ATS) has traditionally been considered a natural monopoly due to the large infrastructure investments. These elements are now both changing. The European Union is increasingly entering the air traffic management world, opposing the national character of the industry and increasing the scale at which air traffic services could be provided. In addition, technological changes are more and more reducing the need for large scale ground-based infrastructure and expensive equipment, putting into question the natural monopoly character of the industry. Therefore today is the right time to study the liberalization and introduction of competition in the ATM sector. However, competition can be introduced at various levels and in different ways. 
The overall goal of COMPAIR is to investigate how to introduce competitive incentives in the ATM sector so as to best contribute to the achievement of the European high-level policy objectives for aviation. The project will pursue the following objectives:
1. propose a set of new institutional market designs for the introduction of competition in the European ATM sector;
2. define a framework allowing a comprehensive assessment of the impact of different institutional market designs on ATM stakeholders and society at large;
3. develop a variety of economic and network simulation models allowing the evaluation of the proposed regulatory approaches along the dimensions identified as relevant in the assessment framework; 
4. assess the feasibility and acceptability of proposed institutional changes for various market actors;

In particular, ABRA actions will focus on the creation of a substantial increase of the real estate value of the existing buildings through a significant energy and architectural transformation. The central goals of the proposal consist of an important reduction of the pay back time of the interventions, a strengthening of the key investorsâ€™ confidence, increasing quality and attractiveness of the existing buildingsâ€™ stock and, finally, reaching a concrete market acceleration towards the Nearly Zero Energy Buildings target. The actual investment gap in the deep renovation sector is due to the fact that high investments are required up-front and they are generally characterised by an excessively high degree of risk and long payback times. It is therefore necessary to develop harmonized, concerted and innovative actions to unlock the needed public and private funds, fill the energy efficiency investment gap and ultimately contribute to re-launch the construction market and create new jobs. Therefore, ABRA aims at demonstrating to the key stakeholders and financial investors the attractiveness of a new renovation strategy based on AdoRe, intended as one (or a set of) Assistant Building unit(s) - like aside or faÃ§ade addictions, rooftop extensions or even an entire new building construction - that adopt the existing buildings (the Assisted Buildings).  The creation of these new Assistant Buildingsâ€™ Additions integrated with Renewable Energy Sources aims at reducing the initial investment allocated for the deep renovation of the existing building creating an up-grading synergy between old and new.

The principal idea is in realization of low-temperature (below 100 ÂºC) syntheses directly in polar solvents (water, dimethyl-sulfoxide, etc.) using non-volatile and low-toxic sulfur and selenium sources. Such syntheses will be realized in ambient conditions (no vacuum and inert atmosphere required) and on the gram-scale by using chalcogenide complexes of metals (Sn, In, Sb, etc.) as stabilizers imparting the NCs with the resistance to aggregation and ability to form self-assembled layers after the solvent evaporation. The synthetic protocols will be selected allowing for a precise control of the NC composition and size. The binary and ternary metal chalcogenide NCs will be tested as visible-light-sensitive components of prototype liquid-junction and solid-state SCs where the NCs will serve as spectral sensitizers of the wide-band-gap oxide AIIBVI-type photoanodes to enable photocurrent generation.

1556,698824,MALORCA,Machine Learning of Speech Recognition Models for Controller Assistance,"One of the main causes hampering the introduction of higher levels of automation in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) world is the intensive use of spoken language as the natural way of communication. Data link will be another media of communication with its known advantages compared to voice communication but for the future it is still assumed that data link communication will increase but never fully replace voice communication. Particularly for the time being controllers and pilots exchange information by spoken language, whereas automated systems understand the situation based only on sensor information. This difference in the end creates misunderstandings between operators and systems which lead to failures and further on to a lack of acceptance for automation. One promising solution is the introduction of automatic speech recognition as an integral part of automation.
Recently, the venture capital funded project AcListantÂ® has achieved command error rates below 2% based on Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR), developed by Saarland University (USAAR) and DLR. ABSR combines speech recognition with an assistant system, which generates context information to reduce the search space of the speech recognizer.
One main issue to transfer ABSR from the laboratory to the ops-rooms is its costs of deployment. Each ABSR model must manual adapted to the local environment due to e.g. different accents and deviations from standard phraseology. This project proposes a general, cheap and effective solution to automate this re-learning, adaptation and customisation process to new environments, taking advantage of the large amount of speech data available in the ATM world.

Forefront approaches based on bioengineered nanoparticles might have the potential to target specific cell pathways, thus controlling downstream cell activities in a space and time selective fashion.  The present project aims to develop and to validate a smart nanovectorable to activate a specific cell signalling and, on demand, to induce heat mediated cell death of nanovector targeted cells. As proof of concept, CONFINES is conceived to target the Wnt canonical pathway, one of the most studied and fascinating cell signalling, which orchestrates central mechanisms that govern cell proliferation, polarity and stem cell fate. To achieve the proposed objectives, a controlled synthetic approach will tailor Wnt ligands on magnetic nanoparticles, combining targeting and magnetic properties in a uniquenanovector. Owing to its chemico-physical features, NanoWnt will enable complete control of the cell signalling, and it will operate in vitro (human cell cultures) and in vivo (the aquatic invertebrateHydra vulgaris), in a dual mode: i) as an activator of the canonical Wnt pathway in those contexts where it is inactive ii) or upon exposure to a magnetic field, as a nanoheater, enabling specific cell ablation by hyperthermia. From a technological point of view, the project will advance basic knowledge on thermal ablation (via magnetic hyperthermia) and holds promises for translational medicine, providing a breakthrough tool to shape cell fate of nanovector receiving cells.

The results will be used to predict the evolution of these systems when facing impending climatic and socioeconomic changes. tRRACES will provide a sound scientific basis for the so called 'indigenous knowledge' and will contribute highly valuable information for the studies on sustainable land-use, meaning that it is possible to state with confidence that the proposed project will undoubtedly produce useful data for modern developmental and conservationist narratives.'",2015-08-17,2017-08-16,195454.8,,['soil management'],1,1
1559,656385,ENIRIS,Electrogenic NItrate Reduction In marine Sediments,"Recently, a novel type of long, filamentous bacteria has been discovered, which are capable of guiding electrical currents over centimeter distances. These so-called â€œcable bacteriaâ€ were first isolated from marine sediments, and laboratory experiments demonstrate that electrons are passed on from cell to cell along the longitudinal axis of the filaments. This long-distance electron transport radically extends the physiological capacities of prokaryotes, and profoundly changes our understanding of biogeochemical transformations in marine sediments. 
In my PhD research, I have documented that in addition to oxygen, these sulphur oxidizing bacteria can also use nitrate as an electron acceptor. This new form of â€œelectrogenicâ€ nitrate reduction could have important implications for the removal of bio-available N in marine ecosystems. However, the effect of this newly described nitrate reducing process on the global nitrogen cycle, as well as the factors that ultimately control the occurrence, remain unknown.
The goal of this project is to identify the end products of the electrogenic nitrate reduction and the environmental controls that regulate its occurrence. This project will hence provide new insights into the physiological abilities of micro-organisms and improve our understanding of N dynamics in marine sediments, strengthening European excellence in these fields of research.
The goals of the project will be attained by combining state-of-the-art biogeochemical techniques with a novel and interdisciplinary approach based on principles traditionally applied in microbiology, electrochemistry and geophysics.

These primarily concern a three-fold increase in current density (resulting in the proportional decrease in capital costs) whilst maintaining cutting edge efficiency, a material use minimisation approach in terms of reduced membrane thickness whilst keeping the gas cross-over low, and reducing the precious metal loading. Further, improving the stack lifetime to 10 years and a reduction of the system complexity without compromising safety or operability. All these solutions contribute significantly to reducing the electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX costs.

Therefore an empirical study on rare metals including rare earth elements and its importance to European economy in terms total demand, the issue of stable supply, recycling capacity of European companies, value addition and value chain management become important aspects to study and applying an input-output matrix and network diagram, the study will trace the entire value chain of the identified minerals from mining to intermediate products to final products and calculate the value addition in each stage",2015-10-01,2017-09-30,177598.8,,['recycling'],1,1
1562,657039,Repower Democracy,Repower Democracy: How grassroots energy initiatives are changing the face of democracy in Europe,"When in 2013, a multinational energy corporation started to set up a drilling site in Å»urawlÃ³w â€“ a village in eastern Polandâ€“ residents sprang into action to protest the plans to use fracking (an unconventional method of shale gas extraction). Like social movements in the recent global wave of protest (such as Occupy, Indignados), they engaged in egalitarian organising. Finally, the corporation abandoned the village but the residents' activism did not end. Like the citizens in Å»urawlÃ³w, similar anti-fracking groups in Europe are working on initiatives to build democratically-run renewable energy solutions. This project investigates the potential of such groups for a repowering of democracy, i.e. a reformulation of democratic models and a reorganisation of energy production along more egalitarian lines. The main objectives of the research are: (1) to investigate the forms of politicisation and imaginaries of egalitarianism in Polish and British communities and (2) to build interdisciplinary, inter-sectoral collaborations and draw up research-led strategies for local and systemic social innovation in the field of democratic self-organisation of energy initiatives. I will employ ethnographic research, local historical and rural sociological investigation to identify best democratic practice models of the communities. Through participatory action research and together with research participants we will develop and implement a framework for the assessment of community's energy potential. The projects' interdisciplinary nature contributes to critical enquiry into the possibilities of more democratic futures and their interrelationship with transitions of energy systems. The core focus is on the local dynamics of grassroots organising and its intersections with (inter)national structures. The overarching aim is to repower democracy in Europeâ€“ to help its citizens to be actively engaged in democratic processes by taking responsibility for tackling major societal challenges.",2015-05-04,2017-05-03,196400.4,,['renewable energy'],1,1

They promise to increase the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by enabling tandem cells that absorb light at both electrodes, in similar fashion to multi-junction semiconductor PV.  However, no component of the p-DSSC is fully optimised, and the nickel oxide (NiO) substrates used as the p-type semiconductor appear to be a particular weak point, due to their inefficient charge transport.  In this project, we will develop new copper(I) halide electrodes which transport charge much better, and will potentially form the heart of new, efficient p-DSSCs.",2015-09-03,2017-09-02,195454.8,,['PV'],1,1
1564,715634,HY-CAT,Multifunctional Hybrid Platforms based on Colloidal Nanocrystals to Advance CO2 Conversion Studies,"In reimagining the worldâ€™s energy future, while researchers are seeking alternative ways to produce energy, our current dependence on fossil fuels requires us to capture and store the CO2 to prevent reaching unacceptable CO2 levels in the atmosphere. In this scenario, recycling CO2 by converting it into useful chemicals, such as fuels for transportation, represents an important research area as it will eventually lead to independence from fossil fuels and petroleum. While much progress has been made, this emerging field is challenged by huge technical and scientific questions. The intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the CO2 molecule, combined with slow multi-electron transfer kinetics, makes its reduction exceedingly energetically demanding. Hy-Cat aims to develop novel material platforms to investigate different chemical paths that promote electrochemical CO2 reduction and direct product selectivity. We will synthesize hybrid materials comprising atomically defined CO2 sorbents and nanocrystalline CO2 catalysts intimately bound in a single integrated system. Three different classes of hybrids, each characterized by one specific absorption/pre-activation mechanism, will allow to investigate the effect of each mechanism on the catalyst activity. A key component of the research will be to develop synthetic schemes to access these multifunctional systems with an unprecedented level of control across multiple lengthscales. This control and the intrinsic tunability of the chosen building blocks will allow us to methodically compare structure and activity, so to determine the design principles upon which better catalysts can be made. We will argue that this understanding is required to remove the main bottlenecks towards efficient and selective catalysts to convert CO2 into useful products, such hydrocarbons.

Within the scope of this fellowship, hosted by Dublin City University (Ireland) in collaboration with Arrows Biomedical GMBH (Germany), a highly sensitive platform to detect Human Papillomavirus (HPV), causative agent of about 99.7% of cervical cancer, will be developed. The proposed diagnostic platform will be based on a laser textured biopolymer as device substrate, functionalized with nanoparticles produced via the Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL) technique. This on-chip immunoassay will allow rapid detection of the HPV. The novelty of this project lies in the high-quality bio-nanostructures as nano-labels via PLAL designed for ultrasensitive detection of HPV.

There are evidences that bioactive compounds incorporated in lipid nanoparticles present an enhanced bio-accessibility in the gastrointestinal due to their small droplet size. However, the incorporation of active nanosized ingredients in foods remains a challenge for the food sector. Lipid nanoparticles may interact with the food matrix components causing destabilization phenomena or binding, which in turn might decrease their biological activity. Moreover, food processing operations used after the incorporation of the active lipid nanoparticles may have an impact in their properties. In this context, NANOLIPID, aims to contribute to the design, characterization and application of bioactive lipid nanoparticles towards a more rational and optimal use of food ingredients.

The project focuses on bio-inspired molecular circuits, where several light-absorbing molecules are linked together to form antenna systems displaying ultrafast electronic energy transfer (EET). We aim to identify and understand how coherent effects can direct, control, and optimize energy flow after photo-excitation. PHOEBUS will answer to the following questions: (i) does coherence radically change excitation transport compared to incoherent hopping of excitation? (ii) how can we design chemical structures that use coherence in light harvesting? Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is the ideal experimental tool to track EET and unveil coherent couplings in multi-chromophoric complexes. This optical technique is at the frontier of ultrafast spectroscopy. We will develop a 2DES apparatus using sub-10fs optical pulses and we will use it to determine the quantum-chemical rules guiding ultrafast EET in these innovative systems.

1576,833915,TrafficFluid,Lane-free Artificial-Fluid Environment for Vehicular Traffic,"'Traffic congestion is a serious threat for the economic and social life of modern societies as well as for the environment, which calls for drastic and radical solutions. The proposal puts forward an utterly original idea that leads to a novel paradigm for vehicular traffic in the era of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and is based on two combined principles.

The first principle is lane-free traffic, which renders the driving task for CAVs smoother and safer, as risky lane-changing manoeuvres become obsolete; increases the static and dynamic capacity of the roadway due to increased road occupancy; and mitigates congestion-triggering manoeuvres. The second principle is the nudge effect, whereby vehicles may be 'pushing' (from a distance, using sensors or communication) other vehicles in front of them; this allows for traffic flow to be freed from the anisotropy restriction, which stems from the fact that human driving is influenced only by downstream vehicles. The nudge effect may be implemented in various possible ways, so as to maximize the traffic flow efficiency, subject to safety and convenience constraints.

TrafficFluid combines lane-free traffic with vehicle nudging to provide, for the first time since the automobile invention, the possibility to design (rather than merely describe or model) the traffic flow characteristics in an optimal way, i.e. to engineer the future CAV traffic flow as an efficient artificial fluid. To this end, the project will develop and deliver the necessary vehicle movement strategies for various motorway and urban road infrastructures, along with microscopic and macroscopic simulators and traffic management actions.

TrafficFluid risk stems from the immense challenge of designing a new traffic system from scratch; however, we expect that the project will trigger a whole new path of international innovative research developments and testbeds that would pave the way towards a new efficient traffic system in the era of CAVs.

While it is established that tropical tree mortality increases under hot and dry conditions, key questions regarding why and how remain unresolved. Which traits predispose trees to mortality? How does drought and heat interact to affect tropical tree growth and survival under field conditions? The overall goal of my project is to determine the sensitivity of tropical tree species to heat and drought, and based on this knowledge develop a trait-based tree mortality model that can be used to provide recommendations on which trees are suitable to different climatic regions in Rwanda, central Africa. Such recommendations are crucial for reforestation programs and climate change adaptation in Rwanda, a low-income country which has been heavily deforested in the past. To achieve this goal, I will identify which tree traits (structural, hydraulic, physiological, biochemical) that control the vitality and survival of tropical trees in multi-species plantations established at three sites in Rwanda. The sites exhibit large natural variation in precipitation and temperature, and experimental manipulations of water supply (irrigation, rainfall exclusion) are imposed at each site. Traits will be determined using a broad range of gas exchange, hydraulic and biochemical methods in the field as well as in the lab. A multi-trait model of drought- and heat-induced tree mortality will be derived based on data from the experimental sites, and evaluated using independent data from additional sites with larger trees. Based on this model, I will provide tree plantation recommendations to relevant stakeholders in Rwanda and the region. By bringing together perspectives from experimental ecology and vegetation modelling to address critical knowledge gaps this projects will make original contributions to improve the understanding and predictability of tropical tree mortality in a changing climate.",2019-09-01,2021-08-31,191852.16,,['reforestation'],1,1

As the most sustainable and cheapest disposal option, agricultural use of biosolids is encouraged as a part of a resource recovery solution by turning waste into a key resource. Anaerobic digestion is a common practice for sludge stabilization as an energy-efficient process before the beneficial reuse of biosolids. However, presence of the emerging micropollutants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products is creating potential human and environmental health threats despite the technological advancements in anaerobic sludge digestion. Europe needs to take immediate action for solving this issue; to safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and wellbeing within objectives of the EU 7th Environment Action Programme. RADIOFREPOLIS intends to investigate the occurrence and transformation of target pharmaceutical and personal care products by applying an innovative and energy-efficient radio frequency sludge pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion as the first time in the literature for moving towards non-toxic environment. Proposed solution will reduce the uncontrolled release of micropollutants into the environment via sludge as well as reducing the quantity of excess sludge, improving the quality of sludge and increasing renewable energy to obtain a positive energy balance of the overall process, which will contribute to competitiveness of Europe. RADIOFREPOLIS will transfer knowledge on this newly acquired custom-built radio frequency heating technology to Europe and develop a novel project with multidisciplinary collaboration.

1579,752773,GeoElectricMixing,Geophysical Signature of Subsurface Reactive Mixing,"Subsurface reactive processes play a key role in dictating the evolution of subsurface environments, their interaction with surface water bodies and the migration and remediation of transported contaminants. In particular reactive hot spots tend to concentrate in mixing fronts between fluids of different compositions, such as recently infiltrated/injected fluids and resident groundwater, which develop in a range of situations, including CO2 sequestration operations and geothermal systems, contaminant remediation operations, and reactive hyporheic zones beneath rivers. Our understanding of the development and temporal dynamics of these hotspots is currently hampered by the limited sampling offered by boreholes. Recent breakthroughs in geoelectrics may however profoundly change our vision of these phenomena by providing non-invasive techniques with high sensitivity to many geological processes. GeoElectricMixing will hence develop a novel approach to investigate the temporal dynamics of reactive mixing processes from Complex Impedance and Self Potential signals. The coupling of reactive mixing and geoelectrics will be quantified and upscaled by integrating charge transport and polarization phenomena in a new modeling framework, recently developed by the host to predict the spatial distribution of chemical species and reaction rates across mixing fronts (WP1). Dedicated experiments will then be designed by integrating electrodes in a novel millifluidic setup to monitor jointly the temporal evolution of geoelectrical parameters and the spatial distribution of concentrations and reactions rate in a reactive mixing front progressing through the cell (WP2). GeoElectricMixing is thus expected to open a new window on subsurface reactive mixing phenomena, expanding our capacities to detect and quantify these processes in situ, and thus providing critical data to unlock current open questions on the dynamics of mixing processes and their role in reaction enhancement.",2017-04-01,2019-03-31,173076.0,,['geothermal'],1,1
1580,756998,SnowRESolution,All-Weather Snow machine driven by Renewable Energy Sources,"The ski business and mountain economy depend on the randomness of snowfalls. Climate change is shortening the ski season because of less snow precipitation and of higher average winter temperature. Ski resorts have to counteract the lack of natural snow, and to guarantee the opening of ski district in the most touristic periods. Current snowmaking techniques (fans and cannons) require an air temperature below 0Â°C and low humidity, thus are not applicable for large part of the season. NeveXN developed a technology able to produce high quality snow at temperatures above 0Â°, in all weather condition and without any chemical additives. SnowRESolution is a clean-tech snowmaker that works also when traditional snowmakers cannot be operated. The technology is based on the refrigeration cycle and exploits the triple point of water, a condition that occurs at 0Â°C and almost in vacuum (6mbar) at which the three phases of ice, liquid, and vapour are in equilibrium. The compressor is driven by thermal energy that is provided by renewable energy sources, which may be either a solar thermal collector or a biomass steam boiler. Winter tourism is very important in all mountain regions, and risk to undergo to huge losses if slopes are bare. SnowRESolution address the market of ski resorts that want to guarantee the production of snow also when ambient temperature is above 0Â°C, enabling an early opening of the ski season.

The roll-out of new energy efficient plug-and-play units should reduce the specific energy consumption by more than 25 %, simultaneously reducing the total cost of ownership. A scientific-supported introduction of innovative packages, all parts made in Europe, applying the natural working fluid CO2 and the latest efficiency enhancing technologies will validate the suitability of the CO2 heat pumping and refrigeration technology for warm climate applications.

The EU F-gas regulation forces the end-users to request new heat pump solutions in the near future. The upcoming process of replacing non â€“renewable or F-gas based heating/cooling units, especially in Southern Europe, represents the business case for the industry. Especially South-European contractors have to be trained to become confident and motivated to offer innovative heat pumping solutions, as for example developed by MulitPACK.

Pack manufacturers, typically being SMEs like ENEX, do not have the possibility to shake down new developments in a laboratory environment representing real life conditions. Therefore, MultiPACK will reduce the risk and fear for the end-user accepting the installation of demonstration/validation units in their properties, solving the challenge of â€œinnovation without risk for the end userâ€.

To this aim, six remotely controlled and monitored demonstration/validation sites (3/3) at several South-European locations at energy demanding end-users will be utilised.  The real performance of new integrated packs providing refrigeration/space cooling & heating with high levels of indoor comfort and sanitary hot water demand will be measured and reported.

Training material supporting end users and contractors towards a successful implementation of integrated packs will become public via the MulitPACK communication centre.",2016-10-01,2019-09-30,3671856.38,,['heat pump'],1,1
1582,723600,LASIMM,Large Additive Subtractive Integrated Modular Machine,"The LASIMM project aim is to develop a large scale flexible hybrid additive/subtractive machine based on a modular architecture which is easily scalable. The machine will feature capabilities for additive manufacture, machining, cold-work, metrology and inspection that will provide the optimum solution for the hybrid manufacturing of large engineering parts of high integrity, with cost benefits of more than 50% compared to conventional machining processes.
For large scale engineering structures material needs to be deposited at a relatively high rate with exceptional properties and excellent integrity. To ensure this the machine is based on wire \ arc additive manufacture for the additive process. A unique feature of the machine will be the capability for parallel manufacturing featuring either multiple deposition heads or concurrent addition and subtraction processes. To facilitate parallel manufacturing the machine architecture is based on robotics. To ensure that the surface finish and accuracy needed for engineering components is obtained for the subtractive step a parallel kinematic motion robot is employed. This robot is also used for application of cold work by rolling between passes. This ensures that material properties can be better than those of forged material. 
A key part of this project is the development of ICT infrastructure and toolboxes needed to programme and run the machine. The implementation of parallel manufacturing is extremely challenging from a software perspective and this will be a major activity within the project.
To deliver this extremely demanding and ambitious project a well-balanced expert team has been brought together. There are ten partners comprising six companies, two Universities and two research institutes. Two of the companies are SMEs and there are three end users from the renewable energy, construction and aerospace sectors.

1585,734160,PJ15 COSER,Common Services,"The legacy of  Air Traffic Management (ATM)  evolution in Europe has resulted in todayâ€™s highly fragmented, country-based, services. A consequence of this fragmentation, there is a negative impact on the cost in the provision of ATM service in Europe.  
A fundamental goal of the Single European Sky initiative is to â€œprovide ATM services to airspace users at a cost of at least 50 % lessâ€. 
The notion of Common Service aims to contribute to this goal. Common Services, defined as â€œa service that provides capability to consumers in the same way that they would otherwise need to provide themselvesâ€, aims to mitigate this issue. Common Service approach follows a general principle within the Single European Sky initiative that encourages the harmonisation on the provision of common air navigation services wherever it is possible.
The main benefit of this approach is to deliver enhanced cost effectiveness to both the providing and consuming organisations and this could in turn potentially benefit the whole chain in the European air transportation business, making it more attractive as means of transport. Additionally, there could be a positive impact on other ATM performance areas as well, such as capacity, safety, flight efficiency, etc.
The providing organisations would benefit from economy of scale, while the consumers would not need to maintain and update proprietary solutions anymore. Overall, a better rationalisation of deployment should be expected.
Therefore this Common Service approach, if it is proved to be successful, could be viewed as an essential means to improve the overall cost effectiveness of the ATM business in Europe.

The GELCLAD is produced using a single co-extrusion procedure in which both ecoWPC framing skin and FEA core are simultaneously formed such that no discontinuity is formed between them. Using a multilayer effective continuous extrusion allows the benefits of high quality multi-meso-structured systems and productive production to be obtained without the traditional drawbacks of existing bonding lamination of extremely high embodied energy insulation materials, and high labouring and skilled installation of multi material layers. By combining also this biopolymer based ecoWPC/aerogel with passive pre-programed materials responding dynamically to ambient stimuli and control the air flow, GELCLAD wants to target the market as a novel environmentally friendly multi-functional smart cladding solution, to be used as an ecological alternative to the current cladding and ventilated faÃ§ade systems. The foreseen impacts of the novel GELCLAD will be 20% lower embodied energy and carbon than traditional oil based panels, attain more than 40% reduction of energy savings due to GELCLAD refurbishment, reduce costs of 40% over traditional faÃ§ade thanks to single panel systems, less installation and maintenance expenses, while providing functional building envelope solutions for a life span over 50 years.

This led to the production of important knowledge, unfortunately disseminated. Numerous databases have also been developed, sometimes as duplicates.
For the first time in the history, SCRREEN aims at gathering European initiatives, associations, clusters, and projects working on CRMs into along lasting Expert Network on Critical Raw Materials, including the stakeholders, public authorities and civil society representatives. 
SCRREEN will contribute to improve the CRM strategy in Europe by (i) mapping primary and secondary resources as well as substitutes of CRMs, (ii) estimating the expected demand of various CRMs in the future and identifying major trends, (iii) providing policy and technology recommendations for actions improving the production and the potential substitution of CRM, (iv) addressing specifically WEEE and other EOL products issues related to their mapping and treatment standardization and (vi) identifying the knowledge gained over the last years and easing the access to these data beyond the project.
The project consortium also acknowledges the challenges posed by the disruptions required to devlop new CRM strategies, which is why stakeholder dialogue is at the core of SCRREEN: policy, society, R&D and industrial decision-makers are involved to facilitate strategic knowledge-based decisions making to be carried out by these groups.

landfills, predating the EU Landfill Directive of 1999. These older landfills tend to be filled with municipal solid waste
and often lack any environmental protection technology. In order to avoid future environmental and health problems,
many of these landfills will soon require expensive remediation measures. This situation might appear bleak, but it does
present us with an exciting opportunity for a combined resource-recovery and remediation strategy, which will drastically
reduce future remediation costs, reclaim valuable land, while at the same time unlocking billions of tonnes of valuable
resources contained within these landfills. However, the widespread adoption of Enhanced Landfill Mining (ELFM)
in the EU, as envisaged by NEW-MINE, urgently requires skilled scientists, engineers, economists and policy makers
who can develop cost-effective, environmentally friendly ELFM practices and regulatory frameworks. All this demands
a European commitment to concerted, inter- and transdisciplinary research and innovation. The NEW-MINE project
trains 15 early-stage researchers (ESRs) in all the aspects of landfill mining, in terms of both technological innovation
and multi-criteria assessments for ELFM. The technological innovation follows a value-chain approach, from advanced
landfill exploration, mechanical processing, plasma/solar/hybrid thermochemical conversion and upcycling, while the
multi-criteria assessment methods allow the ESRs to compare combined resource-recovery/remediation ELFM methods
with the â€œDo-Nothingâ€, â€œClassic remediationâ€ and â€œClassic landfill mining with (co-)incinerationâ€ scenarios.

In general, the transport network in Europe is of a high standard but is still fragmented regarding the geographical distribution and the transport modes.
In recent years, first networking activities and exchange of strategic programmes among the stakeholders of the four transport modes â€“ road, rail, water and air â€“ can be noticed but still a mono-modal, mono-disciplinary culture exists. In the light of the future challenges, e.g. increasing transport demand, ageing infrastructure, scarcity of natural resources, changing climatic conditions, it is inevitable to strengthen the collaboration of the single transport modes in order to create an improved future integrated and functioning transport system for Europe, despite of limited financial resources of the owners of the transport network.
The FOX project aims to develop a highly efficient and effective cross-modal R&D environment and culture which meets the demanding requirements of the transport and connectivity. Based on already existing programmes and agendas related to the aspects of co-modal transport research, the FOX project will identify common needs and innovative techniques in the areas of construction, maintenance, inspection, and recycling & reuse of transport infrastructure. This will be reached by the involvement of all stakeholders (owners, researchers, and industry) of the four transport modes in a phased approach: Starting with the determination of the state-of-the-art in research and practice, in the next step the most promising practices and ideas will be identified.

CoPro will provide decision support to operators and managers and develop closed-loop solutions to achieve an optimally energy and resource efficient production. 
In most plants of the process industries, the energy and resource efficiency of the production depends critically on discrete decisions on the use of equipment, shutdowns, product changeovers and cleaning or regeneration of equipment. CoPro will consider these discrete decisions in plant-wide dynamic optimization and develop integrated scheduling and control solutions. Advanced online data analytics will be developed for plant health and product quality monitoring. The detection of anomalies will trigger fast re-scheduling and re-optimization.
CoPro will demonstrate advanced plant-wide and site-wide coordination and control in five typical use cases that cover a wide range of sectors of the process industries, and the whole value chain:
- Petrochemical production site
- Base chemicals and polymer production site
- Recycling system in cellulose production
- Consumer product formulation and packaging plant
- Food processing plant
In addition,CoPro will develop methods for the coordination of plants in industrial parks that belong to different companies, thus providing a basis for future industrial symbiosis.
CoPro pays special attention to the role of operators and managers in plant-wide control solutions and to the deployment of advanced solutions in industrial sites with a heterogeneous IT environment.

There is a necessity to explore new approaches to connect profitable forest management with changing societal demands. Against this background, innovative mechanisms (IM), including novel policies and business models, have the potential to align ecosystem services supply and demand. SINCERE will, first, systematically map the existing knowledge and practical experiences with IM at the European scale. Second, it will, in a joint effort of practice partners and researchers, design, implement and subsequently evaluate a complementary set of innovation actions that explore novel IM in different regional contexts. These actions encompass a broad spectrum of forest ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity, climate change mitigation, water supply, recreation), governance mechanisms (e.g. new business models, â€˜reverse auctionsâ€™ with forest owners, participatory governance) and regional settings (e.g. intensively managed commercial forests in Finland versus little-managed forest land in Spain). Third, a Learning Architecture will connect these innovation actions across countries to incentivize cross-case fertilization and learning between research and practice. Finally, practice partners, policy makers and researchers will jointly draw lessons learnt from the innovation actions, including the upscaling of successful IM to be replicated elsewhere.

As the digitalisation and data-based economy are growing, the exploitation potential of the wearables can easily be expected to increase. Key wearables stakeholder groups in the future are also smart cities, comprising intelligent building industry and infrastructure, energy-efficient smart grid sector, public e-Services, and smart transport. Motivated by the opportunities that next-generation wearable intelligence is expected to provide, the mission of A-WEAR action is to cross-disciplinarily create new architectures, open-source software and frameworks for dynamic wearable ecosystems, with distributed localization and privacy constraints. We aim at building new joint/double European doctoral programmes to train a new generation of young researchers in order to be aware of, to cope with, and to disseminate to a large audience the vulnerabilities and the corresponding solutions of the communication and positioning through wearables. The impact of A-WEAR will be to enhance the future social well-being, to contribute to an easy living, effective and enjoyable work, and to offer new solutions to the challenges of violation of privacy by communication and positioning through wearables and to the need of applying the right of the ownership to oneâ€™s data.",2019-01-01,2022-12-31,3762325.8,,['smart grid'],1,1
1600,798891,ANTHEM,Advanced Hybrid Thermoelectric Materials through Vapor Phase Infiltration,"Waste heatâ€”the rejected by-product of all energy conversion processesâ€”remains a huge and unexplored reservoir of green energy. It is estimated that two-thirds of the 160 TWh required for global power consumption is lost to the environment each year. Converting even a fraction of this wasted energy into electricity at the cost of 10 cents per kWh would generate a new EUR 1.0 trillion industryâ€”creating jobs, boosting the economy, and increasing energy efficiency. A scalable preparative strategy towards inexpensive thermoelectric (TE) materials would allow direct heat to electricity conversion to be widely implemented. Realizing this ambition will require a new approach, as current methods rely on rare, toxic, and expensive materials to produce rigid and inefficient TE devices. To overcome these shortcomings, the ANTHEM project aims to develop a robust strategy towards advanced hybrid organic-inorganic TE materials through the novel concept of vapor phase infiltration (VPI). VPI presents a truly novel strategy to fuse state-of-the-art organic-inorganic TE materials at the nanoscaleâ€”opening the possibility for flexible, low cost and even transparent TE materials. Moreover, VPI is an easily scalable vapor-phase process that could extend to a large variety of inorganic/polymer combinations. In this project specific targets will include optimizing the degree of control in scattering engineering, size/ interface composition and spatial distribution of the inorganic phase, key factors for maximizing thermoelectric performance. With an optimal blend of expertise in materials chemistry, characterization and theory from leading European research groups, ANTHEM will deliver a roadmap towards low-cost and abundant hybrid TE materials that incorporate metal oxides, sulfides, or selenides. The success this project has great potential to advance not only the field of VPI, but hybrid TE tooâ€”creating concrete possibilities for the critically important waste-to-energy industry.",2018-10-01,2020-09-30,170121.6,,['waste-to-energy'],1,1

Electromobility is moving forward, driven by drastic cost reductions, higher performances and improved availability to support new business models of autonomous driving passenger cars and new vehicle fleets. 
DEMOBASE falls within this context with the main objectives to cut down development and testing efforts for e-drivetrains at least by a factor 2 and to improve their efficiency by 20%. Safety will be fully managed and new concepts developed for fleet applications.
DEMOBASE is composed of 11 leading European partners with activities ranging from cells to vehicle to recycling. The main gain at vehicle level will come from global optimization taking into account interaction of the different specialties.
Objectives at battery level will be achieved by massive digitalization, substituting the today sequential cell development then battery system development by a parallelization of these activities. This new process can be achieved only using enhanced cells models including safety features to define the cell conception for manufacturing and realizing in the same time frame battery management. 
Objectives at vehicle level will be achieved with a novel approach to design light-weight chassis. It will be demonstrated on a urban demo vehicle that will integrate the advanced battery pack and novels wheel-tire systems with low suspension mass and low rolling resistance.
To secure project deliveries and reinforce collaborations which are an innovation key factor, DEMOBASE will be an original closed-loop project. In a first loop of the EV development, building blocks and their integration processes will be investigated and their efficiency assessed using Key Performance Indicators. Then the most efficient bricks and processes will demonstrate their added value in a second step in 6 months run starting from new high performances cells to operational EV.

1602,767901,MP-ORIF,Innovative biocompatible game changing material for medical implants in trauma,"MMATECH was founded in 2001 to address the challenge of developing better biomaterials for medical devices in orthopaedics. We developed a new engineering modified wear-free biopolymer (MP-1â„¢) for medical devices: dental implants and acetabular liner for hip replacement implants, proved in clinical trials and granted with CE mark. Within MP-ORIF project we will introduce to the market a new game changing Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF) implant made of MP-1TM, called MP-ORIF. This new polyimide polymer will substitute the currently metal orthopaedic implants used in trauma surgery. Orthopaedic fractures are a common acute health issue. A significant increase of bone fractures is foreseen in the coming years due to population aging, more active lifestyle and traffic accidents. All standard metal internal fixator nails have predrilled holes which require a special trained doctor to locate them in the body under Xray to insert the fixation screws. In MP-ORIF the drilling will be produced in the body enabling a robust design without holes, eliminating repeated X-ray imaging which is costly and potentially dangerous. The nail can stay in the body for life-time with no pain caused by outer temperature change. We therefore predict that MP-ORIF will become the gold standard for directly-insert bone fixation in trauma. MP-ORIF will have a significant impact on various levels: (i) market/clients (hospitals, healthcare, doctors): shorter surgery time, higher success rate and an over 50 % lower cost; (ii) end-user (patients): shorter post-operation recovery, greatly reduced scarring; (iii) company: increase in MMATECHâ€™s revenue; (iv) stakeholders: lower public healthcare costs; (v) society: developing economies may gain access to high quality trauma care otherwise impossible. Women will be the major beneficiaries from MP-ORIF project since approximately 80% of the world populations affected by osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and bone injuries are women over 50.",2017-09-01,2020-08-31,1161785.1,,['biopolymer'],1,1

In short, we can mask functional nano- or microparticles by a thin surface coating such that it assumes the properties of the polymer (or environment) in which it should be processed. Thereby, they can be controllably mixed and organized into the polymer, which is essential to give the polymer material better or additional e.g. mechanical and optical properties.

1610,721019,FASTGRID,Cost effective FCL using advanced superconducting tapes for future HVDC grids,"Sustainability of energy systems goes through high penetration of renewable energy with huge volumes of electricity to transmit over long distances. The most advanced solution is the HVDC Supergrid. But fault currents remain an issue even if DC circuit breakers have emerged. These are not satisfying, whereas Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SCFCLs) using REBCO tapes bring an attractive solution. SCFCLs have already proved their outstanding performances in MVAC systems, with a few commercial devices in service. However, present REBCO conductors cannot be readily used at very high voltages: the electrical field under current limitation is too low and leads to too long tapes and high cost. FASTGRID aims to improve and modify the REBCO conductor, in particular its shunt, in order to significantly enhance (2 to 3 times) the electric field and so the economical SCFCL attractiveness. A commercial tape will be upgraded to reach a higher critical current and enhanced homogeneity as compared to todayâ€™s standards. For safer and better operation, the tapeâ€™s normal zone propagation velocity will be increased by at least a factor of 10 using the patented current flow diverter concept. The shunt surface will also be functionalized to boost the thermal exchanges with coolant. This advanced conductor will be used in a smart DC SCFCL module (1 kA â€“ 50 kV). This one will include new functionalities and will be designed as sub-element of a real HVDC device. In parallel to this main line of work, developments will be carried out on a promising breakthrough path: ultra high electric field tapes based on sapphire substrates. FASTGRID will bring this to the next levels of technology readiness.
In conclusion, FASTGRID project aims at improving significantly existing REBCO conductor architecture to make SCFCLs economically attractive for HVDC Supergrids.

The Cross-layer modEl-based fRamework for multi-oBjective dEsign of Reconfigurable systems in unceRtain hybRid envirOnments (CERBERO) project aims at developing a design environment for CPS based of two pillars: a cross-layer model based approach to describe, optimize, and analyze the system and all its different views concurrently; an advanced adaptivity support based on a multi-layer autonomous engine. To overcome the limit of current tools, CERBERO provides: libraries of generic Key Performance Indicators for reconfigurable CPSs in hybrid/uncertain environments; novel formal and simulation-based methods; a continuous design environment guaranteeing early-stage analysis and optimization of functional and non-functional requirements, including energy, reliability and security. CERBERO effectiveness will be assessed in challenging and diverse scenarios, brought by industrial leaders: an embedded CPS with self-healing capabilities for planetary explorations (TASE-S&T), an ocean monitoring CPSoS (AS), and a Smart Travelling CPSoS for Electric Vehicle (TNO-CRF-S&T).

In some systems, in particular latency-sensitive or high availability systems, components are also placed closer to end-users (in, e.g., radio base stations and other systems on the edge of access networks) in order to increase reliability and reduce latency - a style of computing often referred to as edge or fog computing.
However, while recent years have seen significant advances in system instrumentation as well as data centre energy efficiency and automation, computational resources and network capacity are often provisioned using best effort provisioning models and coarse-grained quality of service (QoS) mechanisms, even in state-of-the-art data centres.

DARWIN will improve response to expected and unexpected crises affecting critical infrastructures and social structures. It addresses the management of both man-made events (e.g. cyber-attacks) and natural events (e.g. earthquakes).  

The main objective is the development of European resilience management guidelines. These will improve the ability of stakeholders to anticipate, monitor, respond, adapt, learn and evolve, to operate efficiently in the face of crises. Guidelines will be presented in formats for easy usage and maintenance to avoid them being dust-collectors on a shelf. To enable dynamic, user-friendly guidelines the project will adapt innovative tools (e.g. serious gaming, training packages), test and validate the guidelines, and establish knowledge about how organisations can implement guidelines to improve resilience. 

A multidisciplinary approach is applied, involving experts in the field of resilience, crisis and risk management, social media and service providers in the Air Traffic Management and health care domains. To ensure transnational, cross-sector applicability, long-term relevance and uptake of project results, a Community of Crisis and Resilience Practitioners (CoCRP) will be established, including stakeholders and end-users from other domains and critical infrastructures and resilience experts. The CoCRP will be involved in an iterative evaluation process to provide feedback on the guidelines.

Assessing the gendered impact of industrial logging on well-being in Solomon Islands.,"Women are often negatively affected by industrial logging in tropical forests. They are excluded from decision-making, and are vulnerable to the sexual exploitation, alcoholism and conflict associated with this extractive industry. However, the scientific literature on the impacts of logging on womenâ€™s well-being is fragmented, and the subject receives little attention from policy and industry. This project aims to address this gap by: 1) publishing 3 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact, open-access journals on the gendered impacts of logging in Solomon Islands, based on an innovative combination of ethnographic and quantitative research methods; 2) compiling case studies on women in logging concessions in a special issue of the journal of the European Tropical Forest Research Network; 3) developing a methodological toolkit for the systematic assessment of womenâ€™s well-being in forest concessions. The project results will be further communicated to professional and lay-audiences through oral presentations, policy briefs, newsletters, a website and on-line articles.

This research and training project will consist of an 18-month secondment period at the CGIAR-Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR, Indonesia), and a 12-month return phase at the Institute for Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology of Leiden University (CAOS-LU, The Netherlands).

1617,648779,MaTissE,Magnetic approaches for Tissue Mechanics and Engineering,"'While magnetic nanomaterials are increasingly used as clinical agents for imaging and therapy, their use as a tool for tissue engineering opens up challenging perspectives that have rarely been explored. Lying at the interface between biophysics and nanomedicine, and based on magnetic techniques, the proposed project aims to magnetically design functional tissues and to explore the tissular fate of nanomaterials. Magnetic nanoparticles will be safely introduced into therapeutic cells, thus allowing them to be remotely manipulated by external magnets. 3D manipulations of the magnetized cells (patented in 2012) will be used to form tissues with a controlled size and shape through the development of a unique magnetic bioreactor.  In a self-integrating all-in-one process, 3D tissue will be shaped from cellular 'bricks' without the need for a scaffold. The magnetic tissue will be amenable to mechanical stimulation and in situ imaging at each step of its maturation. The project is inherently multidisciplinary:
1) From a biophysics standpoint, controlled tissue stimulation, forced cell alignment, and mapping of cell-cell forces, will be used to answer pressing questions on the role of physical stresses in cell and tissue functions, such as differentiation.
2) From a regenerative medicine standpoint, this magnetic technology will be applied to cartilage and cardiac tissue repair.

Our most recent contribution was the use of nanomaterial targets for more intense and reliable beam production, and laser ion sources for their purification (discovery of yet unknown 233Francium).
Radioisotopes are widely used for functional imaging in medicine, based on 99mTechnetium or on 18Fluorine. This field is expected to rapidly expand, when coupling imaging with new cancer treatments, with isotopes emitting different type of radioactivity, e.g. alpha particles. This is shown with the recently introduced 223Radium chloride (XofigoÂ®) used as a treatment drug in advanced bone cancers. However, either shortage in the supply of 99mTechnetium or lack of access to new radioisotope with adequate properties is a severe treat to develop personalized treatment that combine functional imaging and therapy.
Ovarian cancers have poor prognosis, are the second most frequent cancer for women and one of the deadliest. They are difficult to treat, because of possible presence of metastasis, and because this region is difficult to irradiate without collateral damages.
MEDICIS-PROMED will train a new generation of scientists to develop systems for personalized Medicine combining functional imaging and treatments based on radioactive ion beam mass-separation. This will be done across a coherent intersectorial multidisciplinary network with world-leading scientists in their field.

The main goal of the STEP_BY_STEP is to maximize the number of households in a given area that significantly change their behaviour at home. Desired behaviour change includes reduced electricity consumption and the investment in energy efficient products and/or high quality renewable energy products.
Communication strategies involving direct contact are typically more effective on behavioural change than mass media campaigns. Thus, a system will be put into place to make individual door-to-door contact with 80% of the households in a given area.
Contrary to traditional door-to-door canvassing, often seen as a one-shot deal, our project solicits targeted households regularly through email or by phone and accompanies them over a 20 month period towards the adoption of energy-saving practices.
To reduce the attitude-behaviour gap, our system uses proven communication techniques that push towards action. Households are regularly encouraged to try new ecological gestures adapted to their level of motivation. Feedback is given and social norms are used.
Community-based social marketing strategies will be used to encourage energy-related investment decisions. Households likely to take individual investment decisions will be motivated to take such decisions benefiting from economies of scale and facilitated by other householdsâ€™ experience. Institutional partners will launch their energy saving interventions amongst 9000 households in 4 European areas that represent diverse populations and communities.

Enhanced loading of surface water with P is the main cause for eutrophication and presents a key challenge in meeting the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. P-TRAP targets both problems and develops new methods and approaches to trap P in drained agricultural areas and in the sediments of eutrophic lakes. Trapping of P involves the application of iron(Fe)-containing by-products from drinking water treatment. P-TRAP aspires the ideas of a circular economy and aims at recovering the retained P in agricultural systems. Novel microbial technologies will be developed to convert P-loaded Fe-minerals into marketable fertilizers whose suitability will be evaluated. The new P-TRAP technologies have in common that they rely on the naturally strong connection between P and Fe and the innovative P-TRAP strategies will be underpinned by process-orientated investigations on the behavior of P during the transformation of Fe minerals. The latter are key in trapping and recycling of P in agricultural systems and lakes. P-TRAP establishes a framework of partners from multiple science and engineering disciplines. Integration of non-academic partners from various stakeholder groups into the P-TRAP consortium paves the way for direct implementation of the acquired knowledge. P-TRAP provides Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) an environment for conducting innovative scientific research by using state-of-the-art methodology. Training through P-TRAP increases the ESRsâ€™ mobility between sectors, cultures, and nations and strengthens their responsibility to exploiting scientific results for societal and economical benefit.

1623,801221,NEWTON-g,New Tools for Terrain Gravimetry,"Poor knowledge of the spatio-temporal changes in the characteristics and distribution of subsurface fluids remains an insurmountable barrier to addressing important societal issues, including: sustainable management of energy resources (e.g., hydrocarbons and geothermal energy), management of water resources, and assessment of hazard (e.g., volcanic eruptions). Gravimetry is highly attractive because it can detect changes in subsurface mass, thus providing a window into processes that involve deep fluids. However, high cost and operating features associated with current instrumentation seriously limits the practical field use of gravimetry. 
NEWTON-g proposes a radical change of paradigm for gravimetry to overcome such limitations. We aim at developing a field-compatible gravity imager able to real-time monitor the evolution of the subsurface mass changes through continuous images of the gravity field. This system will include an array of low-costs MEMS-based relative gravimeters anchored on an absolute quantum gravimeter. The adjustable position, grid and shape of the array of sensors and the continuous logging of the gravimeters will provide imaging of gravity changes, associated with variations in subsurface fluid properties, with unparalleled spatio-temporal resolution. 
Specific work will be carried out to ruggedize the devices for field operation. We will deploy the new gravity imager at Etna volcano (Italy), where frequent gravity fluctuations, easy access to the active structures and the presence of a multiparameter monitoring system (including traditional gravimeters) ensure an excellent natural laboratory for testing the new tools. Insights from the new gravity imager will be used for volcanic hazards analysis, to demonstrate the importance of gravity to problems of societal relevance.

Increasingly, modern technology is addressing problems where fluid transport takes place in sub-micron sized channels, or in pores. The physical laws of transport in such channels are qualitatively different from those that determine bulk flow; they are poorly understood and, importantly, barely exploited.  The aim of the proposed research is to lay the basis for an entire novel technology where thermal gradients and concentration gradients along nano-sized channels are harnessed to drive devices that have no equivalent on the macroscopic scale.  
Such gradient-driven surface flows  offer a huge scope for fundamental advances with very significant technological implications. We envisage breakthroughs in the area of energy extraction from salinity gradients (`blue energyâ€™), ultra-filtration and desalination, and the development of novel, highly sensitive protein-separation devices. This new approach will surpass the intrinsic limitations of current technologies. The expected huge improvement in efficiency will be a game changer and will break the current barriers in the development of technologies such as e.g osmotic energy harvesting.

The project will not only produce a nitrates and phosphate concentrate available for use as organic fertiliser in agriculture, but its novelty rests on the use of an innovative fermentative process designed for sludge valorisation which results in a hydrolysed sludge (with a multiplied Biomethane Potential) and biostimultants products, with low development costs and high added value in plant nutrition and agriculture.
This process is complemented by proven technologies such as biological aeration systems, membrane technologies, anaerobic processes for bio-methane production and algal technologies, all combined in a zero-waste-emission and an integrated monitoring control tool that will improve the quality of data on nutrient flows. The project will close the loop by demonstrating the benefits associated with nutrients recycling through the implementation of different business models for each final product.

As a summary, Water2REturn project adopts a Circular Economy approach where nutrients present in wastewaters from the meat industry can be recycled and injected back into the agricultural system as new raw materials.

One technology that can address both of these important challenges is energy-efficient lighting. In this context, considerable research efforts devoted towards the development of Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED)-based lighting and electronic devices, in part due to their much lower power consumption and greater efficiency compared to other lighting technologies. According to Transparent Mark Research the global OLED displays market is expected to reach $100 billion by 2050 from $4.9 billion in 2012. Europe has been at the forefront of OLED-based research with companies having invested significantly in this technology. Although, OLEDs are already commercialized, the devices were fabricated by expensive vacuum. To achieve a truly cost-effective product, devices must be fabricated via solution processing.

Open porosity of the cathode, interactions between host matrices and polysulphides and proper solvatation of polysulphides turned to be important for complete utilisation of sulphur, however with this approach didnâ€™t result long term cycling.

Instability of lithium metal in most of conventional electrolytes and formation of dendrites due to uneven distribution of lithium upon the deposition cause several difficulties. Safety problems connected with dendrites and low coulombic efficiency with a constant increase of inner resistance due to electrolyte degradation represent main technological challenges. From this point of view, stabilisation of lithium metal will have an impact on safety issues.

The charge and excited state dynamics do not only depend on the properties of individual molecules but are to a large extent determined by the interactions between multiple molecules. By careful engineering of the properties of individual molecules and of the way they aggregate in the solid crystalline state it is in principle possible to design materials that exhibit a specific functionality. Examples of this are materials that are optimized to give high charge carrier mobilities and high exciton diffusion coefficients. It is also possible to design more complex functionality. An example of this is singlet exciton fission, a process by which one singlet excited state transforms into a combination of two triplet states. This spin-allowed process can in principle increase the efficiency of organic solar cells by a factor 1.5. A second example is upconversion of low energy photons into higher energy photons. This is possible by combining two low-energy triplet excited states into a single singlet excited state by triplet-triplet annihilation. Finally, it is possible gain control over charge separation on the interface of two different materials to increase the charge separation efficiency in photovoltaic cells.

In this work, we will explore ways to achieve control of charge and exciton dynamics in a combined effort including organic synthesis, computational chemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy and conductivity experiments.

Today, unused carbon resources are widely available and most of the time wasted.The C123 projectâ€™s main goal is the validation in a relevant environment (TRL5) of an efficient and selective transformation of current generally accessible, unexploited, cheap methane resources (stranded gas (CH4) and biogas (CH4\CO2)) to propylene in particular and C3 products in general.
To this aim, C123 will develop new catalytic materials in novel process configurations and related operating procedures allowing the conversion of these resources to propylene through Oxidative Conversion of Methane, leading to an ethylene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen mixture with an optimised composition for further HydroFormylation into propanal and/or propanol, ultimately being dehydrated into propylene, either in an integrated manner or as a stand-alone step.
C123 will adopt an integrated approach, not studying each step separately but considering the process as a whole, optimising recycling, avoiding separation, using variable feedstocks, and increasing resource and carbon efficiency.
The process will be evaluated and validated for implementation both as decentralised localised units (~10 kt/y) â€“ the modular route, and in existing large facilities (>140 kt/y) â€“the add-on route.

1637,867843,Waterjade,Waterjade: the global platform to predict water resources,"'Water is called the new gold of the 21st century, yet, due to climate change, water resources are becoming ever more discontinuous, creating hazardous sitations and big uncertainties in numerous sectors, like energy, where water is the primary ingredient for daily operations.
One of the most recurrent question raised by professionals is: 'how much water is there and when will it become available'? 
We have developed a new technology, called Waterjade, capable of predicting water resources at high resolution, both in terms of snow and river discharge. Differently from other competitive technologies, it adopts a physically based modeling approach that integrates multiple sources of data, like in-situ stations, numerical weather predictions and satellite data. The advantages are increased accuracy and scalability to ungauged basins. 
Our customers are hydropower companies, whom we deliver a service of snow monitoring upstream the production plants, so they can quantify the energy that is likely to be produced in the long run, and a service of short-term inflow predictions to the plants, useful for safety reason and to optimize the energy production. We are extending the service of snow monitoring also to the public sector, that use it for safety reasons (avalanches) and as an index to anticipate drought.
Working with public and private sectors is giving positive feedback, both in terms of credibility and accuracy as we can benefit from the capillary distribution of in-situ stations from public agencies.
The business model is a 'subscription-based Service' to the Waterjade portal and the market potential is estimated in about 500 Mâ‚¬/y worldwide, with great potential in particular for hydropower, Europe's and worldâ€™s largest renewable energy resource.

The improvement will be supported upgrading Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete with new functionalities. Focus will be on marine structures and infrastructures for geothermal/biomass energy plants, whose severe conditions challenge the performance, lead to quick deterioration and shorten the lifespan, resulting in billions Euro spent each year in repairs.
This goal will be achieved through the following activities (variations compared to current reinforced concrete):
- Tailoring UHDC to target a 100% enhancement in material durability.
- Upgrading experimental methods to validating durability properties of UHDCs in service conditions (cracked state) and validate an enhancement of at least a 30%.
- Developing a theoretical model to evaluate ageing and degradation of UHDC structures in EAE with a 75% of accuracy, extending the modelling to predict the lifespan.
- Proposing new design concepts DAD, for the use of UHDC and assessing the structures durability and Life Cycle Analysis with a 95% confidence level, to achieve an increase service life of 30%, and a long-term reduction of maintenance costs by at least 50%.
- Proving, through long-term monitoring in six full-scale proofs-of concept that UHDC in real conditions has the expected enhancement of 30% in durability for both: repaired and new elements.
- Developing a Business Plan per industrial partner analyzing the market niches and sectors where the developments will be exploited.

1642,734141,PJ16 CWP HMI,Controller Working Position / Human Machine Interface - CWP/HMI,"PJ.16 project aims to reduce development and operating costs of Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP). These savings will ultimately benefit airlines and their customers. It achieves this by delivering the ATM Master Plan goals (defined by the European Air Traffic Management (ATM) community) for a more efficient deployment of human resources,  a progressive increase in automation support, the implementation of virtualisation technologies and  the use of standardised and interoperable systems whilst increasing the safety level. 

Within the PJ16 proposal, there are two innovative solutions:
The first solution develops a concept for separating the Controller Working Position (CWP) from the datacentre where the data is produced. This lean and efficient use of ANSP infrastructure tackles the issues presented by fragmented European ATM systems and country-specific architectures, enabling Europe to move to an interoperable, cost-effective and flexible service provision infrastructure. Decoupling of the CWPs should enable a more efficient use of the most valuable and expensive resource, the human. By enabling increased flexibility the ANSPs should better manage staffing for prevailing traffic conditions and assure service continuity. 

The second solution deals with new methods of controller interaction with the Human Machine Interface (HMI), applying mature technologies from other domains to ATM. This will increase controller productivity, reduce workload, stress level and enable the use of SESAR advanced tools, safely facilitating performance based operations. Furthermore, the use of modern thin client technology and the processes for developing HMI solutions are investigated, aiming at more efficient CWP development and operation.

To do this, FLOW will create a link between (currently poorly-connected) walking and cycling and congestion by developing a user-friendly methodology for evaluating the ability of walking and cycling measures to reduce congestion. 
FLOW will develop assessment tools to allow cities to evaluate effects of walking and cycling measures on congestion. Our aim is for the tools to become the standard for assessing the impact of walking and cycling measures on congestion. The tools include a congestion impact assessment (including socio-economic impact, an assessment of soft measures, congestion evaluation based on KPIs and a cost benefit analysis) and traffic modelling. Current modelling software will be calibrated and customised in FLOW partner cities to analyse the relationship of cyclist and pedestrian movements to congestion.
The modelling and impact assessment will identify the congestion reducing effect of walking and cycling measures. FLOW partner cities will develop implementation scenarios and action plans for adding or up-scaling measures that are shown to reduce congestion. FLOW will target three distinct audiences, with appropriate materials and messaging for each. Cities will learn about the value and use of new transport modelling tools, businesses will be made aware of the potential market in congestion busting products and services and decision makers will be provided with facts to argue for walking and cycling to be put on equal footing with other modes of transport. FLOW will meet the challenge of â€œsignificantly reducing urban road congestion and improving the financial and environmental sustainability of urban transportâ€ by improving the understanding of walking and cycling measures that have potential to reduce urban congestion.",2015-05-01,2018-04-30,3781696.0,,['non-motorised'],1,1

The successful accomplishment of the emission reduction target by 2050, involves the need to increase the rate of retrofitting of the inefficient building stock up to 2.9%. In order to increase the renovation rate, more efficient renovation processes from design to manufacturing phase are needed. The use of prefabricated modules for renovation reduces on-site works, installation time, works intrusiveness, minimising the consumption of raw material; however there is a need to define holistic methodologies to adapt prefabrication processes to individual renovation solutions as well as to mass production, linked to computer design tools. 
Giving answer to the mentioned needs BERTIM will provide: (1) High energy performance prefabricated modules for deep renovation, integrating windows, insulation materials, collective HVAC systems, renewable energy systems and energy supply systems. The modules will be based in timber and recyclable materials for a low carbon foot print. The assembly system will guarantee a very little time in the installation and low disturbance to tenants. (2) An innovative holistic renovation process methodology based on a digital workflow from design to installation phase. In order to support the renovation process, a renovation project design tool oriented to SME integrating BIM with CAD/CAM tools and assuring the interoperability with CNC machines for mass manufacturing processes will be developed and implemented in three industrial settings.

In ordar to tackle this challenge we are proposing a novel way to improve the UV stability of thermally modified wood using nano based stabilizers. But instead of coating nanoparticles on heat treated wood, wood surfaces will be treated with nanoparticle (ZnO or CeO2) solutions, thereby forming protective envelope on a wooden surface, which will be further heat treated under controlled  temperature and time.

Global R&D manages to increase the energy density of Li-Ion batteries by about 3% every year. At LeydenJar Technologies, we pioneer a process to increase the energy density by 50% without compromising on costs, safety, and lifetime. The key aspect of our innovation is a novel anode manufactured using Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD), a technology already established in the photovoltaic industry. Our innovation is at TRL 7 and it has proven performances comparable to state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries and potential to exceed them by far.  We have patented the core aspects of our innovation worldwide, built a strong team, and defined a business case with the stakeholders in the value chain. Our anodes will be a breakthrough in the world of Li-ion batteries, allowing portable devices to last 50% longer and electric vehicles to drive 50% more, so the infrastructure of charging stations will need to be much less dense. Our innovation is very important for Europe, since the EC is making a huge effort to build a local battery industry that can compete with the Asian one. The market of Li-ion batteries will exceed â‚¬90 billion of turnover in 2025. To become a major player in it, during the Phase 2 project we will finalize our technology and production process, build a demo machine that exceeds in throughput the one we own now, and validate our anodes with an external battery manufacturer.

Beads discovered in burials from major Near Eastern and Nubian archaeological sites will be analysed through a microwear approach complemented by geochemical analyses. For the first time in the field of stone ornaments, high-precision surface texture analysis will be applied using the technique of the Confocal Scanning Microscopy (CSM) and metrology software. The â€œbiographiesâ€ of the archaeological beads (manufacturing techniques, modalities of uses including accidents, repairing or recycling events) will be reconstructed through microtopographic analyses and comparisons with ethnographic and experimental references. A challenging experimental collection of references will be created as stone bead preforms will first document several drilling and finishing techniques, and then be subject to different scenarios of uses. The ethnographic material available are carnelian beads produced by traditional workshops in Yemen and India. To address the place of semi-precious stone beads within the Neolithic societies, the quality of production (levels of technicity) and maintenance will be assessed and statistically compared with well-defined chronocultural contexts and biological data available for the individuals wearing the ornaments (age, sex).

Building Automation (BA) systems, as compared to CR, can result in medium energy use reductions and in low or medium harvesting from RES at the expense of medium installation costs and medium operational costs. Recently, the concept of Adaptable/Dynamic Building Envelopes (ADBE) - such as Multifunctional FaÃ§ade Modules - has been proposed towards overcoming many of the shortcomings of CR and BA. ADBE systems can result in high energy use reductions and high harvesting from RES at the expense of medium-to-high installation costs and medium operational costs. The main strategic goal of the PLUG-N-HARVEST proposal is to design, develop, demonstrate and exploit a new modular, plug-n-play concept/product for ADBE - deployable to both residential and non-residential buildings - which is able to provide high (maximum possible) energy use reductions and high (maximum possible) energy harvesting from RES both at the single-building and the district scale while requiring medium-to-low installation costs and almost-zero operational costs. Moreover, by appropriately exploiting its attributes, the PLUG-N-HARVEST system will be designed and implemented considering circular economy principles, which will allow implementing new business models based on leasing and renting modes and, by this, leaving the door open to massive implementations.

The novelty is in the surface finish of diamond rolling elements and mating raceways which can be improved substantially relative to todayâ€™s metallic bearing materials such that heat generation and frictional wear is minimized. Diamond offers superior thermal properties enabling thermal gradients and running clearances to be optimized.

This proposal aims to reduce oil system cost, weight and complexity by exploiting the properties of synthetic diamond material in the design and manufacture of novel bearings. The basic premise is that the surface finish of diamond rolling elements and mating raceways can be improved substantially relative to todayâ€™s metallic bearing materials such that heat generation and frictional wear is minimized. Diamondâ€™s superior thermal properties enable thermal gradients and running clearances to be optimized using air rather than oil as the cooling medium.

A sustainable land-use strategy in and around the port and a strategic transition to new, service-based, management models that improve capacity and efficiency are paramount. They are key enablers for ports that want to keep pace with the ocean carriers needs and establish themselves as trans-shipment hubs with a â€˜societal license to operateâ€™; for ports whose land strategy, hinterland accessibility and operations are underpinned by circular economy principles. COREALIS proposes a strategic, innovative framework, supported by disruptive technologies, including IoT, data analytics, next generation traffic management and 5G,for modern ports to handle future capacity, traffic, efficiency and environmental challenges. It respects their limitations regarding the port land, intermodal infrastructure and terminal operation. It proposes beyond state of the art innovations to increase efficiency and optimize land-use, while being financially viable, respecting circular economy and being of service to the city. Through COREALIS, the port will minimize its environmental footprint to the city, it will decrease disturbance to local population through a reduction in the congestion around the port. It will be a pillar of business innovation, promoting local startups in disruptive technologies of mutual interest. COREALIS innovations are key both for the major deep sea European ports in view of the new mega-vessel era, but also relevant for medium sized ports with limited investment funds for infrastructure and automation.",2018-05-01,2021-04-30,5150540.0,,['traffic management'],1,1

The CORUS (Concept of Operation for EuRopean UTM Systems) project gathers experts from aviation (manned and drone), research and academia to develop a reference Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for UTM (UAS Traffic Management) in VLL airspace in Europe.
Building on the state-of-the-art, CORUS will develop an operational concept enabling safe interaction between all airspace users in VLL considering contingencies and societal issues. Specifically CORUS will:
1. Establish a CONOPS for nominal situations, developing use cases for major scenarios
2. Address drones operations in the vicinity of airfields and controlled airspace and for transfer between controlled and non-controlled airspaces.
3. Describe how losses of safety in non-nominal drone situations can be minimized.
4. Examine non-aviation aspects, identifying key issues for society and offering solutions to ease social acceptance
5. Identify necessary technical developments, quantifying the level of safety and performance required

Platinum Group Materials (PGMs), contained in this list, are among the least abundant of the Earth's elements and were classified as materials whose substitution is currently extremely difficult and recycling rate is very low. The supply of PGMs (Europe is the main importer) is currently ensured mostly by primary sources (72%) coming from both mines and recycled products (no mines in Europe), and it cannot meet the global demand (current deficit 20 tonnes). PGMs demand (up to 80%) is driven mainly by the emission control catalysts market which is expected to reach â‚¬6 billion by 2019.
The PROMETHEUS project will bring to the market a disruptive innovation, allowing for the first time to substitute up to 60% of PGMs used in autocatalysts with copper nanoparticles, while keeping the same performances and durability. Specifically the PROMETHEUS project objectives are:
1. Industrialising PROMETHEUS production and demonstrate on large scale its performances. PROMETHEUS has already been validated in the real environment with a key stakeholder (FIAT, Large multinational automotive industry) also supporting Phase 2;
2. Substituting 67% of PGMs used in autocatalysts with copper nanoparticles, saving up to 40 tonnes of PGMs per year, 2 times the current global deficit;
3. Decoupling Europe from a Critical Raw Material (PGMs), saving up to 60% of PGMs European demand per year (20 tonnes per year â€“ the current global demand/supply deficit);
4. Boosting European automotive and emission control catalyst markets. Copper costs ~6,800 times less than Platinum (4.5â‚¬/Kg against 30,550 â‚¬/Kg) which means that European industries can save almost â‚¬250 mln to be reinvested in RD&I and job growth.

The range of products to be launched on the market in June 2019 comprises of two different sized turbine devices, 25Kw and 60Kw respectively, which are specifically designed to cater to a niche, â€˜low-powerâ€™, small-scale energy generation market.

DP Renewables stems from the success of â€˜HydroKinetic-25â€™, the SME Instrument Phase 1 project implemented by DesignPro in March-September 2016 that served to prove this innovative ideaâ€™s economic viability and define a business plan to bring it to market. Phase 2 will see this strategic and validated business plan implemented and the realisation of a project that will have significant positive impact on societal, economic and environmental issues. The project will cater to those with a suitable deployment site, meeting their need for energy security and independence, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions. 

The project is fully aligned with the growth strategy of the SME and is regarded as a major stepping-stone towards consolidating its international presence while becoming a recognised contributor to the renewable energy spectrum. Despite its large resource potential, hydrokinetic energy is still largely untapped with only 5% exploited to date. Europe, as well as many countries around the world, is rich of small and medium-sized rivers and straits between islands. Existing technologies require very fast flow speeds and large deployment spaces in order to make turbine outputs viable. This cuts off a large majority of the available market from having a feasible solution to use. Our project, DP Renewables, offers this solution, enabling Europe and the world to utilise an abundant, highly accessible resource by harnessing cost-efficient, clean and reliable energy for users.",2017-07-01,2019-09-30,1934656.5,,['renewable energy'],1,1
1662,766649,ECOSHEET-PRO,An Eco-Innovative Alternative to Plywood,"ECOSHEET-PRO is an eco-innovative and cost effective alternative to plywood made from mixed plastic waste, suitable for
high strength applications in the construction industry. This project will tackle two significant environmental challenges facing
Europe, whilst also offering added value to the construction industry.
The first issue addressed is that of mixed plastic waste. In Europe, in 2014, 18 million tonnes of post-consumer waste
plastics were landfilled or incinerated, as they could not be easily separated and recycled. Alternative uses for such waste
must be found.
The second issue is the growth in the use of plywood, typically manufactured from slow-growing, tropical hardwoods. This
material is a key, high volume commodity in construction industry formworks and an area the size of Madrid is deforested
each year to meet Europeâ€™s demand.
ECOSHEET-PRO transforms mixed plastic that would otherwise be wasted into a competitive, reusable, plywood
replacement. Previous attempts to create such boards have failed to deliver the required strength or cost effectiveness
required by industry. We have overcome these barriers through an innovative manufacturing process, which will be scaled
up and refined during this project.
ECOSHEET-PRO has the potential to re-define the â‚¬1.8 billion European plywood industry and help Europe meet its
demanding plastic recycling targets, contributing to the circular economy. Our success stems from bringing together the
complementary expertise of two eco-innovative SMEs from Italy and the UK, both with a strong ambition to grow and
internationalise.
Across a network of 13 facilities in 2023, ECOSHEET-PRO will create 77 jobs, generate annual revenues of over â‚¬76.5

However, intelligent transport systems that provide real-time data cost millions of euros for road sensor deployment. GPS aggregators like Google Maps and Inrix are inexpensive but can miss up to 50% of real time traffic jams, and do not represent population segments proportionally, which is essential to transportation planning. Cellular network location data is now ubiquitous and cheap, but it is imprecise due to the range of cellular antenna coverage.

Cellint uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process cellular network location data for optimized transportation management. Our patented technology tracks phones on a mobile network passively and anonymously, pinpointing their locations on any mode of transportation. The result is a virtual sensor network that provides real-time sensor-quality traffic data at a fraction of the cost of sensor systems. Our origin-destination data is so accurate that it can identify the root causes of specific transit congestions.

Our technology is unparalleled in its performance and cost-effectiveness. However, we manually process the data that our transport authority clients require. Preparing customized reports based on this comprehensive data can take weeks or months. This has created a serious bottleneck for us, and is restricting our growth.

In this project we will upgrade and integrate our current solutions into a single automated transportation information platform with advanced analysis and visualization features, with results provided in minutes instead of months. We will launch 4 modules: 1) Real-time traffic management, 2) Ongoing transportation management, 3) Real-time crowd management, and 4) Parking management.

Electric vehicles (EV) are emerging as the future of transport as they break the dependence on fossil fuels and offer significant advantages in terms of noise and local air pollution. However, uptake has been poor so far due to range anxiety. As a result, while 44% of drivers consider emissions & environmental friendliness as important factors when buying a car, only 5% would consider buying an electric car due to range concerns. 

Automotive manufacturers have addressed this issue through the installation of range extender engines. However, existing extenders tend to be too large with poor power density, limiting their use in small commercial and domestic vehicles where space is at a premium.. The clear business opportunity is to provide tier 1 automotive powertrain providers and OEMs with breakthrough innovation in EV range extender technology that significantly improves power density whilst providing  high efficiency, low emissions, low noise and low vibration to meet consumer needs. 

Our solution, CREEV, takes the inherent advantages of rotary (Wankel) type engines for such compact applications and applies patent protected innovations to overcome efficiency and reliability issues to deliver an engine exactly matched to OEM needs.

Our breakthrough solution is lab tested/demonstrated. The Phase 1 feasibility study report has already been accepted and this DSI Phase 2 funding application builds on this success. 

With the market for EVs in Europe growing 1300% in the last 2 years, CREEV offers a market opportunity worth an estimated â‚¬79m over 6 years.

The next revolution will be brought by a new generation of extensively modified â€œenzymaticâ€ catalysts working in non-natural environments, possibly build from non-natural chemistries and targeting an unlimited range of non-natural functions. However, their design is still an arduous process; computational design lacks precision while the combinatorial approach, directed evolution, is limited by labor-intensive or ad hoc selection stages.

We will remove the selection bottleneck in directed evolution by introducing biochemical computers able to perform this step autonomously. Based on recent developments in DNA-based molecular programming, these molecular scouts will be co-compartmentalized with genetic libraries into billions of individual compartments in micrometric emulsions. At each generation and in each droplet, after expression of the genotype, these molecular programs will autonomously: i- evaluate the phenotypic signature of a candidate, ii- integrate this information into a predefined scoring function and iii- propagate the relevant genetic information according to this score.

The programmability of this approach will make directed evolution versatile, faster, and able to address more challenging problems. The evolution dynamics itself become tunable, offering new perspectives on the fitness landscape of biopolymer catalysts. A quantitative in silico model will be built and integrated in a computer-assisted tool for the fast set-up of in vitro experiments and tuning of the various experimental knobs.

Much of the investment in energy efficiency & renewable energy production has been based on project funding & there is an underexploited opportunity to achieve more systematic and progressive improvements through embedding PPI methodologies within the ongoing processes for the procurement of energy-intensive goods & services.   CEPPI will demonstrate, through an action learning process, how forthcoming public tenders can be influenced to achieve a more sustainable energy outcome & build capacity amongst management & procurement professionals.
The project will build on established relationships that have been developed between the five participating cities (Birmingham, Budapest, Castellon, Valencia, Wroclaw) through the Climate KIC.   They will be mentored (by leading PPI and sustainable energy experts) through an action learning process that will build the short term knowledge and PPI capacity to reduce annual energy consumption by at least 33GWh.  Energy & procurement foresight activities will provide the strategic direction to become both procurement & technological leaders for sustainable, energy-efficient cities.   At least 80  individuals across the 5 cities will be introduced to innovation procurement methods.",2015-04-01,2018-07-31,1294808.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

1675,646742,INCANA,Insect-inspired capillary nanostamping,"Aim of the proposed project is a) development and establishment of insect-inspired capillary nanostamping (IICN) as next-generation contact nanolithography, b) replacing state-of-the-art lithographic and synthesis protocols requiring use of sacrificial templates or time-consuming self-assembly steps by IICN and c) significant IICN-driven acceleration and upscaling of the production of extended nanostructured systems. To meet these aims, IICN stamp design will be inspired by insect feet depositing small secretion droplets through arrays of hairy contact elements on counterpart surfaces. Monolithic IICN stamps extending cm2 will consist of spongy ink-filled substrates connected to extended arrays of spongy nanoscale dispensing elements with diameters in the 100 nm range (density up to ~130 dispensing elements per square micron). Ink supplied through the spongy pore systems forms capillary bridges between each dispensing element and counterpart surfaces, thus enabling massively parallel capillary bridge-guided nanorod synthesis. Capillary bridge rupture during stamp retraction leads to massively parallel lithographic deposition of ink nanodroplet arrays (target nanodroplet volume: a few 10 zeptolitres). IICN model applications include production of a) ultrathin nanoporous membranes for separation; b) ordered silicon nanostructures by IICN-supported metal-assisted etching; c) nearly-ergodic arrays of encapsulated liquid nanocontainers for massively parallel ensemble nanochemistry or ensemble tracing of single molecules; d) nearly-ergodic biochips for massively parallel analyte detection with single-molecule resolution. As example for substitution of time-consuming self-assembly in nanomaterial synthesis by IICN, IICN-accelerated production of ordered nanoporous alumina will be studied. To pave the way for upscaling and potential commercialization of IICN, high-throughput IICN devices for automated operation in batch and continuous roller modes will be constructed.",2015-09-01,2020-08-31,1918000.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,1

researchers (ESRs) who will contribute to the design and implementation of eco-friendly and sustainable next-generation (5G) networks and become leaders in the related scientific, technological, and industrial initiatives. Sustainable networks are
based on the premise that environmental energy can be scavenged through dedicated harvesting hardware so as to power 5G base stations (BSs) and the end devices (mobile terminals, sensors and machines). To realise this vision, the project will take a complete approach, encompassing the characterisation of intermittent and/or erratic energy sources, the development of theoretical models, and the design, optimisation and proof-of-concept implementation of core network, BS and mobile elements as well as their integration with the smart electrical grid. 
The consortium is composed of world-class research centres and companies that are in the forefront of mobile communication and renewable energy research and technology development. The attitude of the industrial partners towards the strong investment in R&D and their strategic vision are fully aligned with the mission of this project, making them perfectly fit for this consortium. This grants a well-balanced project with genuine and strong technical interactions.

1677,699884,QUAFORD,Towards a Worldwide Quantification of Forest Degradation,"The global C emissions trading system currently focuses on reducing deforestation and forest degradation. Under the UN-REDD\ program, donor countries can compensate for some of their C emissions by implementing projects that will reduce C emissions by a known amount in developing countries. Operationally, only C emissions due to deforestation are being estimated in REDD\ projects due to the lack of definition of forest degradation and of thresholds for distinguishing between forest degradation and disturbance due to sustainable forest management practices. No worldwide estimates of the extent of forest degradation have yet been made, and large amounts of C emissions may occur in some degraded areas still being classified as forests. The overall scientific objective of this proposal is to produce an operational definition of forest degradation in the context of REDD\ projects. A new approach that considers a single reference condition (but dependent on site conditions) for assessing the occurrence and extent of forest degradation will be developed. The Researcher has experience in forest inventory and REDD\; however, advanced biometric modelling techniques are needed to accomplish the research objectives. The Supervisor is an internationally recognised expert in this field, and the Host institution (University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) has a long tradition in hosting researchers and in international collaboration. The candidate will broaden his capacities in complementary skills through a customized Personal Development Career Plan, which will enhance his future career as an independent researcher. The Researcher will carry out a three-month research stay at the Forestry Division of FAO (Rome), which is an end-user of the expected results.

1678,700745,Topological-Plasmonics,Robust light manipulation in plasmonic nanostructures assisted by topological protection,"Materials that present plasmonic resonances feature the unique capability of confining light in nanometer-scale volumes. Resonant metal nanostructures, such as gold or silver nanoparticles, support localized surface plasmon resonances upon light illumination. These are free electron oscillations coupled to the electromagnetic field that enable light concentration even beyond the diffraction limit. For this reason plasmonics is a key tool for guiding and focusing light in order to extend the use of optical techniques into the nanoscale, with current and potential applications ranging from ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensor devices to imaging, non-linear optics or enhanced light absorption in photovoltaic cells.

On the other hand, the study of topological phases and protected states in solid state systems as well as in photonic crystals has been very successful in recent years, since electronic or photonic states protected by the global symmetries of the system can propagate without suffering from scattering at defects or disorder. This has raised interest both from a fundamental point of view, with new physics being developed and understood â€“such as topological insulatorsâ€“, as well as with views to applied technologies, which would greatly benefit from dissipation-free transport of electrons or photons. 

While the field of plasmonics has reached a mature state, the performance of some plasmonic devices is affected by ohmic losses in the metal and fabrication defects. Novel and improved functionalities are needed in order to design efficient plasmonic devices. This research aims at adding novel capabilities to the field of plasmonics by designing topologically protected light modes sustained by plasmonic nanostructures. I will study periodic two-dimensional arrangements of metal nanoantennas (metasurfaces) as promising nanostructures to support topologically protected modes with applications in light manipulation in the nanoscale.",2016-05-01,2018-09-03,183454.8,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

The main specific objectives of the proposed action are:
1. To define technical, financial, legal and administrative specifications of a package of investments that are economically sustainable and attractive for private investors;
2. To assess a PPP scheme and to define an EPC model for the energy efficiency of public buildings, also to create better condition to renewal this aged (> 30 years) buildings;

This forms part of the long-term Blue Growth (BG) strategy to support sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors as a whole; something which is at the heart of the Integrated Maritime Policy, the EU Innovation Union, and the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable growth.
Within the Blue Economy, there are new and emerging sectors comprising technologies that are early stage and novel. These are referred to as Blue Growth sectors and they have developed independently for the most part without pursuing cooperation opportunities with other sectors. MARIBE investigates cooperation opportunities (partnerships, joint ventures etc.) for companies within the four key BG sectors in order to develop these companies and their sectors and to promote the multi-use of space in the offshore economy. The sectors are Marine Renewable Energy, Aquaculture, Marine Biotechnology and Seabed Mining. MARIBE links and cross-cuts with the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance and the Galway Statement by reviewing the three European basins (Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Baltic) as well as the Caribbean Basin. 
The project begins with an assessment of the current Blue Growth economy. A socio-economic study of the various Blue Growth sectors will be undertaken. Existing business models will be mapped according to best practice methodology, cognisant of their value chains. The technical and non-technical challenges of the business will be identified and proposals made for their mitigation. Key FP7 projects that focus on multi-use of space and multi-use platforms will also be assessed. 
The consortium will draw on this study to identify key opportunities for synergistic collaboration. It will examine 24 sectoral combinations in total and 12 of those with high potential will be developed further. To do this, MARIBE will work with selected EU-funded consortia (particularly those involved in the Oceans of Tomorrow projects) to develop cross-sectoral projects. It will also work with a range of academic and industry partners to develop projects within 5 additional sectoral combinations that present potential for synergistic collaboration. The MARIBE partners will take a hands-on approach to developing collaboration, brokering partnerships where necessary and assisting with the creation of the business plans and implementation plans required to secure investment for these 12 projects.",2015-03-01,2016-08-31,1977951.25,,['renewable energy'],1,1
1682,645984,ERN,The European Remanufacturing Network - coordinating and supporting European remanufacturers,"Remanufacturing is an important component of a resource efficient manufacturing industry. By keeping components and their embodied material in use for longer, significant energy use and emissions to air and water can be avoided. In addition to environmental benefits, remanufacturing provides opportunities for the creation of highly skilled jobs and economic growth.  

Despite these accolades, remanufacturing is an undervalued part of the industrial landscape and an under-recognised sustainable industry. Activity to promote remanufacturing is currently undertaken at a sectoral level for some product sectors. In Europe, unlike in the recycling industry, cross-sectoral activities to facilitate knowledge transfer and promote the industry do not exist. Our major competitors, the US and China, already have a common vision and strategy for remanufacturing within their industrial landscape. An outcome may be that European remanufacturing could lose competitiveness against these more organised sectors. As a result, there is a real need for a European-level solution to encourage remanufacturing throughout Europe.

This proposal sets out the formation, coordination and support of a European Remanufacturing Network (ERN) over a project period of two years, which aims to:
â€¢ encourage new businesses to take up remanufacturing
â€¢ help existing remanufacturers improve their operations
â€¢ improve competitiveness of remanufacturers domestically and internationally
â€¢ create greater awareness of remanufacturing in the public and policy makers to increase demand and address barriers.

The aims of the ERN will be achieved through:
â€¢ mapping out the current remanufacturing landscape in Europe and estimating its future potential
â€¢ disseminating best practice in remanufacturing business models, processes and design
â€¢ providing industry with remanufacturing knowledge, tools and partnerships
â€¢ undertaking an information campaign to raise the profile of the European remanufacturing industry.",2015-02-01,2017-01-31,1489221.25,,['recycling'],1,1

The HEAT proposal brings together Europe's leading researchers on homomorphic cryptography (KU LEUVEN, UNIVBRIS and UL), with the leading expertise on lattice based cryptanalysis (UPMC), and three industrial partners with existing interests in the field (CRX, NXP and Thales UK). The goal of HEAT is to produce a step change in the efficiency and applicability of this technology. The proposal leverages existing ground breaking research in Europe, and links this with three industrially contributed case studies as a way of grounding the research in practical issues. 

The case studies proposed by the industrial partners consist of smart grid, statistical analysis to automate the detection of organized crime and shared satellite infrastructure applications.

The project will focus on Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE). Not only is this a stepping stone on the way to Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the partners also believe that SHE is a useful cryptographic tool in its own right. We aim to demonstrate this applicability via our three case studies.

Motivated by the three case studies the project will examine new design and implementation techniques for homomorphic cryptography, as well as a thorough security analysis. The security analysis is likely to have wider applicability due to the linkage with post-quantum cryptographic systems based on lattices. The proposed outputs of HEAT are an open source software library to support applications that wish to use homomorphic cryptography. The results of the HEAT project will be highly beneficial to European industry and academic research since they allow for using homomorphic cryptography to be used by a much wider variety of end developers.",2015-01-01,2018-03-31,4165726.25,,['smart grid'],1,1
1684,649717,RESFARM,Developing and implementing financial instruments for the mobilisation of investments in renewable energy in the agrarian sector,"On-farm Renewable Energy Systems (RES) can provide agrarian communities with an extra source of stable income, while guaranteeing long term clean energy supply for society. Despite their enormous potential for RES, in practice many farmers are not capable of accessing the financial, technical and administrative resources required for installing RES capacity on their farms. This is caused by RES investments generally being restricted to project finance for large installations while RES types that can be installed on farms require bank loans. This limitation greatly restricts capital supply while raising overall cost. Most farms in the targeted countries have a low credit profile that disqualifies them for loans. To overcome this limitation and fully take advantage of the last few yearsÂ´ cost reductions and performance advancements in RES, a tailored investment instrument is needed that can attract capital from capital markets and especially from institutional investors to on-farm RES. The recent appearance of innovative investment schemes, addressed to overcome similar challenges in other sectors, demonstrates that, by creating pools of RES, access to capital market resources can be realized. The proposed action is designed to initiate a structured dialogue among farmers, financiers and other relevant experts and stakeholders in order to develop and promote such an investment instrument, tailored for on-farm RES. The consortium that presents this proposal includes, among other key stakeholders, a leading European financial institution, a university as well as the largest farmersÂ´ associations of Spain, Italy and Greece.

1689,733487,INTERCOME,INTERnational COmmercialization of innovative products based on MicroalgaE,"Microalgae are an inexhaustible source of proteins, lipids, pigments, vitamins or carbohydrates, among others. Therefore, they find potential commercial applications in several sectors of economic activity. Some of them are already commercially viable, i.e. in aquaculture, agriculture, human nutrition or cosmetics, while some others still need R&D to be further developed, i.e. in bioenergy or pharma. In addition, bearing in mind that microalgae are the most efficient natural CO2 capturing system, are very productive and do not compete with fertile lands, they have potential to simultaneously contribute to palliate the big crisis humankind is facing: environmental sustainability, energetic efficiency, and food security. AlgaEnergy, a solid Spanish biotechnology based SME, did identify this potential. Since its establishment, it has served as a vehicle to consolidate the existing knowledge within the scientific field of microalgae in Spain -a recognized international hub in the matter-, which was dispersed across universities. Using it as a stepping stone, it has been investing in generating further R&D in order to scale-up the processes and develop ready to market products, so that the achievements in the lab phase reach also the society. Within this task, AlgaEnergy has recently been able to reach a semi-industrial scale (TRL 7) with the start of the first phase operations of its semi-industrial plant in South of Spain, which captures real flue gas emissions directly from the second biggest combined cycle plant in Europe, being a worldwide premiere.

The future sustainable harvesting of these resources requires the exploitation of difficult-to-access, unconventional reserves and is threatened by concerns on the environmental safety and high cost of drilling operations. To overcome these threats, there are strong needs for advanced tools for virtual drilling scenario testing and drilling automation and for multidisciplinary employees with adequate technical and transferable skills.

The HYDRA EID research and training program addresses both needs by founding an intersectoral doctoral school. The consortium represents top-level expertise in all scientific and engineering disciplines needed to take on the main challenges of HYDRA: multiphase flow dynamics, model reduction, control and mathematics. Moreover, the consortium houses expertise ranging from academic research & training (TU/e, MINES) and industrial R&D (Kelda) to industrial practice and training (MH Wirth, Well Academy), therewith offering a broad spectrum of training.

1692,691404,biowave,Upscale and demonstration of a integrated novel microwave pre-treatment system for efficient production of biogas from anaerobic digestion of pig manure to create a sustainable waste management system,"Ashleigh Farms Limited are successful pig rearers for the pork meat industry. Currently they own over 1,500 sows that produce a combined total of 37,000 pigs per year. The pig farming industry is significant across Europe and it is increasingly becoming more and more difficult for pig farmers to be profitable and competitive. There are numerous legislations that are inhibiting the ability for pig farmers to prosper. Regulations and targets in place to control pollution and contamination are leaving pig farmers with less and less economical use for pig slurry. Pig herds are constantly growing and the slurry amounts are quickly reaching a crisis point. In order to improve margins and remain in business pig farmers require an innovative solution. We have developed a novel and innovative microwave pre-treatment technology that increases the compatibility of pig slurry for anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of pig slurry is currently economically unviable as there is a requirement to add organic carbon sources in the ratio of 8:1. The microwave pre-treatment process converts hard carbon in the slurry, which cannot be digested by bacteria, into soluble carbon, thus increasing the total bio-available carbon in the slurry and improving the Carbon:Nitrogen ratio. Therefore the costs of using AD with pig slurry, are extremely high. Our innovative pre-treatment technology removes the need to add organic material and increases the biogas yield from slurry by 20%. This therefore provides farmers with a realistic solution to deal with the ever-growing amounts of slurry produced. With a payback of 4 years, our biowave system provides an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective method for pig slurry treatment that eases farmersâ€™ legislative burdens. It helps reduce energy costs and helps to achieve the EU goal of sourcing 20% of all energy consumed from renewable energy.",2016-04-01,2018-07-31,1364244.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

The project contributes to bridge the gap of skills needed to plan energy measures in the new 2030 framework for Climate and Energy Policy in terms of GHG emission reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency. EMPOWERING addresses energy saving challenges involving local municipalities and regional authorities in a sound transnational exchange and learning activities (WP3) including: a) transnational seminars; b) peer to peer exchange for regional authorities; c) study visit to one EU best practice and two partnersâ€™ best practice. Local target audience is then effectively reached thanks to ad hoc capacity local building measures (WP4) addressing different target groups to maximize the learning experience. The improved knowledge and competences of local authorities are put into practice during the development of  the mitigation part of SECAPs and in the upgrading of the existing SEAPs, while regional authorities are supported in shaping regional energy vision to 2050 highlighting the main energy challenges and identifying possible financial strategic actions to be implemented (WP5). The proposal is built on a solid and innovative strategic planning methodology which has a high replicability potential, strengthening the European added value of the project. This process is triggered by the cooperation of a comprehensive partnership, which involves technical-scientific partners and regional development agencies, creating the conditions to achieve projectâ€™s objectives.",2016-02-01,2019-07-31,1497003.75,,['renewable energy'],1,1

â€¢ Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels 
â€¢ Reduce emissions of small particles
â€¢ Develop soft mobility 

Your mobile phoneâ€™s range is (barely) one day. But a few times a year you travel, and need longer range. The solution is modularity. Would you carry a much heavier and more expensive phone everyday just for occasional peak usage? (although it would be technically easy to manufacture). We all take a charger, or an external battery when traveling. And whenever battery technology makes progress, itâ€™s for the benefit of size, weight and cost.

The range of an electric vehicle is enough for daily usage. But a few times a year you travel, and need longer range. Modularity is a solution as well. Few would choose to drive a much larger and more expensive car everyday just for occasional peak usage (regardless of technical feasibility). Letâ€™s also use on demand mobile energy modules when traveling, providing unlimited range. Battery technology progress will result in leaner and cheaper EVs, with more payload and less taxpayer support. Meanwhile the EV market can grow at an accelerated pace as EV usability becomes identical to ICE vehicles, with the same affordability.

EP Tender is an on demand range extending service for electric vehicles, using mobile energy modules attached occasionally to the EV. The project presented here is to make a field test in France, and tests in Germany and China. It is supported by future potential clients having committed to participate to the pilot, and operating well over 2 000 electric vehicles. User acceptance is already proving excellent among EV owners and prospects. The field test will further evidence user demand, create strong dissemination momentum, and widen OEM support.

How many people around you drive an EV? How many more might when EP Tender becomes available?  EP Tender is a key to wider EV adoption!",2015-07-01,2017-09-30,942096.75,,['electric vehicle'],1,1

EoCoE (pronounce â€œEchoâ€) will use the prodigious potential offered by the ever-growing computing infrastructure to foster and accelerate the European transition to a reliable and low carbon energy supply. To achieve this goal, we believe that the present revolution in hardware technology calls for a similar paradigm change in the way application codes are designed. EoCoE will assist the energy transition via targeted support to four renewable energy pillars: Meteo, Materials, Water and Fusion, each with a heavy reliance on numerical modelling. These four pillars will be anchored within a strong transversal multidisciplinary basis providing high-end expertise in applied mathematics and HPC.
EoCoE is structured around a central Franco-German hub coordinating a pan-European network, gathering a total of 8 countries and 23 teams. Its partners are strongly engaged in both the HPC and energy fields; a prerequisite for the long-term sustainability of EoCoE and also ensuring that it is deeply integrated in the overall European strategy for HPC. The primary goal of EoCoE is to create a new, long lasting and sustainable community around computational energy science. At the same time, EoCoE is committed to deliver high-impact results within the first three years. It will resolve current bottlenecks in application codes, leading to new modelling capabilities and scientific advances among the four user communities; it will develop cutting-edge mathematical and numerical methods, and tools to foster the usage of Exascale computing. Dedicated services for laboratories and industries will be established to leverage this expertise and to foster an ecosystem around HPC for energy.

The proposal address one of SPIRE Roadmap Key Actions  â€œNew ways of targeting energy input via electrochemicalâ€. 
The TER unit may be used in a large field of applications, but will be developed for a specific relevant case:  the synthesis of PEF (PolyEthylene Furanoate), a next generation plastic. TERRA project aims to make a step forward in this process by coupling the FDCA and MEG synthesis in a single novel TER reactor, with relevant process intensification. 
Between the elements of innovation of the approach are: i) operation at higher T,P than 'conventional' electrochemical devices for chemical manufacturing, ii) use of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, iii) use of novel 3D-type electrodes to increase productivity, iv) use of electrode with modulation of activity, v) possibility to utilize external bias (from unused electrical renewable energy) to enhance flexibility of operations. 
In addition to scale-up reactor and test under environmental relevant conditions (TRL 5), the approach in TERRA project is to address the critical elements to pass from lab-scale experimentation to industrial prototype with intensified productivity. These developments are critical for a wider use of electrochemical manufacturing in chemical and process industries.

It aims at bringing photonics to a new level by developing a concept that can be well industrialised. This sustains EU leadership in photonics, as is the ambition of the work program.   

A new wafer-scale technology will thus be developed for direct and intimate attachment of III-V Indium-Phosphide (InP) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and BiCMOS electronic chips (ICs). The ICs contain the driver, receiver andcontrol electronics for the PIC and enable direct connection to polymer optical waveguides. This technology of â€˜wafer scale heterogeneous integrationâ€™ enables high-performance and high-density photonic-electronic (photronic) modules are created having a lower energy consumption, lower packaging complexity and lower cost compared to modules using more traditional interconnection techniques like wire bonding and laser welding of fibre connections. 

Next to the new bonding technology, an integrated module design technology is developed for efficient co-design of hybrid photonic and electronic modules. A library consisting of photonic/electronic standard modules, is created leveraging the process design kits (PDKs) of the most important European foundries of photonic chips in combination with a powerful BiCMOS. These tools are of significantimportance to industry, since they offer photronic module designers a standardised approach that highly facilitates the module design for SMEs and affordable manufacturing by photonic and electronic foundries.

1. A simplified ED system that can be used for brackish water desalination (8 pilots in developing countries) or for tap-water softening (2 pilots in Germany and the Netherlands).
2. A multistage ED system for industrial-scale seawater desalination, which will be demonstrated to reach energy consumption as low as 1.5 kWh/m3 (1 pilot in the Netherlands)
3. Combinations of the multistage ED system with the latest salinity gradient power systems (Reverse ElectroDialysis - RED), which can further reduce energy consumption for seawater desalination to the region of 1 kWh/m3 (1 pilot in the Netherlands)
4. The versatile nature of the developed innovations will be demonstrated by testing their combinations with Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems (1 pilot in Spain). This will allow initial market introduction, without the need to replace the extensive RO infrastructure.

1699,674413,ImpAl,Improvements for a cost-effective volume production of advanced aluminum,"Improvements for a cost-effective volume production of advanced aluminum (ImpAl)

The ImpAl project focusses on a group of advanced aluminum materials, Al-PLM, which have been developed by sole applicant PLM since 2000.  Al-PLM exhibits significantly better property combinations in terms of strength, weight, thermal conductivity and expansion than alternative materials such as steel, titanium alloys or conventional aluminum. As a consequence, these materials could be replaced by Al-PLM in a wide range of applications, while generating performance gains at the same time.   These advantages of Al-PLM are generated through a special nano-crystalline material structure, which is the result of an elaborated material formula and a sophisticated production technology. At the moment, however, the advantages of Al-PLM can only be realized for a limited number of high performance applications because the production capacity is too low and (in consequence) the production costs are too high for a broader market. Therefore, the ImpAl project now aims at expanding the production capacity for Al-PLM while reducing costs by 30-40%. In order to achieve this goal, PLM plans to upscale the current production technology and to introduce a recycling step for process waste. Through the optimized production line and reduced prize resulting from this development, a higher market penetration of Al-PLM can be achieved. Al-PLM will become more attractive for industries with a high use of aluminum and high requirements regarding material performance and lot size, like automotive, aerospace, electronics and chemical industry. Possible applications are light and very stable turbochargers for engines or heat sinks with high thermal conductivity and very low thermal expansion. As a result, it is expected that PLM will be able to significantly ramp up the quantity of processed materials and to broaden the product offering.",2015-07-01,2017-11-30,945408.63,,['recycling'],1,1

The Mobility Back-end as a Service (MBaaS) replaces such all-in-one systems, in which a municipality purchases the full set of components from a single vendor. Instead, the city manager can purchase best-of-breed devices and apps developed by third parties, with the only constraint being that they interoperate with the back-end via a free, open, smart city mobility API. This domain-specific API lowers barriers to entry for app and device developers, making it easier for innovative SMEs to enter the market. Furthermore, the API is offered via a variety of generic interfaces, including oneM2M, ETSI M2M, OMA LWM2M, and FIWARE NGSI. EMBERS thus clears the way for developers and to municipalities that have adopted any one of these potential emerging machine-to-machine (M2M) communication standards. Beyond its primary goal of bringing the MBaaS to market, EMBERS will stimulate development of an entire ecosystem around the MBaaS smart city mobility API. Separating out the back-end from the other components will, however, require rigorous testing. EMBERS will experiment with the system on two testbeds that are part of the FIRE\ OneLab facility: the FUSECO Playground, for M2M communications, and FIT IoT-LAB, for wireless sensor devices.

Given its importance it is not surprising that soil, especially its interaction with plant roots, has been a focus of many researchers. However the complex and opaque nature of soil has always made it a difficult medium to study.
In this ERC research program I will develop a state of the art image based model of the physical and chemical properties of soil and soil-root interactions, i.e., a quantitative, model of the rhizosphere based on fundamental scientific laws. 
This will be realised by a combination of innovative, data rich fusion of structural and chemical imaging methods, integration of experimental efforts to both support and challenge modelling capabilities at the scale of underpinning bio-physical processes, and application of mathematically sound homogenisation/scale-up techniques to translate knowledge from rhizosphere to field scale. The specific science questions I will address with these techniques are: (1) how does the soil around the root, the rhizosphere, function and influence the soil ecosystems at multiple scales, (2) what is the role of root-soil interface micro morphology and mycorrhizae on plant nutrient uptake, (3) what is the effect of plant exuded mucilage on the soil morphology, mechanics and resulting field and ecosystem scale soil function and (4) how to translate this knowledge from the single root scale to root system, field and ecosystem scale in order to predict how the climate change, different soil management strategies and plant breeding will influence the soil fertility.",2015-09-01,2021-08-31,1996246.0,,['soil management'],1,1

Building on worldwide experiences with auctions in energy policy and other industries and on close cooperation with ongoing auction implementation cases in Europe, a strong knowledge base will be developed, enabling policy makers and market participants to make informed decisions. This knowledge base will be processed in a flexible policy support tool that provides policy makers with tailor-made information suited to their specific situation and policy preferences. By facilitating an intense and continuous stakeholder dialogue and by establishing a knowledge sharing network via workshops, webinars, bilateral meetings, and expert consultations, the project will serve as capacity building platform. The project consortium consists of eight renowned public institutions and private firms representing seven European countries and includes some of the leading energy policy experts in Europe, with an impressive track record of successful research and coordination projects.",2015-01-01,2017-12-31,1552600.75,,['renewable energy'],1,1

1712,645127,ACINO,Application Centric IP/Optical Network Orchestration,"The Internet has evolved into a three layer structure: at the top layer sit the applications generating traffic that is groomed at the IP and/or OTN layers and finally transported at the optical layer. Specific application needs, such as latency or protection requirements, are seldom guaranteed, because they are usually implicit and even when they are not, the need of the grooming layer to map large numbers of small flows into the small numbers of very large and static lightpaths is an obstacle to effective service fulfillment.

ACINO proposes a novel application-centric network concept, which differentiates the service offered to each application all the way down to the optical layer, thereby overcoming the disconnect that the grooming layer causes between service requirements and their fulfillment in the optical layer. This allows catering to the needs of emerging medium-large applications, such as database migration in data centers. To realize this vision, ACINO aims to develop an open source, vendor-agnostic modular orchestrator, which will expose to applications a set of high level primitives for specifying service requirements, and then perform multi-layer (IP and optical) planning and optimization processes to map these requirements into a set of lightpaths. The orchestrator will also be able to perform re-optimization, by means of a novel online in-operation planning module. The ACINO consortium has strong industrial foundations, and plans to demonstrate the advantages of its approach in a testbed with commercial equipment in a carrier environment.

ACINOâ€™s approach directly addresses the lack of dynamic control of optical networks, by automating planning and configuration tasks, and tackles the limitations in inter data center connectivity by allowing applications to request detailed and complex custom services to be provisioned in a timely manner. Overall, ACINOâ€™s open source and vendor-agnostic approach will foster the emergence of open industry standards.",2015-02-01,2018-01-31,2887055.0,,['data center'],1,1

ProSUM directly supports the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials and its Strategic Implementation Plan calling for the creation of a European raw materials knowledge base. 

Data on primary and secondary raw materials are available in Europe, but scattered amongst a variety of institutions including government agencies, universities, NGOs and industry. By establishing a EU Information Network (EUIN), the project will coordinate efforts to collect secondary CRM data and collate maps of stocks and flows for materials and products of the â€œurban mineâ€. The scope is the particularly relevant sources for secondary CRMs: Electrical and electronic equipment, vehicles, batteries and mining tailings. The project will construct a comprehensive inventory identifying, quantifying and mapping CRM stocks and flows at national and regional levels across Europe. Via a user-friendly, open-access Urban Mine Knowledge Data Platform (EU-UMKDP), it will communicate the results online and combine them with primary raw materials data from the on-going Minerals4EU project. To maintain and expand the EU-UMKDP in the future, it will provide update protocols, standards and recommendations for additional statistics and improved reporting on CRMâ€™s in waste flows required. 

ProSUM â€“ â€œprosumâ€ is Latin for â€œI am usefulâ€ â€“ provides a factual basis for policy makers to design appropriate legislation, academia to define research priorities and to identify innovation opportunities in recovering CRMs for the recycling industry.

The project partners ZSW and EMPA hold the current CIGS solar cell efficiency world records of 21.7% on glass and 20.4% on polymer film, achieved by using high (~650Â°C) and low (~450Â°C) temperature CIGS deposition, respectively. Both have developed new processing concepts which open new prospects for further breakthroughs leading to paradigm shift for increased performance of solar cells approaching to the practically achievable theoretical limits. In this way the costs for industrial solar module production < 0.35â‚¬/Wp and installed systems < 0.60â‚¬/Wp can be achieved, along with a reduced Capex < 0.75â‚¬/Wp for factories of >100 MW production capacity, with further scopes for cost reductions through production ramp-up.
In this project the performance of single junction CIGS solar cells will be pushed from ~21% towards 25% by a consortium with multidisciplinary expertise. The key limiting factors in state-of-the-art CIGS solar cells are the non-radiative recombination and light absorption losses. Novel concepts will overcome major recombination losses: combinations of increased carrier life time in CIGS with emitter point contacts, engineered grain boundaries for active carrier collection, shift of absorber energy bandgap, and bandgap grading for increased tolerance of potential fluctuations. Innovative approaches will be applied for light management to increase the optical path length in the CIGS absorber and combine novel emitter, front contact, and anti-reflection concepts for higher photon injection into the absorber. Concepts of enhanced cell efficiency will be applied for achieving sub-module efficiencies of >20% and industrial implementation strategies will be proposed for the benefit of European industries.",2015-05-01,2018-10-31,4563122.75,,['solar cell'],1,1

We have developed a biomass condensing boiler that has been internationally awarded (i.e. Expobiomasa, Spain; BoisEnergie d'Argent, France), surpassing from far the current state of art, in terms of performance (10% higher than high-end average boilers), ripping design (extremely compact with the best materials) and price (at least 20% less than comparable solutions). By taking advantage of the identified market opportunity, C-Heat will contribute to the growth of BioCurve and QuintÃ­n with a turnover of 11.4Mio. â‚¬ and 37 new jobs by 2023 introducing an innovative technology powered by renewable organic sources (pellets) and available in a broad range of power outputs (25kW to 200kW).
Former technologies for domestic heating are either unsuitable for moving forward towards a sustainable energy model across EU, or insufficient in terms of energy efficiency. In order to overcome these issues, BioCurve and Quintin have developed a cutting edge biomass boiler capable of working under condensing conditions. Thanks to a novel spiral heat exchanger that enhances 50% the exchange surface, C-Heat compact solution shows > 100% energy efficiency by capturing almost all latent heat of condensation of water vapor in the exhaust stream. In addition, an accurate control of the system enables low temperature applications (i.e. radiant floors). Until now, C-Heat has passed rigorous technical assessments, procuring international quality standards certifications (under EN14785 and EN303-5 norms). Also, several units are well operating in real condition, installed in private apartments since 2013. Therefore, we aim to become an international reference in the bio heating domestic and tertiary segments (i.e. detached and semidetached houses, neighbor communities, schools, district heating, playgrounds) as well as the small scale industry (such as farms or small food producers).",2016-09-01,2018-11-30,1408855.0,,['district heating'],1,1

By optimising usage of bio-based fertilisers (BBF) from side-streams, ensuring their safety, building evidence-based trust in their usage and developing legislative framework for their use, it will be possible to reduce dependence upon mineral/fossil fertilisers, benefiting the environment and the EUâ€™s economy.

LEX4BIO aims to achieve this by collecting and processing regional nutrient stock, flow, surplus and deficiency data, and reviewing and assessing the required technological solutions. Furthermore, socioeconomic benefits and limitations to increase substitution of mineral fertiliser for BBFs will be analysed. A key result of LEX4BIO will be a universal, science-based toolkit for optimising the use of BBFs in agriculture and to assess their environmental impact in terms of non-renewable energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and other LCA impact categories. LEX4BIO provides for the first time connection between production technologies of BBFs and regional requirements for the safe use of BBFs.

The large variation between EU regions in nutrient flows and regional requirements for fertilisers will be estimated by harmonised methods to produce the knowledge basis needed to set up feasible ways to redirect the nutrient flows where needed. This will be followed by classifying the best available technologies for producing regionally tailored BBFs to secure high agricultural productivity, as well as environmental protection, food safety and human health.

In LEX4BIO, the knowledge basis and recommendations will be gathered and processed together with stakeholders across Europe, providing best solutions for decreasing the dependency on imported fertilisers, closing the nutrient cycles and improving sustainability of European farming systems.",2019-06-01,2023-05-31,5999968.75,,['renewable energy'],1,1

The objective is to fulfil SDG6 by unlocking the environmental and economic potential of municipal wastewater treatment and reuse solutions for urban and peri-urban areas in India. By focussing on three pillars we ensure maximum impact:
-	People: we create social awareness through a participatory monitoring approach. We target social vulnerable groups by providing treatment solutions for open drains. We create a community of practitioners by the establishment of open innovation test sites and a training & learning network.
-	Planet: we focus on rejuvenation of the river by removing organic pollution, heavy metals and emerging compounds that have the biggest impact on Indian streams. We provide technology innovations to upgrade existing wastewater infrastructure and to add treatment systems to open drains, resulting in improved quality of receiving rivers.
-	Profit: we apply the principles of the Circular Economy and exploit the economic opportunities of waste-to-energy, water reuse and resource recovery. Solutions are cost efficient and require limited investments making them particularly suited for the Indian market.
In collaboration with local stakeholders and supported by industrial partners we will set-up two pilot sites at the Barapullah Drain (New Delhi) and the Jajmau plant (Kanpur).

To fully estimate the security of an enterpriseâ€™s system architecture, a large number of issues must be considered. Enterprise systems security managers must be able to assess how vulnerabilities in one system influence vulnerabilities in other systems. In addition, security managers must be able to assess how individual vulnerabilities influence the security of the entire system of systems, given the protection solutions that are used in different locations in the architecture. The project will deliver and validate a tool that helps to 1) better understand current cyber security levels across complex enterprise-wide architectures, including relationships and interdependencies between systems, 2) prioritize areas to address and cyber security investments to pursue and 3) proactively manage cyber security e.g. when building or modifying architectures. The solution is based on a cybersecurity metamodel that 1) describes the qualitative structure (which assets, attacks and defences that should be included, and how these should be associated and 2) populates this qualitative structure with quantitative data (how likely different attacks are to succeed given the system parameter values and the presence or absence of different defences, using Bayesian networks). The tool generates a vulnerability â€œheat mapâ€ for each system configuration, allowing a user-friendly and visual comparison of the different alternatives.

The harmonization includes linking scientists and stakeholders and connecting still isolated volcanological infrastructures located at in situ volcano observatories (VO) and volcanological research institutions (VRIs).  EUROVOLC will overcome fragmentation at various levels, including community, project and discipline fragmentation by addressing four main themes:  Community building, volcano-atmosphere interaction, sub-surface processes and volcanic crisis preparedness and risk  management. Examples of networking activities under these themes include collaboration and networking between VOs, VRIs and civil protection agencies, networking of atmospheric gas and aerosol observations as well as observations of subsurface processes, and initiation of access to multidisciplinary observations from Krafla Volcano Laboratory as a test bed. Joint research activities include production of services to initialize volcanic ash transport and dispersal models during eruptions, integrated modelling of pre-eruption data, and a complete catalogue of European Volcanoes. Trans-national access to European Volcano observatories will be facilitated and virtual access to various modelling and assessment tools for responding to volcanic unrest and eruptions will be offered. Through these activities EUROVOLC will integrate the European volcanological community and open up and provide a wider, simplified, and more efficient access to key, multidisciplinary European research infrastructures located at leading VOs and VRIs to conduct improved volcanological research, drive best practice at volcanological observatories and open pathways for enterprise to better exploit georesources in volcanic areas such as geothermal energy.",2018-02-01,2021-01-31,4997292.5,,['geothermal energy'],1,1

and expensive recycling steps.
Hybrid coating formulations will combine cost-efficiently produced polyglycolic acid (PGA) and modified silica oxide. Fully biodegradable packages for fresh food products will be obtained with middle chain modified PHAs. PGA and PHA based hybrid coatings with high gas barrier properties will be further improved with active substances for improved shelf-life. Furthermore, new packages based on bio-PET and bio-PE combined with hybrid and active
coatings will be developed. The generated products will be validated and compared to current metallised, non bio-based alternatives in industrial products, in performance, shelf-life and biodegradability. Safety and regulatory compliance, environmental and economic sustainability will be specifically addressed.

1731,639070,SUSTAINABLEOCEAN,Accommodating New Interests at Sea: Legal Tools for Sustainable Ocean Governance,"This research project will develop a theoretical framework and legal tools to aid scholars and stakeholders (law and policy-makers, private investors, environmental NGOs) in managing competing interests in the offshore economic sector. The offshore sector is expanding and activities at sea are increasing (e.g., deep seabed mining, oil and gas extraction, renewable energy technologies, etc.). This situation threatens the health of the marine environment and its biodiversity. It also impacts traditional uses of the sea, such as navigation and fishing. New activities pose major challenges for the sustainable management of the oceans, and they highlight competing interests that the law needs to accommodate, such as: 
-  protecting the marine environment and conserving its biodiversity; 
-  mitigating climate change effects; 
- guaranteeing the continuity of the relevant economic activities; 
- guaranteeing energy efficiency and security; and
- protecting the rights of local communities and populations.

This project will answer the following research question: how can the law contribute to the sustainable use of the oceans and strike a balance between competing interests at sea? The law pertaining to ocean governance is fragmented into regimes that are imbued by different interests. The project will begin by analysing three legal frameworks, which are the most relevant for the offshore industry: the law of the sea, climate change law and energy law. It will focus on the operation of the offshore industry and on the competing interests, which have influenced the respective fields of law. This will allow identifying patterns of regime interaction and assessing their impact on the different uses of the sea. The research will ultimately offer a theory of interest- and regime-interaction in ocean governance and thus create a comprehensive framework for the development of legal tools(briefs, recommendation, which will contribute to sustainable ocean governance.",2015-10-01,2020-09-30,1051500.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

Main objectives are: 
â€¢ Formulate, consult on and revise an end-user oriented strategic research agenda (SRA), 
â€¢ Scope out models of implementing the SRA, 
â€¢ Prepare a network of public and private funding institutions willing to commonly fund the execution of the SRA. 
INSPIRATIONâ€™s mission is to improve the supply and effectiveness of science/knowledge take-up by those who really need it. The proposed methodology is based on a multi-stakeholder, multi-national and interdisciplinary approach that covers the variety of stakeholders (public bodies, business, science, citizens and society) and the variety of relevant. The vehicle to engage with all relevant stakeholders across the Member States is a National Focal Point (NFP) in 16 countries. The NFPâ€™s will organize workshops with national stakeholders of funders, end users and researchers across the various soil and land management disciplines. The results will be taken up, structured along four integrative themes and merging into thematic knowledge needs to satisfy the as yet unmet societal challenges and to ensure that knowledge contributes primarily to enable meeting these challenges. Based on these results a cross country and cross discipline dialogue will subsequently be organized among the relevant user communities, funding bodies and scientific communities in Europe in order to reach a trans-national, prioritized SRA as well as a model for execution of this SRA.

1733,639526,NANOGEN,Polymer-based piezoelectric nanogenerators for energy harvesting,"Energy harvesting (EH) from ambient vibrations originating from sources such as moving parts of machines, fluid flow and even body movement, has enormous potential for small-power applications such as wireless sensors, flexible, portable and wearable electronics, and bio-medical implants, to name a few. Nanoscale piezoelectric energy harvesters, also known as nanogenerators (NGs), can directly convert small scale ambient vibrations into electrical energy. Scavenging power from ubiquitous vibrations in this way offers an attractive route to supersede fixed power sources such as batteries that need replacing/recharging, and that do not scale with the diminishing size of modern electronics. This proposal aims to develop NGs for future self-powered smart devices. Ceramics such as lead zirconium titanate and semiconductors such as zinc oxide are the most widely used piezoelectric EH materials. This proposal however focuses on a different class of piezoelectric materials, namely ferroelectric polymers, such as polyvinlyidene fluoride (PVDF), its copolymers, and nylon. These are potentially superior EH materials as they are flexible, robust, lightweight, easy and cheap to fabricate, as well as being lead-free and bio-compatible. The key strategy of this proposal is in combining i) materials engineering to create novel piezoelectric polymer-ceramic nanocomposite materials with enhanced EH functionalities, ii) state-of-the art nanoscale characterization to explore and exploit these novel materials, and iii) fabrication of high performance NGs for implementation into commercial devices, using insight gained from modelling of materials and device parameters. The proposed research will culminate in a well-defined process for the large-scale production of highly efficient and low cost piezoelectric NGs with reliable EH performance to power the next generation of autonomous devices, thus steering the field into the renewable energy market as a clean and competitive technology.",2015-04-01,2020-03-31,1635710.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

These biocatalytic cascades and biosynthetic pathways will be developed for the synthesis of chiral and achiral amines that are of particular interest for the chemical industry. The amine functionality will be introduced using amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) as biocatalysts in the pivotal core enzymatic step. AmDHs are a new class of enzymes that have recently been obtained by protein engineering of wild-type amino acid dehydrogenases. However, only two AmDHs have been generated so far and, moreover, they show a limited substrate scope. Therefore protein engineering will be undertaken in order to expand the substrate scope of the already existing AmDHs. In addition, novel AmDHs will be generated starting from different wild-type amino acid dehydrogenases as scaffolds, whose amino acid and DNA sequences are available in databases, literature, libraries, etc. In particular, protein engineering will be focused on the specific chemical targets that are the objectives of the designed biocatalytic cascades and in addition, screening for more diverse substrates will also be carried out. Finally, the AmDHs will be used in combination with other enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases, oxidases, alkane monooxygenases, etc., to deliver variously functionalised amines and derivatives as final products with elevated yields, perfect chemo- regio- and stereoselectivity, enhanced atom efficiency and minimum environmental impact. Such an approach will be realised through the design of new pathways that will convert inexpensive starting materials from renewable resources, encompassing the internal recycling of redox equivalents, the use of inorganic ammonia as nitrogen source and, if necessary, only molecular oxygen as the innocuous additional oxidant.

The second objective it to develop high-efficiency flexible and compact piezo-generators based on ordered arrays of nanowire heterostructures. The crucial ingredient - and also the common basis - of the two proposed research axes are the advanced nanowire heterostructures: we will develop nanowires with new control-by-design functionalities by engineering their structure at the nanoscale. The main focus of NanoHarvest will be on the III-nitride semiconductors, which are characterized by a strong piezoelectric response and have also demonstrated their ability for efficient photon harvesting in the blue and green parts of the solar spectrum. Our strategy is to address the physical mechanisms governing the energy conversion from the single nanowire level up to the macroscopic device level. The deep understanding gained at the nanoscale will guide the optimization of the device architecture, of the material growth and of the fabrication process. We will make use of Molecular Beam Epitaxy to achieve ultimate control over the nanowire morphology and composition and to produce control-by-design model systems for fundamental studies and for exploration of device physics.

1736,844230,Mel.Photo.Protect,Unraveling the Photoprotecting Mechanism of Melanin - From a Library of Fragments to Simulation of Spectra and Function,"Melanin is the deeply coloured, insoluble and heterogenous biopolymer of animal skin, hair and eyes responsible for protection against harmful light action. It also has a pathogenic role as a generator of reactive oxygen species and possibly through chemiexcitation, and its polydopamine synthetic analogue has raised great interest in the materials community. In spite of these multiple points of interest, the details of melanin structure and its main photoprotecting function are still largely unknown, mostly due to the heterogeneous polymer structure. Closing this gap is an urgent challenge, and our proposal aims at doing that with the methods of computational chemistry. Based on the widely accepted hierarchical structure model for melanin, in WP1 we will generate a library of aggregates made of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) oligomers with different connectivity and redox state (diol, semiquinone and quinone forms). In WP2 we will simulate the absorption spectra of the aggregates and compare them with the experimental melanin spectrum, which starts at the near IR and increases monotonically into the UV. In WP3 we will simulate the excited-state decay mechanisms for the different aggregates in order to explain melanin's lack of fluorescence, which is indicative of fast decay responsible for its photoprotecting function. The results of our project will provide a new view on the photoprotecting function of melanin based on a systematic consideration of its heterogeneous structure, and they will allow us to assess what specific aggregates are responsible for the different functional characteristics. They will help us to assess the possible pathogenic role of melanin chemiexcitation, and provide new principles for design of PDA-based functional materials.",2019-09-01,2021-08-31,172932.48,,['biopolymer'],1,1
1737,818437,QSHvar,Quantitative stochastic homogenization of variational problems,"The proposal addresses various multiscale problems which lie at the intersection of probability theory and the analysis of partial differential equations and calculus of variations. Most of the proposed problems fit under the framework of stochastic homogenization, that is, the study of large-scale statistical properties of solutions to equations with random coefficients. In the last ten years, there has been significant progress made in developing a quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization, meaning that one can now go beyond limit theorems and prove rates of convergence and error estimates, and in some cases even characterize the fluctuations of the error. These new quantitative methods give us new tools to attack more difficult multi-scale problems that have until now resisted previous approaches, and consequently to solve open problems in the field.

Many of the actual goals of the proposal come from problems in calculus of variations. Apart from qualitative results, many fundamental questions in quantitative theory are completely open, and our recent results suggest a way to tackle these problems. The first one is to prove regularity properties of homogenized Lagrangian under rather general assumptions on functionals, and to solve a counterpart for Hilbert's 19th problem in the context of homogenization. The second project is to attack so-called Faber-Krahn inequality in the heterogeneous case. This is a very involved problem, but again recent development in the theory of homogenization makes the attempt plausible. The final part of the proposal involves new mathematical approaches and subsequent computational research supporting the geothermal power plant project being built by St1 Deep Heat Ltd in Espoo, Finland.",2019-08-01,2024-07-31,1312500.0,,['geothermal power'],1,1

The defect engineering of MOFs has been used as a tool to modify their porosity, chemical reactivity and electronic conductivity among other properties, but research is still limited in the vast majority towards Zr-MOFs. Notably, defect chemistry of Ti-MOFs remains unexplored despite that the pristine materials photoactivity, chemical and structural stability and Titanium being an abundant biocompatible metal.

This project, entitled `Defective Titanium Metal-Organic-Frameworks(DefTiMOFs)â€™ aims to develop novel high-throughput (HT)synthetic methodologies for the control of not only defect chemistry of Ti-MOFs,but also of their particle size and inner surface (porefunctionalisation) towards the controllable modification of their properties. HT synthesis will be convened with a set of novel characterisation techniques (mainly synchrotron-based) for atomic and molecular level of characterisation of defects, aiming to correlate synthetic conditions with defect formation (defect type, densityand spatial distribution within the framework)in order to provide thebase of knowledge to anticipate their properties based on the synthetic conditions. This will then allow for defect engineering of MOFs using a wide range of materials.

In view of the above and inspired by the high demand for clean and renewable energy sources including efficient and affordablewater delivery systems in places with limited access to drinkablewater, the DefTiMOFs project aims to correlate defect chemistry of Ti-MOFs with their performance towards environmentally friendly applications.

1740,845687,EVERPHOT,Molecular mechanisms of photoprotection in plants.,"Photosynthesis is a biological process of primary importance, as it provides the energy that drives food, feedstock and biofuel production and mitigates climate change. Light in excess of photosynthetic capacity can be damaging, thus ways to protect against damage have evolved, including ways to minimize light absorption, detoxify reactive oxygen species generated by excess light, and dissipate excess absorbed light. Together, these processes are known as photoprotection. Despite the physiological importance of photoprotection, the molecular mechanisms that protect against light stress remain largely unknown, especially those that protect from prolonged light stress. The objective of the proposed research project is to solve molecular mechanisms of photoprotection in plants. My specific aims are to 1) investigate the function of known involved factors in sustained energy dissipation in the model plant Arabidopsis, 2) identify novel molecular players and 3) use an organism that is genetically adapted to cope with high light stress, the evergreen Norway spruce. The research will be carried out in my laboratory where genetics, biochemistry, biophysics and physiological approaches will be combined to address this problem.

A big part (53%) of the cost is in drilling and it is time-dependent. Geo-Drill aims to reduce drilling cost with increased ROP and reduced tripping with improved tools lives. Geo-Drill is proposing drilling technology incorporating bi-stable fluidic amplifier driven mud hammer, low cost 3D printed sensors & cables, drill monitoring system, Graphene based materials and coatings. Geo-Drill fluidic amplifier driven hammer is less sensitive to issues with mud and tolerances, less impact of erosion on hammer efficiency and it continues to operate with varying mud quality in efficient manner. It is also less affected by the environmental influences such as shocks, vibrations, accelerations, temperature and high pressures. Low cost and robust 3D-printed sensors & cables along the surface of the whole length of the drill string provides real-time high bandwidth data during drilling; e.g. estimation of rock formation hardness, mud flow speed, density, temp, etc. Flow assurance simulations combined with sensor readings and knowledge-based system will assist in optimizing drilling parameters and cuttings transport performance and safety conditions. Graphene's ability to tune the particular form lends itself uniquely as a component in a wide variety of matrices for coating developments with enhanced adhesion and dispersion properties and improved resistance to abrasion, erosion, corrosion and impact. Placing few mm hard-strength materials on drill bit, drill stabilizer through diffusion bonding improves their wear resistance and improve the lifetime. Geo-Drill's hammers improved efficiency and lifetime, drill parameter optimisation and CTP via sensors, reduced time in replacing tools with improved lifetime work together to improve ROP & lifetime resulting in reduced drilling time.

Here, we focus on nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes called nanozymes, which have been shown to be highly stable and low-cost alternatives to natural enzymes in a wide range of applications. For example, the self-organization of Zn complexes on the surface of gold nanozymes has been shown to generate multiple bimetallic catalytic sites capable of promoting the cleavage of an RNA model substrate. This two-metal-aided mechanism found in nanozymes closely resembles that used by many metalloenzymes that process nucleic acids in cells. However, the complex, hybrid, and flexible nature of the outer coating monolayer of nanozymes has so far made it difficult to investigate the structure and dynamics of these multifunctional chemical systems, which have reached a level of complexity resembling that of proteins. 
Within this context, this projectâ€™s ambition is to use classical and hybrid QM/MM simulations coupled to free-energy computation, integrated with experiments, to study the metallo-dependent functionality and mechanisms of nanozymes that cleave nucleic acid model substrates. Through CompNanozymes, the fellow will thus acquire additional expertise in computational simulations, completing his research skill set and allowing him to grow into an independent group leader.

Moreover, a significant side benefit of this research is a further development and validation of a fatigue test method for CFRPs towards standardization. The project involves: (1) formulate and characterize a series of epoxies modified by different nano-additives, i.e. rubber, silica, carbon nanotubes and graphene; (2) produce a series of d-CFPRs based on selected nano-modified epoxies and recycled carbon fibres; (3) characterize the mechanical properties, fracture toughness and fatigue resistance of the d-CFRPs; (4) investigate the fracture mechanisms and quantify the fracture features of d-CFRPs for both quasi-static and fatigue failure to build the correlation between fracture features and energy dissipation; (5) further develop and validate a fatigue test approach for CFRPs towards standardisation, together with other world-leading researchers from ESIS-TC4 (European Structural Integrity Society Technical Committee 4).

It is estimated that more than one-quarter of the world's population is infected with this airborne infectious disease. Moreover, the increase of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant TB is alarming. TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an intracellular pathogen that can survive in host cells, mainly in macrophages. The uptake of the antitubercular drugs by infected host cells is limited. The orally or intravenously administered drugs are distributed throughout the body causing side effects and the majority of the drug molecules do not reach their targets. The elimination of the intracellular bacteria could be more efficient with host cell directed delivery. The TBNANO project aims to develop and in vitro evaluate antitubercular agent-loaded nanocapsules decorated with host cell targeting molecules. For this purpose, naturally occurring, biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide nanocapsules loaded with a recently approved anti-TB drug (bedaquiline) and antimicrobial peptides will be used. The surface of the nanocapsules will be functionalized with macrophage targeting ligands, such as peptides and mannose derivatives. With such nanotechnology-based drug delivery system, enhanced cellular uptake can be achieved by the host cell macrophages, therefore, the anti-TB agent can reach the intracellular bacteria as site of action. This approach leads to increased bioavailability and selectivity of the drugs while reducing their undesirable side effects. The proposed project could provide a breakthrough step in nanotechnology-based TB treatment to get closer to a world free of TB. Furthermore, this multidisciplinary project provide valuable transfer of knowledge to the host institution, as well as advanced training of the young researcher in the field of nanomaterial science to broaden her expertise in drug delivery systems.",2019-07-01,2021-06-30,172932.48,,['nanomaterial'],1,1

The emerging digitalized and connected era calls for a paradigm shift in the way we discover, design and create batteries. High-performance materials and structures must be designed from the atomic level up, using advanced approaches like density functional theory calculations in combination with machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to analyse big data collected from characterization, synthesis and testing. Sustainable chemistries must be integrated into battery cells, and critical degradation processes must be monitored by novel sensors embedded in smart batteries to take adequate corrective measures in real time. All this will lead to batteries combining high energy and power densities and thus enabling rapid charging, while at the same time being highly safe and durable, and with a low environmental footprint. 
The BATTERY 2030\ initiative will be based on a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial approach to bring in all the necessary skills for developing future European battery roadmap while addressing a wide range of strategic applications. To achieve this goal, a team of 17 partners, leaders in their fields, from 9 EU member states will join efforts. Three specific objectives have been defined: 1) BATTERY 2030\ roadmap establishment 2) Propose R&D actions and 3) Secure official stakeholder commitments. Related WPs, tasks, milestones and risks are considered to achieve these objectives.

1747,845939,Cryo-H-Rec,Cryo-EM Imaging of Histone Recycling at the Replication Fork,"DNA replication is essential for cell proliferation. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is densely packaged in nucleosome arrays that form chromatin. Such organisation protects the genetic material and controls access to DNA, thus providing an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. The eukaryotic replication machinery has evolved to unravel nucleosomes in order to access and duplicate DNA, while also maintaining chromatin density on newly duplicated DNA. To achieve this, the replisome dismantles nucleosomes ahead of the replication fork and reassembles them on nascent DNA strands, by coordinating redeposition of parental and newly synthesized histones. Histone proteins are subject to an array of post-translational modifications (PTMs), providing an epigenetic code that modulates activation and silencing of specific chromosomal regions. Redeposition of parental histones with their PTMs on both nascent DNA strands is, thus, pivotal in transmission of the epigenetic marks to daughter cells. I intend to perform in vitro reconstitution of the replisome on a chromatinised template and use cryo-electron microscopy to image DNA duplication and parental histone recycling at the replication fork. I seek to describe different structural intermediates in the process of nucleosome disassembly, DNA duplication and histone incorporation into new nucleosomes. To capture and characterise intermediate states of the replication machinery during this concerted process, I will employ a multidisciplinary approach and resort to structural techniques complementary to cryo-EM like solution NMR spectroscopy and crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS). My results will help dissect the role of different replisome components in nucleosome reshuffling at the replication fork, and elucidate the molecular mechanism that underpins chromosome replication and epigenetic inheritance.",2019-04-01,2021-03-31,212933.76,,['recycling'],1,1

Access to such a Test Bed will help establish the industrial eco-systems, R&D investments and new supply chains to support market entry as well as providing a global competitive advantage, leading to growth and job creation.  
For Europe to be more competitive compared to the US and Asia, digitalisation of both the development and manufacturing of functional nanomaterials and printed components needs to be established, as well as addressing cost, productivity and capacity. The digitalisation of the European production industry (industry 4.0) through digital based production technologies, such as ink-jet printing, additive manufacturing, robotically assisted in-mould labelling, laser processing, stereo lithography, etc., requires functional nanomaterials and formulations and is a major bottleneck due to high prices and limited volume production. 
LEE-BED will address these challenges by building European infrastructure for rapid development and pilot production of nanomaterial, inks, adhesives and composites as well as digital based pilot production lines. LEE-BED will unify the entire value chain from raw materials to embedded electrical components, providing tailored solutions for European entrepreneurs, start-ups, SMEs and large enterprises, with the main objective of going from concept to prototype within six months. Unique to LEE-BED will be the development of tailored services, including technical, business, patent mapping, safety and life-cycle analysis modelling. LEE-BED will also provide funding services for LEE-BED access to SMEs and post-project capital.

The revolution is driven by sustainable forest management and anticipated by EU forest strategy, the Bioeconomy Action Pan, and the demands of environmentally aware end-users of wood industry products. Until recently, detailed information on forest carbon cycle has not been available due to a lack of scientific understanding, spatial data availability, limited processing capacity, and the complexity of implementing this information in business processes. Forest Flux will use the explosive increase in high-resolution EO data by Copernicus program and developments of cloud computing technology. It will implement world-first service platform for high-resolution maps of traditional forestry variables together with forest carbon fluxes using a holistic approach in a single processing chain. By the end of the project, forestry and carbon data will be completely integrated into the decision-making processes of selected core users and establish the leadership of European industry in sustainable utilization of forest resources. The relevant algorithms have been recently demonstrated by consortium partners. The computing infrastructure is specifically targeted for EO data and forestry users, and will be fully functional by the end of the project. The web-based human and machine interfaces will allow market access unrestricted by country boundaries and facilitate easy commercial interactions of players of different sizes and backgrounds.

1753,815943,RADDICS,Reliable Data-Driven Decision Making in Cyber-Physical Systems,"This ERC project pushes the boundary of reliable data-driven decision making in cyber-physical systems (CPS), by bridging reinforcement learning (RL), nonparametric estimation and robust optimization. RL is a powerful abstraction of decision making under uncertainty and has witnessed dramatic recent breakthroughs. Most of these successes have been in games such as Go - well specified, closed environments that - given enough computing power - can be extensively simulated and explored. In real-world CPS, however, accurate simulations are rarely available, and exploration in these applications is a highly dangerous proposition. 

We strive to rethink Reinforcement Learning from the perspective of reliability and robustness required by real-world applications. We build on our recent breakthrough result on safe Bayesian optimization (SAFE-OPT): The approach allows - for the first time - to identify provably near-optimal policies in episodic RL tasks, while guaranteeing under some regularity assumptions that with high probability no unsafe states are visited - even if the set of safe parameter values is a priori unknown. 

While extremely promising, this result has several fundamental limitations, which we seek to overcome in this ERC project. To this end we will (1) go beyond low-dimensional Gaussian process models and towards much richer deep Bayesian models; (2) go beyond episodic tasks, by explicitly reasoning about the dynamics and employing ideas from robust control theory and (3) tackle bootstrapping of safe initial policies by bridging simulations and real-world experiments via multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, and by pursuing safe active imitation learning. 

Our research is motivated by three real-world CPS applications, which we pursue in interdisciplinary collaboration: Safe exploration of and with robotic platforms; tuning the energy efficiency of photovoltaic powerplants and safely optimizing the performance of a Free Electron Laser.",2019-01-01,2023-12-31,1996500.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

However, enzymes are intrinsically vulnerable to elevated temperatures and unnatural microenvironments hampering their wide-spread use in production processes and consumer products. The stabilization of enzymes via small-molecular crosslinkers (INCYPRO), developed in the Grossmann lab, increases the robustness of enzymes towards conditions required for biotechnological applications. INCYPRO has the potential to improve current biotechnological processes and to allow completely new applications. As the method allows straight-forward and broad application, it is suitable for further valorization.

1757,825453,Caladan,Micro assembled Terabit/s capable optical transceivers  for Datacom applications,"Data centers which underpin the Cloud are under pressure. As the capacity of data center servers is growing, so must the capacity of the links between those servers. Industry foresees a need for high volumes of 800Gb/s and 1.6Tb/s transceivers by 2025. 
Today, despite the use of complex Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), manufacturing an optical transceiver still requires a large number of sequential steps. This is because lasers and electronic chips need to be assembled on a piece-by-piece basis onto the PIC. The resulting optical engine then needs to be coupled to a fiber array and packaged. These steps are done sequentially, creating a bottleneck in the manufacturing line which makes it hard to scale up production and reduce cost. 
CALADAN will demonstrate how integration of lasers and electronics onto a PIC can be done fully at the wafer-level using the established micro transfer printing technique, thus eliminating this bottleneck. GaAs quantum dot lasers and 130nm SiGe BiCMOS 56Gbaud capable driver and receiver electronics will be transfer printed onto Silicon Photonic 300mm wafers. Starting from proven concepts in PIXAPP, a novel fast fiber attachment process will be demonstrated that reduces the time required for fiber attachment by an order of magnitude. Using these techniques, transceiver cost will be 0.1Euro/Gb/s for volumes of at least 1,000,000 units.

PUReSmart will bridge the gap between the current PU linear economy to a circular model by designing smart polyurethane materials that can be reshaped into new products with undiminished quality. PUReSmart will provide solutions for the identified three scientific-technological urgent needs that require conceptual breakthroughs:

However, in the area of very strong oxidizers even the familiar oxido(-II) ligand becomes redox-innocent and assigning oxidation states becomes ambiguous. Very strong (super-) oxidizers are compounds whose oxidizing strength exceeds that of elemental F2. Anyhow, not only molecular oxidizer but also their interaction with the environment in different media needs to be considered, as these dramatically affect their intrinsic oxidizing strength. Here we propose novel conjugate oxidizer/Lewis or BrÃ¸nsted acid systems with extremely high ox. power. These new ox. media make use of the alliance of high ox. strength and Lewis /BrÃ¸nsted super acidity. The investigation and development of oxidizers is of essential interest in all areas of chemistry and beyond. Unfortunately a detailed understanding of this fundamental chemistry is still lacking. Here we describe based on three work strands PV, MI, and BP, how we aim at a more fundamental understanding of such systems. The undertaken research, which includes qc investigations, molecular characterizations in matrices and synthetic fluorine chemistry as well as oxido complexes is summarized in five work packages describing different prototype areas (organigram). Based on the gained knowledge, the project will rank and specify such oxidizers and the mechanism leading to ox. media. By using the threefold work strand approach, our project will guide us in a systematic discovery of the systems with high application potential in terms of selectivity and disposability, and oxidizing systems with high to ultrahigh oxidation potentials, and into the chemical terra incognita of fragile molecules at the edge of stability.

The goal of POLKA is to solve serious technical problems, which are unique to hydrogen combustion: thermoacoustic instabilities and flashback. Thermoacoustic instabilities are large-amplitude pressure oscillations caused by an escalating interaction between the flame and acoustic waves; they tend to occur unexpectedly and cause major hardware damage. Flashback is the dangerous phenomenon of the flame propagating backwards into components not designed for high temperatures. The ultimate vision of POLKA is to create new physical insight and advanced simulation tools, so as to underpin the development of hydrogen-fuelled combustion systems (gas turbines, aero-engines, boilers furnaces, etc). The methods to be used are a combination of experiments, numerical simulations and analytical techniques. Experimental validation of numerical and analytical results is a high priority.

1761,802182,Neurovulnerability,Molecular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal death in motor neuron diseases,"The mechanisms behind neuronal death in different motor neuron diseases (MND) remain unknown. These MNDs include the devastating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A fascinating question in neurodegeneration research is why mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes result in the selective death of a specific neuronal subtype. The ubiquitously expressed and conserved survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein receives its name because its deficit results in MN degeneration. However, SMN known functions -spliceosome assembly and axonal mRNA transport- do not explain the selective MN vulnerability. 
Accumulation of intracellular aggregates in neurons is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. The lysosome-autophagy system is the main catabolic pathway for recycling of protein aggregates and damaged organelles, and its role as a quality control system is especially critical in neurons, due to their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. The hypothesis for this proposal is that SMN deficiency leads to a lysosome-autophagy dysfunction which results in a proteostatic failure, underlying MN degeneration. Furthermore, the existing heterogeneity in SMN protein levels across MN populations may determine their probability of survival. 
To test these hypotheses we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to genetically engineer human control, SMA and ALS patient-derived iPSCs to generate isogenic and reporter lines that will allow us to study selective neuronal subtypes at a single-cell level. We will also follow an interdisciplinary approach using a SMA Drosophila model to identify new molecular pathways essential for SMN neuropathology. Altogether, my research proposal aims at untangling the molecular mechanisms underlying selective MN death. Our results will open up new directions of research into the molecular basis of neurodegeneration and will provide clues for the design of therapeutics targeting specific neuronal types or phases of MNDs.",2019-07-01,2024-06-30,1472667.34,,['recycling'],1,1

1766,817999,BIOFIT,Bioenergy retrofits for Europeâ€™s industry,"One way in which bioenergy production can be increased is through retrofitting, the addition of new technology or features to existing industrial installations. Retrofitting means often lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), shorter lead times, faster implementation, less production time losses, lower risks and therefore faster project development and increased market benefits. BIOFIT aims to facilitate bioenergy retrofitting in five industries: first-generation biofuels, pulp and paper, fossil refineries, fossil firing power and combined heat and power plants. 

First an overview will be made of existing options for retrofitting, and best practices analysed, to establish (both technical and non-technical) success factors. This will constitute the basis for two core project actions i.e. the development of 10 concrete bioenergy retrofitting proposals (2 each per industry) and the establishment of dedicated working groups for each industry (industry platform) to facilitate two-way dialogue. Both actions will be industry-driven, and focus on identifying and helping to solve actual â€“ general and industry-specific â€“ barriers towards wider market uptake. BIOFIT will give specific attention to generating information for policy development. Acceptance of bioenergy, both by the industries and by the general public, is key to the industriesâ€™ transformation towards sustainable bioenergy generation and market uptake. Research into acceptance factors is an integral part of project set-up. Key issues will be highlighted, and guidelines for industries will be issued. 

The BIOFIT consortium is a multidisciplinary partnership, with strong industrial involvement, broad coverage across Europe, and existing practical experience developing bioenergy retrofits. The expertise of the consortium covers all five target industries. BIOFIT consortium partners have wide networks in industry and industry platforms, ensuring relevance and transferability of all results.",2018-10-01,2021-09-30,2626237.5,,['combined heat and power'],1,1
1767,827030,PulseTester,Next-Generation Thyristor pulse technology for testing of high power magnetic components in DC Smart Grids,"Driven by the soaring demand for hybrid and electric vehicles and the large investments in renewable energies, the soft magnetic materials market is expected to reach the â‚¬100 billion mark by 2026. Together with increasing number of stringent regulations (particularly in the EU), this growth is expected to drive the emergence of advanced material testing equipment for the automotive and semiconductor industries. 

Accurate soft magnetic component testing is therefore becoming essential to select and develop efficient materials for key grid components and thus limit power loss and maximize system efficiency. However, there is still a clear lack of accurate measuring systems to test nonlinear high power magnetic components in DC voltage grids. This leads to a pressing market demand for innovative advanced quality testing solutions for these materials.

Bs&Tâ€™s innovative prototype, PulseTester, has been designed specifically to fill this technical gap. Using the latest thyristor semiconductor technology and implementing an innovative circuit measuring system, we have been able to establish a revolutionary and effective pulsed technique capable of characterizing inductive component for middle voltage soft magnetic components. We can measure energy loss of magnetic components with unparalleled accuracy, offering a unique advantage in comparison with current alternatives, for a much lower price.

With the final validation and full commercial release of PulseTester, we will help improve energy efficiency by facilitating adoption of highly optimized soft magnetic components in DC Smart Grids and renewable energy systems. We will gain a strategic advantage in the market, selling a cumulated 3,000 units by 2024 and raise our turnover by over â‚¬23 million. PulseTester will provide us increased visibility and allow us to consolidate our brand as a reference in the magnetic material testing market, leading to the creation of over 50 jobs in the EU across the value chain.",2018-09-01,2019-01-31,50000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

A new circular economy value chain will be generated from agro-food wastes that will be exploited for the production of PHB, while designing and validating the process up to pilot scale. Blending of PLA and PHB will be validated at pilot scale to achieve specific final product requirements based on targeted products. New bioplastic properties and functionalities will be achieved through incorporation of nanocellulose or nanochitin additives (to improve typical problems of processability and mechanical properties of PLA-PHB), antioxidant and antimicrobial additives. The ability to extend the functionalities will be validated in real industrial environments. NEWPACK activities are underpinned by the prior experience and results (already validated at TRL 3-4) of the partners in order to achieve advanced TRLs (5-6) for the developed technologies, including PHB production from potato peels/sweet corn residues; co-blending of PHB with PLA; nanocellulose extraction from wheat straw and incorporation into PHB-PLA blends and encapsulation of natural antioxidants/antimicrobials for addition to PHB-PLA.

1770,826722,SIGNIA,SIGNIA: An innovative drug discovery platform for rapid identification and validation of antimicrobial applications in available pharmaceutical resources and drugs open for repurposing.,"The economic and social burden of infections is being enhanced by the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. This phenomenon is outpacing the industryâ€™s capacity for drug discovery and development. Antimicrobial resistance is costing the EU today â‚¬1.5 billion and 25,000 deaths annually. Developing de novo classical drugs is very costly and time consuming, and for every new drug released a resistant strain has rapidly emerged. This paradigm is hindering our ability to respond to outbreaks. Among causative organisms, viruses pose a major threat, being responsible for the outbreaks impacting the world in the past decade (SARS, Influenza A, MERS, etc). Although some antivirals have been developed for them, they lose their efficacy rapidly due to the high mutation rate of viruses, which alters the antigenic features originally used to develop the drug. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel discovery methods that allow to accelerate the development of broad-spectrum and mutability-independent antimicrobials. In response, Signia Therapeutics has developed and validated a drug discovery platform for fast identification of compounds with antimicrobial activity. Instead of selecting drugs that target pathogen determinants, it selects drugs that target determinants of the infected cell. This method offers key advantages: i) avoids the impact of microbe intrinsic mutability; ii) broad spectrum drugs can be identified. Since the platform seeks for antimicrobial applications among drugs already commercialized (repurposing) and among pharma libraries (recycling), drug discovery becomes faster, safer and cost-efficient. Having reached the functional stage (TRL6), this project encloses the roadmap to finalise the platformâ€™s development and its preparation for market. Once completed, this project will have huge impacts for society (better management of infections and preparedness against outbreaks), and for our company (expected ROI of â‚¬2.1 from this project after 5 years).",2018-08-01,2018-11-30,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,1

1772,805046,EvoConBiO,Uncovering and engineering the principles governing evolution and cellular control of bioenergetic organelles,"'Complex life on Earth is powered by bioenergetic organelles -- mitochondria and chloroplasts. Originally independent organisms, these organelles have retained their own genomes (mtDNA and cpDNA), which have been dramatically reduced through evolutionary history. Organelle genomes form dynamic populations within present-day eukaryotic cells, akin to individuals co-evolving in a 'cellular ecosystem'. The structure of these populations is central to eukaryotic life. However, the processes shaping the content of these genomes through history, and maintaining their integrity in modern organisms, are poorly understood. This challenges our understanding of eukaryotic evolution and our ability to design rational strategies to engineer bioenergetic performance.

EvoConBiO will address these questions using a unique and unprecedented interdisciplinary approach, combining experimental characterisation and manipulation of organelle genomes with mathematical modelling and cutting-edge statistics. This highly novel combination of experiment and theory will drive the field in a new direction, for the first time uncovering the universal principles underlying the evolution and cellular control of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Our groundbreaking recent work on mtDNA suggests a common tension underlying organelle evolution, between genetic robustness (transferring genes to the nucleus) and the control and maintenance of organelles (retaining genes in organelles). EvoConBiO will reveal the pathways underlying organelle evolution, why organisms adapt to different points on these pathways, and how they resolve this underlying tension. In addition to these 'blue sky' scientific insights into a process of central evolutionary importance, we will harness our findings to 'learn from evolution' in high-risk high-reward development of new experimental strategies to engineer chloroplast performance in plants and algae of importance in EU agriculture, biofuel production, and bioengineering.'",2019-07-01,2024-06-30,1417862.0,,['biofuel'],1,1

Freeform and microstructured optical surfaces are generated directly on the components through thermoplastic microreplication, using microstructured inserts.   The technology aims to simplify the assembly routes for heterogeneously integrated optoelectronics, with drastic cost reduction, high productivity and improved device performance. Such advantages are demonstrated by three case studies (Datacom transceiver, Optical encoder and OLCD display), showing the flexibility of the processing route and the superior quality of the produced parts.   Two control strategies will be tested for improving the yield: process monitoring/actuation, and functional quality assessment of the produced optoelectronic assembly. The mould cavity will be instrumented to verify the quality of the injected material and monitor the components alignment with respect to the optical features of the mould. On the other hand, the manufacturing path will incorporate an in-line optical and functional quality inspection system, with complete traceability of each produced part. The project will incorporate data-based quality awareness computing, supported by process abstraction, for predictive quality assurance and process adjustment based on cognitive control.   A pilot optical assembly line will incorporate all the advances in the project.

These beams quickly destroy fragile materials, making imaging them a major challenge. I have recently developed a new approach that provides the greatest possible resolving power per electron. The method provides both double resolution and excellent noise rejection, via multidimensional data acquisition and analysis. Here I propose to couple the new method with breakthroughs in high speed cameras to achieve unprecedented clarity at low doses, almost guaranteeing major advances for imaging beam sensitive materials. Proof of principle will be achieved for biochemical imaging using the easy to handle, commercially available GroEL chaperone molecule. We will combine our enhanced imaging capabilities with the averaging methods recently recognized by the Nobel prize in chemistry for imaging biomolecules at ultra low doses. After proving our low dose capabilities we will apply them to imaging proteins of current interest at greater resolution. Similar techniques will be used for fragile materials science samples, for instance metal organic framework, Li ion battery, 2D, catalyst and perovskite solar cell materials. Furthermore the same reconstruction algorithms can be applied to simultaneously acquired spectroscopic images, allowing us to not only locate all the atoms, but identify them.

Accomplishing this will enable more efficient treatment with less side effects. 
WHAT: RE-IMMUNE is an interdisciplinary programme in which the field of nanomaterial and nucleic acid nanotechnology merge to develop intelligent nano- encapsulated siRNA for safe and efficient delivery of siRNA in cancer-associated immune cells, to re-program and shift the tumor microenvironment from pro to anti-tumoral. To achieve this goal, I will undertake a high risk/high gain programme at the forefront of nanomedicine. The leading idea is to overcome the drawbacks of naked siRNA by combining two synergic strategies that will protect siRNA until recognition of its target site. I will evaluate intracellular trafficking of siRNA nanodevices and the silencing effect. I will also investigate possible synergic effect of a siRNA cocktail able to target different genes at the same time. Finally, I will evaluate the re-immunoediting action in vivo. 
HOW: The challenge met by the proposed program is to provide a groundbreaking contribution to cancer treatment. To achieve these objectives, I will combine the different scientific backgrounds and expertise of two leading scientists. Prof. Frank Caruso (University of Melbourne) is a world-wide recognized expert on nanomaterials and biomedicine, and Prof. Francesco Ricci (University of Rome Tor Vergata) leads a young and dynamic group at the forefront of DNA nanotechnology for sensing and drug-delivery applications.

The project seeks to apply the pillars of integrated water management (IWM) as a model for â€œwater planningâ€ (akin to spatial planning) and to demonstrate low cost, modular technologies that can be easily retrofitted into any water management infrastructure at district/plant level, hence enabling even small communities and SMEs to implement virtuous practices. Technologies and planning instruments complement each other as the first make possible the second and the latter can provide as example or even prescribe the former (and similar technologies allowing virtuous water use practices). Indeed the technologies support the regulators in implementing policy instruments, as foreseen by IWM, for convincing stakeholders (like developers and industry) to implement water efficiency strategies and could include instruments for e.g. rewarding virtuous behaviours (for example: advantageous water tariffs), planning regulations that award planning consent more swiftly or even prescribe the use of water from alternative sources (including recycling). Project Ã” has in summary the overall objective of providing stakeholders (everybody using or regulating the use of water in an area) with a toolkit that enables them to plan the use of and utilise the resource water whatever its history and provenance, obtaining significant energy savings in terms of avoided treatment of water and waste water and release of pressure (quantity abstracted and pollution released) over green water sources.

Global livestock production, specifically ruminant farming, has been associated with land use change, methane emissions, climate change, deforestation and biodiversity loss. At the same time, consumption of livestock proteins exceeds total human protein requirements for a healthy diet in most European Member States. 

However, ruminants can convert biomass unsuitable for direct human consumption (e.g. grass resources) into valuable food, including essential macro and micro-nutrients for humans. While grazing, ruminants contribute to: maintaining the landscape and, in specific local conditions, to; enhancing biodiversity and increasing carbon sequestration.

The contemporary industry challenge is therefore to develop livestock production systems that simultaneously enhance environmental sustainability and support a healthy diet. This is a knowledge-intensive process. Therefore, this European Industrial Doctorate (EID) programme â€“ HEARTLAND\ will connect one of the most notable industry to the cutting-edge scientific knowledge while maximising the impact of the programme by working closely with experts in communication (to multiple audiences) and dissemination (to potential end-users).

Recent advances in mathematical programming have shown that the polynomial optimization problems can be approximated by sequences of Semi-Definite Programming problems. This approach provides a powerful way to compute global solutions of non-linear optimization problems and to guarantee the quality of computational results. On the other hand, advanced algebraic algorithms to compute all the solutions of polynomial systems, with efficient implementations for exact and approximate solutions, were developed in the past twenty years.

The network combines the expertise of active European teams working in these two domains to address important challenges in polynomial optimization and to show the impact of this research on practical applications. The network will train a new squad of 15 young researchers to master high-level mathematics, algorithm design, scientific computation and software development, and to solve optimization problems for real-world applications. It will advance the research on algebraic methods for moment approaches, tackle mixed integer non-linear optimization problems and enhance the efficiency and robustness of moment relaxation methods.

Since the very beginning, the main market demands for 3rd generation PV were more flexibility and more colour choices. Both of these ideal properties lead to new business opportunities in BIPV, electronic consumer goods, textiles, etc. These technologies also have low cost using fully printing process, low temperature processes and out of clean rooms which reduce the production cost. The most important problem in PSC technology is the short lifetime which is currently the main barrier for the marketability of PSC. Up to now all the developed PSC used cheap materials and/or solution which did not exhibit high efficiencies. In contrast high efficiency PSCs usually require relatively expensive materials and vacuum deposition process. PSC toxicity is considered to be negligible since the amount of lead in perovskite layer is not so relevant if it is compared against Si technology, nevertheless, the solvent toxicity should be taken in account in order to benefit industrialization of PSC products.

However, the viability of perovskite solar cells is still far behind commercialization due to difficulties arising from little air-stability and inconsistent power output. The FASTEST project aims to synthesize air-stable inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) for their application in high-performance photovoltaics. Inorganic perovskite NCs exhibited outstanding optical properties, with photoluminescence quantum yield above 80%, i.e. low charge recombination losses. However, current nanoparticle synthesis methods use bulky, high-boiling point ligands which hamper the formation of high quality optoelectronic thin films, i.e. films with high charge transport and limited recombination, which severely limits possibilities of applications. This project will overcome these hurdles by engineering perovskite NCs by introducing short ligands for room temperature (RT) synthesis and compositional substitution with second metallic ions to stabilize perovskite NCs with an optimal bandgap. Furthermore, to attain air-durability as well as a good dispersion in solution states, novel polymeric passivating materials which protect perovskite NCs from degradation will be incorporated. These will develop effective strategies for enhancing the durability of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles from synthesis scheme to device operations. The technological advancement will be supported by fundamental studies on the photophysical properties of perovskite NCs related with physics of defect and perovskite degradation under controlled conditions of humidity, light, and temperature. This will lead to an understanding of the degradation mechanisms in the perovskite NCs, finally a demonstration of the solution-processable perovskite NCs for flexible large-area PV applications.",2018-09-01,2020-08-31,180277.2,,['PV'],1,1

The corresponding emission is 1.5 Mt CO2. A reduction in fossil consumption by 70% can be achieved by integrating a HTHP in the deep-frying process.
The global market value of frozen French Fries is about 19 billion $ with Europe as the largest market, then North-America and Asia-Pacific. They represent the growth path for our potato frying solution.
Commercial objectives: Tocircle will reach annual HTHP sales of 63 Mâ‚¬ in Y3 after project completion, a profit of 16 Mâ‚¬ and creating 100\ new jobs in Europe from the European potato frying segment alone.
Technical objectives: to mature Tocircleâ€™s patented rotary vane compressor using Evaporative Compression Technology (ECT), to integrate an ECT compressor package into a full-scale pilot HTHP system and to demonstrate the solution at one of 11 frying lines of company Aviko, a major international French fries producer.
ECT is a disruptive technology allowing the HPHT to deliver temperatures up to 200 oC",2018-05-01,2020-03-31,2500000.0,,['heat pump'],1,1

Attacks on content and quality of service of the IoT platforms can have economic, energetic and physical security consequences that go way beyond the traditional Internetâ€™s claimed lack of security, and beyond the threats posed by attacks to mobile telephony. The secure SerIoT platform is a key step that can be used to implement secure IoT platforms and networks anywhere and everywhere. The SerIoT project will develop, implement and test a generic IoT framework based on an adaptive smart Software Defined Network with verified software, secure routers, advanced analytics, and user friendly visual analytics. SerIoT will optimize the information security in IoT platforms and networks in a holistic, cross-layered manner (i.e. IoT platforms & devices, honeypots, SDN routers and operatorâ€™s controller) that will be based both on dynamic and distributed processing of variable complexity by single network components (i.e. IoT platforms, devices and honeypots will perform lightweighted processes while SDN routers will be shouldered with more heavy processes), as well as on a centrally located server/controller that will have the main control of the network and will collect, aggregate and fuse the relevant information. Large-scale pilots will test SerIoT technology in various use cases including intelligent transport and surveillance, flexible manufacturing within Industrie 4.0 and other emerging domains such as food chain & logistics, m-Health (both at Home & in Hospitals business scenarios) and energy (smart grid).Through these technology developments and test-beds, the project will deliver a unique portable software-based SerIoT network that can spearhead Europeâ€™s success in the IoT.",2018-01-01,2020-12-31,4999083.75,,['smart grid'],1,1
1787,776868,SECLI-FIRM,The Added Value of Seasonal Climate Forecasts for Integrated Risk Management Decisions,"The central objective of SECLI-FIRM is to demonstrate how the use of improved climate forecasts, out to several months ahead, can add practical and economic value to decision-making processes and outcomes, primarily in the energy sector, but also in the water sector. Specifically for the energy sector, SECLI-CLIM will assess the impact on operational planning and portfolio management, such as hedging and asset optimization, thus enabling quantification of the value-add provided by seasonal forecasts which have been calibrated, evaluated and tailored for each specific application. Improvements in management decisions will ultimately lead to an improved supply-demand balance and therefore to a more efficient energy system, particularly with respect to renewable energy, with corresponding benefits for climate change mitigation. 

A simple, but effective, methodology will be used to assess value added. A control case will only utilise climatological conditions based on historical averaged values â€“ currently the most common approach â€“ while a test case will also consider individually optimised and tailored state-of-the-art probabilistic seasonal forecasts. This will be done for nine case studies for Europe and South America: recent seasons with anomalous/extreme climate conditions leading to problematic and quantifiable impacts for the energy and/or water industry. Crucially for success, the case studies will be co-designed by industrial and research partners.

These case studies will provide the basis for developing pilot climate services for a number of specific applications, allowing evaluation of the added value of near real-time information for decision making. Thus SECLI-FIRM will promote research advances in the optimization of seasonal forecasts for specific applications (e.g. by evaluating both local processes and large-scale teleconnections), as well as promoting the uptake of seasonal forecasts by industry and hence expansion of the climate services market.",2018-02-01,2021-07-31,4638500.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1
1788,761214,STARSTEM,NanoSTARS imaging for STEM cell therapy for arthritic joints,"STARSTEM proposes imaging of stem cell engraftment in arthritic joints of large animals at clinically relevant depths, using nanoparticles with novel optical properties which enable unprecedented penetration depth and sensitivity. Arthritis is the most prevalent disease worldwide, with osteoarthritis (OA) affecting around 10% of the global population and around 70 million patients in Europe. There is no effective cure for OA at present and the majority of the treatments are symptomatic and not restorative. Stem cell therapy provides a unique opportunity for the self-regeneration of injured cartilage. One of the major hurdles in stem cell mediated-therapy is the inability to diagnose successful engraftment in real time using conventional imaging techniques. STARSTEM will address the major technology gaps to enable imaging of human stem cells at clinically relevant depths. STARSTEM is proposing the use of novel dual plasmonic gold nanostars (nanostars)-enhanced multi-modal imaging to detect stem cell engraftment and tissue repair, and thus their activity and efficacy as a therapy. STARSTEM will harness the best properties of light and sound with a photoacoustic (PA) imaging system for large animal and human finger imaging as proof-of-concept which exploits the unique advantages of our nanomaterial for differential and deep-tissue imaging. Functional imaging using PA enables the real time monitoring of engraftment and the therapeutic process at the site of interest, while highly sensitive anatomical imaging using MRI (using nanostar conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles as contrast agent) enables tracking of the movement and retention in individual organs of the transplanted cells that did not engraft. Algorithms for co-registered PA-MRI imaging approach will enable monitoring of the therapeutic process with high sensitivity.

1789,779942,CROWDBOT,Safe Robot Navigation in Dense Crowds,"CROWDBOT will enable mobile robots to navigate autonomously and assist humans in crowded areas. Todayâ€™s robots are programmed to stop when a human, or any obstacle is too close, to avoid coming into contact while moving. This prevents robots from entering densely frequented areas and performing effectively in these high dynamic environments. CROWDBOT aims to fill in the gap in knowledge on close interactions between robots and humans during navigation tasks. The project considers three realistic scenarios: 1) a semi-autonomous wheelchair that must adapt its trajectory to unexpected movements of people in its vicinity to ensure neither its user nor the pedestrians around it are injured; 2) the commercially available Pepper robot that must navigate in a dense crowd while actively approaching people to assist them; 3) the under development robot cuyBot will adapt to compact crowd, being touched and pushed by people. These scenarios generate numerous ethical and safety concerns which this project addresses through a dedicated Ethical and Safety Advisory Board that will design guidelines for robots engaging in interaction in crowded environments. 
CROWDBOT gathers the required expertise to develop new robot capabilities to allow robots to move in a safe and socially acceptable manner. This requires achieving step changes in a) sensing abilities to estimate the crowd motion around the robot, b) cognitive abilities for the robot to predict the short term evolution of the crowd state and c) navigation abilities to perform safe motion at close range from people. 
Through demonstrators and open software components, CROWDBOT will show that safe navigation tasks can be achieved within crowds and will facilitate incorporating its results into mobile robots, with significant scientific and industrial impact. By extending the robot operation field toward crowded environments, we enable possibilities for new applications, such as robot-assisted crowd traffic management.",2018-01-01,2021-06-30,3997660.0,,['traffic management'],1,1

Preventive maintenance strategies designed for traditional highly repetitive and stable mass production processes based on predefined components and machine behaviour models are no longer valid and more predictive-prescriptive maintenance strategies are needed.
The Z-Break solution comprises the introduction of eight (8) scalable strategies at component, machine and system level targeting (1) the prediction occurrence of failure (Z-PREDICT), (2) the early detection of current or emerging failure (Z-DIAGNOSE), (3) the prevention of failure occurrence, building up, or even propagation in the production system (Z-PREVENT), (4) the estimation of the remaining useful life of assets (Z-ESTIMATE), (5) the management of the aforementioned strategies through event modelling, KPI monitoring and real-time decision support (Z-MANAGE), (6) the replacement, reconfiguration, re-use, retirement, and recycling of components/assets (Z-REMEDIATE), (7) synchronizing remedy actions, production planning and logistics (Z-SYNCHRONISE), (8) preserving the safety, health, and comfort of the workers (Z-SAFETY).
Z-Bre4k impact to the European manufacturing industry and the society can be summarised in the following: (i) increase of the in-service efficiency by 24%, (ii) reduced accidents, (iii) increased Verification according to objectives, (iv) 400 new jobs created and (v) over â‚¬42M ROI for the consortium.

Moreover, an efficient availability, access and use of geospatial data are often missing. This hinders the growth of new applications and societal welfares. Progress in provision of efficiently and effectively derived 3D geospatial information is thus the key to more comprehensive, faster and better exploitation of geodata, for the benefit of individuals and societies. Last but not least, new occupations are emerging in the geospatial industry which requires capacity building for developing new applications of geospatial technologies. The VOLTA project, through secondments, training activities and networking, will facilitate knowledge exchange and career progresses in the geospatial field. The project will develop innovative solutions to (i) automatically provide metric information from images, (ii) fuse heterogeneous data coming from various sensors, (iii) segment 2D and 3D geospatial data and (iv) process large geospatial datasets in the Cloud.

1792,747167,NanoZfish,Restoration of motor dysfunction in vivo through nanomaterials based devices,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are nervous system maladies that impair the function of spinal central pattern generators for locomotion. These disorders carry a significant social and economic burden, owing to a lack of effective therapeutic treatments. In the field of nanotechnology, carbon nanotubes (CNT) have shown outstanding promise for the improvement of neuronal function in vitro and are thus ideal candidates for repairing or ameliorating spinal defects associated with these disorders. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop CNT as a tool for restoring motor dysfunctions associated with SCI and ALS. Specifically, I will use zebrafish larvae as an in vivo model for testing the therapeutic efficacy of this innovative class of implantable devices. I will implant CNT and graphene based devices in healthy, spinal cord lesioned and ALS zebrafish models and test their effects on spinal cord function with a range of powerful in vivo techniques. My project will address three specific aims. First, biocompatibility of implanted devices will be assessed using in vivo patch clamping of spinal motoneurons in healthy fish implanted with nanodevices.  Second, I will implant CNT into fish that have been subjected to SCI. Nanomaterial-facilitated functional recovery will then be tested with in vivo patch clamping of spinal motor neurons, analysis of locomotor behaviour and confocal microscopy. Finally, I will use similar approaches to determine if implanted CNT can slow or reverse spinal cord defects in a SOD1 mutant zebrafish model of ALS. The project will advance our knowledge in an innovative field of bioscience research and help to inform the development of alternative  approaches to the treatment of SCI and ALS.

These so-called Ultra-High Intensity (UHI) lasers have led to the development of a very active research field, which studies the interaction of light with matter at these extreme intensities. This field is largely motivated by the prospects of generating compact sources of high-energy particles and short-wavelength light, which are being foreseen for applications in particle physics, material science, nuclear fusion technology, medicine. 
The actual feasibility of the promising applications of UHI lasers will largely depend on the availability of more reliable and controlled laser systems. In this context, the recent results obtained in the framework of the ERC project PLASMOPT have shown that both major obstacles and great prospects towards this goal are related to space-time couplings (STC) â€“ i.e. a spatial dependence of the laser pulse temporal structure. Yet, there is still no device capable of measuring these STC. The goal of the present project is thus to bring up on the market the first STC measurement device, called TERMITES. This will allow identifying the source of the residual STC, and then eliminating them to reach optimal performances, thus reducing the cost needed to reach a given laser peak intensity by hundreds of kâ‚¬ or more. It will also have indirect societal benefits, by contributing to the maturation of the technology of UHI lasers, and thus favouring their foreseen societal and industrial applications.  
Two key tasks of this project are 1- building two to three industrial demonstrators of TERMITES and 2- using these demonstrators to perform a test and validation campaign on a representative set of fs lasers. Depending on the findings of this campaign, this device will be commercialized either through a technology transfer through licensing to an existing company, or through a start-up creation.",2017-05-01,2018-10-31,150000.0,,['nuclear fusion'],1,1

1795,720726,LIBBIO,Lupinus mutabilis for Increased Biomass from marginal lands and value for BIOrefineries,"The Andes Lupin (Lupinus mutabilis, tarwi) grows excellently in marginal lands due to itÂ´s excellent foraging characteristics having the ability to fix nitrogen, mobilise soil phosphate and have low nutritional requirements for cultivation. For the increased biomass needed in Europe in coming years and decades we cannot rely on the most fertile lands, which is currently allocated to food production, we need to increase the yield from marginal lands. There the lupin varieties are preponderant, the one providing highest yield (up to 80 ton/ha) is Lupinus mutabilis. Varieties can be chosen for giving this high yield of green silage or high yield of seeds contain more than 20% oil, more than 40% protein and the remainder carbohydrates are mainly oligosaccharides characterized as â€œprebioticsâ€. Andes lupin can be grown as a summer crop in N-central Europe conditions and as winter crop in Mediterranean conditions.  

Breeding and cropping research is performed in the LIBBIO project for maximizing the yield and value of lupin agriculture in different European marginal lands conditions, with respect to both the farmers and biorefineries. Pre-industrial processing is developed and optimized for the lupin, properties of the different fractions analysed, their advantage for different industrial use evaluated, and a few products developed as an example. 

With respect to environmental impact the lupin is expected to be superior. It does not need much fertilizer, it enriches the soil with nitrogen and phosphate and is therefore expected to be excellent for crop rotation and soil regeneration. These properties will be evaluated further in the project along with techno-economic and agricultural viability and effect on farm and biorefinery income.",2016-10-01,2020-09-30,4923750.0,,['biorefinery'],1,1
1796,677232,ECOWORM,ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO EXOTIC EARTHWORM INVASION IN NORTHERN NORTH AMERICAN FORESTS,"Earth is experiencing substantial biodiversity losses at the global scale, while both species gains and losses are occurring locally and regionally. Nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly influence ecosystem functions and services. However, few experimental tests have examined the influences of invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionally strong impacts on native ecosystems. Invasive earthworms are a prime example of ecosystem engineers that influence many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworms invading northern North American forests may cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services like carbon sequestration. Using a synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on relationships between plant communities, soil food webs, and ecosystem processes. Further, effects of a changing climate on the spread and consequences of earthworm invasion will be investigated. Meta-analyses will be used to test if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differ from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversityâ€“ecosystem functioning relationships from an abovegroundâ€“belowground perspective. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversityâ€“ecosystem function research.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,1498620.0,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

Current data analytics systems are usually designed following two conflicting  priorities to provide (i) a quick and reactive response (referred to as data-in-motion analysis), possibly in real-time based on continuous data flows; or (ii) a thorough and more computationally intensive feedback (referred to as data-at-rest analysis), which typically implies aggregating more information into larger models. Given the apparently incompatible requirements, these approaches have been tackled separately although they provide complementary capabilities.
CLASS aims to develop a novel software architecture to help big data developers to combine data-in-motion and data-at-rest analysis by efficiently distributing data and process mining along the compute continuum (from edge to cloud) in a complete and transparent way, while providing sound real-time guarantees. CLASS aims at adopting (1) innovative distributed architectures from the high-performance domain; (2) timing analysis methods and energy-efficient parallel architectures from the embedded domain; and (3) data analytics platforms and programming models from the big-data domain.
The capabilities of the CLASS framework will be demonstrated on a real smart-city use case, featuring a heavy sensor infrastructure to collect real-time data across a wide urban area, and prototype cars equipped with heterogeneous sensors/actuators, V2I connectivity, and cluster support to present the innovative capabilities to drivers.

1798,637776,ALKENoNE,Algal Lipids: the Key to Earth Now and aNcient Earth,"Alkenones are algal lipids that have been used for decades to reconstruct quantitative past sea surface temperature. Although alkenones are being discovered in an increasing number of lake sites worldwide, only two terrestrial temperature records have been reconstructed so far. The development of this research field is limited by the lack of interdisciplinary research that combines modern biological and ecological algal research with the organic geochemical techniques needed to develop a quantitative biomarker (or molecular fossil) for past lake temperatures. More research is needed for alkenones to become a widely used tool for reconstructing past terrestrial temperature change. The early career Principal Investigator has discovered a new lake alkenone-producing species of haptophyte algae that produces alkenones in high abundances both in the environment and in laboratory cultures. This makes the new species an ideal organism for developing a culture-based temperature calibration and exploring other potential environmental controls. In this project, alkenone production will be manipulated, and monitored using state-of-the-art photobioreactors with real-time detectors for cell density, light, and temperature. The latest algal culture and isolation techniques that are used in microalgal biofuel development will be applied to developing the lake temperature proxy. The objectives will be achieved through the analysis of 90 new Canadian lakes to develop a core-top temperature calibration across a large latitudinal and temperature gradient (Î” latitude = 5Â°, Î” spring surface temperature = 9Â°C). The results will be used to assess how regional palaeo-temperature (Uk37), palaeo-moisture (Î´Dwax) and palaeo-evaporation (Î´Dalgal) respond during times of past global warmth (e.g., Medieval Warm Period, 900-1200 AD) to find an accurate analogue for assessing future drought risk in the interior of Canada.",2015-04-01,2020-03-31,940883.0,,['biofuel'],1,1

The development of this new business approach is based on three major issues, namely (i) design of customer oriented product-services for frugal innovation in a bottom-up development process, (ii) optimization of production systems and networks based on interaction of stakeholders, and (iii) planning and control of production networks and regional production systems to enable ad-hoc re-design. The three goals are enabled by innovative cloud-based product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions integrating production (shop-floor and supplier) as well as customer feedbacks using open IT-platforms and advanced multi-objective optimization methods in comprehensive decision support tools.
The application of the proposed methodology in any kind of globally engaging manufacturing company exploits potentials to shorten time-to-market of customized products as well as throughput times in globally distributed production tasks and reduce carbon footprint of global production networks.
The integration of the proposed innovative product-service into production networks will increase the attractiveness of European companies by offering new added value services that make their products more attractive (e.g. more individualized products and shorter time to market) to different customers segments especially for emerging regions by offering new frugal products earning a share of sales and by increasing customer satisfaction in terms of providing more power to the customer.

The general objective of RIBuild is to develop effective, comprehensive decision guidelines to optimise the design and implementation of internal thermal insulation in historic buildings across the EU. RIBuild focuses on heavy external walls made of stone, brick and timber framing, as most historic buildings are made of these materials. The general objective is achieved through three main activities
â€¢ To obtain a thorough knowledge level to characterise the eligibility of the building for a deep internal thermal insulation renovation. This knowledge is obtained through screening of historic buildings, investigation of material properties and threshold values for failure
â€¢ To determine the conditions under which different internal insulation measures are reliable and affordable measures based on probabilistic modelling of the hygrothermal performance, the environmental impact and the cost/benefit
â€¢ To develop a set of comprehensive decision guidelines  and a web-based assessment tool, which are demonstrated in a number of buildings. RIBuild addresses the most difficult retrofitting measure of historic buildings: internal thermal insulation. The adaption of knowledge developed by RIBuild contributes to sustainable historic buildings with improved energy efficiency implying an easier conversion of energy supply from inefficient fossil fuels to efficient renewable energy sources. RIBuild also assesses the hygrothermal performance of the building construction, thus no collateral damage occurs; in case of failure an easy roll back of the measures is possible.

1801,636808,O2RIGIN,From the origin of Earth's volatiles to atmospheric oxygenation,"Aim of this project is to understand the connection between endogenic and exogenic processes of our planet that led to the redox contrast between Earthâ€™s surface and interior. For this purpose the time constraints on atmospheric oxygenation can be refined and for the first time linked with a new approach to Earthâ€™s endogenic processes like plate tectonics, mantle melting, volcanism, continent formation and subduction-related sediment- and crust recycling. These objectives will be achieved by using the unique geochemical capabilities of the selenium (Se) isotope system to unlock the geological record of changing oxygen fugacities in the mantle-crust-atmosphere reservoirs. The power of the Se isotope system lies in its redox sensitivity and in the volatile and highly siderophile/chalcophile character of elemental Se. This links Se to the evolution of other volatiles during key geological processes from Earth formation ca. 4.5 Ga ago until today. The occurrence and behavior of Se is fully controlled by accessory micrometric sulfide minerals in the silicate Earth, which may conserve their original Se isotopic signatures over large geological timescales and can be dated via the 187Re-187Os geochronometer. This offers high resolutions in time and space that are groundbreaking for research on Earth System Oxygenation. Covering Earth geologic history, new high-precision Se isotope data of the sedimentary and representative mantle-derived magmatic rock record from all major plate tectonic settings will be combined with the mineral-scale record of robust and global â€œtime capsulesâ€ such as diamond inclusions. Once the evolution into todays dynamic Earthâ€™s Redox System is understood, the investigation will be pushed back in time to Earthâ€™s formation. This involves a reconciliation of the meteoritic and Archean rock and mineral-scale Se isotope record to constrain the origin of volatiles essential for the oceans, generation of an atmosphere and development of life on our planet.",2015-03-01,2021-02-28,1498353.0,,['recycling'],1,1
1802,714067,ENERGYMAPS,Revealing the electronic energy landscape of multi-layered (opto)electronic devices,"Modern optoelectronic (OE) devices such as light-emitting or photovoltaic diodes offer exciting opportunities for the future. A wide range of materials has been utilized in these devices, including among others: organic materials, inorganic quantum dots and hybrid perovskites. While the functionality, performance and device physics vary strongly from material to material and device to device, all OE devices depend on the energy levels of their individual components and the interaction of the electronic states at the various heterointerfaces. Lacking a method to map the energy levels in a device, energy level diagrams reported for most devices consist of a combination of individual energy levels for each material, which neglect interactions between the materials (that may cause interfacial dipoles and/or band bending) and do not represent the true energetic landscape. Despite this, they are routinely used for interpretation of device performance and physics.
This project aims to map the energy levels in real functional devices: revealing the true nature of buried interfaces, multilayers and contacts, and to answer fundamental long-standing questions in the field of OE, such as the origin of photovoltage losses and energetics of injection/extraction contacts of devices. We will develop and utilize a â€œUltra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) depth profilingâ€ technique based on the combination of UPS with Ar gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) etching that induces minimal surface damage, on a wide range of organic, inorganic and hybrid materials and devices. We will reveal the true energy level landscapes of devices and monitor their evolution throughout the device lifetime. Furthermore, we will explore the possibility to expand the use of GCIB etching beyond UPS as a new nanofabrication technique. These studies will open new frontiers in OE research and would allow the development of novel interface engineering approaches, device architectures and material design rules.",2017-09-01,2022-08-31,1497931.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1803,724424,No-LIMIT,Boosting Photovoltaic Performance by the Synergistic Interaction of Halide Perovskites and Semiconductor Quantum Dots,"Photovoltaic conversion has the extraordinary property of transforming the solar energy directly into electric power. However, the available electrical power is known to be severely limited by the so-called Shockley-Queisser (SQ) photoconversion limit. The maximum efficiency for a single absorber is limited as photons with energy lower than the bandgap (BG) cannot be absorbed, and just an energy equivalent to the BG can be used for photons with higher energy than the BG, due to thermalization. Tandem cells have overcome this SQ limit upon exploiting complex and expensive configurations. Alternative approaches, even with higher potentiality, as Intermediate Bandgap Solar Cells (IBSCs) have not reached the expected performance mainly due to the limitations introduced by the monocrystalline matrix. The incorporation of quantum dots (QD) to create the IB produces layer strain and defects that limit the cell performance. No-LIMIT proposes to revamp IBSCs concept, using polycrystalline halide perovskites (HP) host matrix in order to take benefit from the strain relaxation at polycrystalline materials and from HP benign defect physics. HPs show an outstanding performance even when they are grown in a porous structure, indicating that their excellent transport and recombination properties are preserved with embedded materials. No-LIMIT will exploit this potentiality by using the states of embedded QD as IB in IBSC with HP matrix. The project will focus on the preparation of HPs-QD systems with enhanced light collection efficiency preserving charge transport, recombination and stability. No-LIMIT will study the properties and interactions of the HP and QD materials developed, as well as injection, recombination and transport properties in the coupled system. The combination of these strategies will build a ground-breaking synergistic system able to break the SQ limit. The achievements of IBSC, together with the intermediate steps, will have a colossal impact on photovoltaics",2017-09-01,2022-08-31,1999071.53,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1804,727465,TAOIDE,Technology Advancement of Ocean energy devices through Innovative Development of Electrical systems to increase performance and reliability,"Life cycle cost of electricity generated by marine renewable technologies is determined by multiple factors including energy production capability, capital costs, and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs, as well as multiple other logistical, permitting, environmental, and finance cost factors. ORPCâ€™s direct experience has been that operating and maintenance costs are dominant in the cost structure. It is clear that for marine renewable energy systems to be commercially viable they must demonstrate exceptionally high reliability and availability. ORPC is now addressing these cost, efficiency and reliability issues in order to achieve commercial status. This Project is a critical next step in commercialization of ORPCâ€™s hydrokinetic power system technology for the European market. Ultimate Project goals are to develop a complete power transfer system from prime mover to electrical grid with normal maintenance intervals of greater than five years, and availability of greater than 98%. Intermediate goals are to deliver a system with design maintenance intervals of greater than five years, and availability greater than 96%. The projects primary objectives are listed below:
1. Develop wet gap electrical generator design capable of operating in seawater flooded condition
2. Develop advanced bearings and seal designs for hydrokinetic machines
3. Develop and implement control strategies to maximize power output and power quality for multiple prime mover designs

1805,708694,Toxoplasma sensing,Cytoplasmic sensing of Toxoplasma gondii infection and host cell programmed necrosis,"My goal is to understand how cell-autonomous immunity (CAI) can detect intracellular parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii in their membrane-bounded intracellular niches, how recognition induces necrosis of the host cell, and how host death signalling pathways contribute to inflammatory disorders. Although adaptive immunity ultimately contributes to host survival, the initial response is controlled by innate mechanisms. Mice rely primarily on IFNÎ³-induced CAI effectors virtually absent in humans, the immunity-related GTPases (IRGs). Parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane attack by IRGs results in parasite eviction and elimination, swiftly followed by regulated necrosis of the host cell. Preciously little is known about how parasite sensing drives cell death, particularly in (mouse and human) non-haematopoietic cells (NHCs) lacking the full antimicrobial arsenal of immune cells. Yet necrosis is key to limiting infection and driving parasite chronicity, while potentially eliciting immunopathology. I have 2 objectives: 1) the identification of the intracellular sensor(s) of T. gondii ligands and/or vacuole damage and 2) the dissection of the signalling pathway(s) leading to parasite/cell demise. Using a combination of genetic screens and cell biology tools, I will pinpoint PRR/necrosis genes involved. Elucidating these signalling pathways will help direct therapeutic interventions relevant for toxoplasmosis and inflammatory diseases. This proposal and accompanying career development plan, to be supervised by Prof. Jonathan C. Howard and hosted by the IGC, will be fostered by a dynamic research environment and crucial collaborations that will enable me to receive the necessary training and transferrable skills to establish my own lab. In turn, my extensive training in host-pathogen interactions will greatly benefit this project and the IGC, potentiating integration of knowledge/expertise.",2016-07-01,2019-01-29,160635.6,,['PV'],1,1

Energy efficient solution for cooling telecommunication data centers,"The information and telecommunication sectors are responsible for up to 2% of the global green-house gas emissions. Data centres and telco sites run 24/7. The cooling system alone may account for up to 40% in average of the energy demands of a data centre, resulting in a significant cost factor to owners and operators, especially for telecommunication service providers. Our company, HeatVentors Ltd, invented and patented HeatTANK, an innovative solution that can be used to optimise cooling process by storing cooling energy in phase change materials (PCM) in a controlled and optimised way. Our solution will complement or even replace conventional compressor-based air conditioners for data centres. Our pilot project results showed that using HeatTANK reduces the cooling costs of a telecommunication site by 54% with 3,96 years ROI. The leading actors of telecommunication and energy sector expressed their interest to our solution, such as IBM, Vodafone, T-Systems from ICT industry as well as MVM and E.ON from the energy sectors. According to the pre-orders, we will step to the Hungarian market in 2019 Q2 and to the international market in 2019 Q4.

1807,835067,DIATOMIC,Untangling eco-evolutionary impacts on diatom genomes over timescales relevant to current climate change,"Diatoms are major contributors of primary production in the ocean and participate in carbon sequestration over geologically relevant timescales. As key components of the Earthâ€™s carbon cycle and marine food webs we need to understand the eco-evolutionary underpinnings of their ecological success to forecast their fate in a future ocean impacted by anthropogenic change. Genomes and epigenomes from model diatoms, as well as hundreds of transcriptomes from multiple species, have revealed genetic and epigenetic processes regulating gene expression in response to changing environments. The Tara Oceans survey has in parallel generated resources to explore diatom abundance, diversity and gene expression in the worldâ€™s ocean in widely contrasting conditions. DIATOMIC will build on these resources to understand how evolutionary and ecological processes combine to influence diatom adaptations to their environment at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. To examine these processes over timescales relevant to current climate change, DIATOMIC includes the pioneering exploration of ancient diatom DNA from the sub-seafloor to reveal the genetic and epigenetic bases of speciation and adaptation that have impacted their ecological success during the last 100,000 years, when Earth experienced major climatological events and an increase in anthropogenic impacts. As a model for exploring eco-evolutionary processes in the past and contemporary ocean we will focus primarily on Chaetoceros because this diatom genus is ancient, ubiquitous, abundant and contributes significantly to carbon export. Key findings will be additionally supported by lab-based studies using the diatom Phaeodactylum for which exemplar molecular tools exist. Specifically, the project will address:
1. What molecular features characterize genome evolution in diatoms?
2. Which processes determine diatom metapopulation structure?
3. What can ancient DNA tell us about diatom adaptations to environmental change in the past?",2019-11-01,2024-10-31,2495753.0,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

Building trusted virtual models for structures subject to high dynamic loads is a process we call â€œdynamic virtualisationâ€. All the ESRâ€™s who receive training through this network will (i) obtain a PhD from an internationally recognised University, (ii) gain experience of applying their research skills in non-academic organisations, and (iii) receive training in transferable skills such commercialisation and communication. The network will be run as part of the Open Data Project giving maximum research impact through open access publications, data, software and public engagement. The research carried out through this network will go beyond the now ubiquitous process of creating computer based simulation models of structural dynamics. Obtaining a valuable virtual model is no longer a question of computing power, but now rests in the more difficult problem of developing trust in the model through the process of verification and validation (V & V). The challenges are perhaps most obvious in the renewable energy sector, where technology is developing at a very rapid pace, and more reliable models are required to cope with structures subjected to extreme loadings which lead to a high degree of nonlinearity, and uncertainties. Applying our research to such problems will be accelerated by close interaction with the industrial partners in the network, with whom we intend to maintain and enhance an innovation focused relationship. This will result in a training network where ESRâ€™s are able to be creative, entrepreneurial and innovative whilst receiving state of the art training that will enable them to deal with future challenges in this important area of engineering.",2018-02-01,2022-01-31,3589794.64,,['renewable energy'],1,1
1809,714737,single-C,Automatized Catalysis and Single-Carbon Insertion,"This project is aimed at accelerating the synthesis of important organic molecules through key enabling technologies towards automatized catalysis and single-carbon insertion reactions. Transferring the simplest carbon units to organic molecules has the potential to change the way we approach synthesis planning through new asymmetric skeletal homologations and rearrangements of simple raw materials, for which only long workarounds exist now. These methods can reduce to half the manipulations required to access relevant medicines, organocatalysts, ligands, bio-molecular tools and photovoltaic devices. They target unreactive functions to introduce fundamental one-carbon units (CO or C) that are present in virtually any organic compound. New powerful reagents that resemble these basic single-carbon units in excited electronic configurations are to be developed for this purpose. The new catalytic methods needed are based on the solid grounds of carbene-transfer reactions and the recent advances of my group in the development of new homogeneous catalysts. Moreover, a new catalyst platform will be developed to complement our existing portfolio for success in the challenging processes targeted in this proposal. We aim to pioneer a fully automatized workflow for research in catalysis that devoid the synthesis of organic ligands replacing them by combinatorial assemblies built in situ from un-structured simple molecules. The new reactions arising from these new catalysts and reagents will expedite the valorization of raw materials (such as carbonyls, olefins and hydrocarbons) into important chiral molecules in a single transformation. This bold aim is a priority of the European Commission for the coming years as it will save time, protect the environment and reduce cost at once. Thus, these innovative technologies have the potential of transforming the research workflow in homogeneous catalysis and the logics of retrosynthesis of organic molecules at a fundamental level.",2017-04-01,2022-03-31,1487245.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1810,797350,PLIMPine,Pine protection against Pitch canker through genetic resistance and plant immunization,"Pinus is one of the most ecologically and economically significant tree genera in the world having an extreme economic importance to wood and paper industries. Pine pitch canker, caused by the fungus Fusarium circinatum, is an introduced non-native pine disease in natural and planted stands of Europe subject to quarantine measures. To date, there are no suitable approaches available to control this threat, being associated with elevated economic losses to the forestry sector. â€œPlant immunizationâ€ or priming, is pointed as the safest and most effective biotechnological approach to boost the endogenous plant immune system. Phosphites (Phi) have been shown to activate plant resistance acting in a dual way, both at the host and fungus level. PlimPine project has been built on the basis of ecological, industrial and socioeconomic importance of European pine forests, combined with the fact that short research is conducted on F. circinatum in Europe. We propose a substantially cross-disciplinary (from physiology to Omics) and ambitious, but feasible, project to create knowledge and tools to explore the intricate defence system against pathogens for forest trees, having Pinus-Fusarium interaction as a model. This project aims to characterize and identify markers of resistance (natural or induced) to pitch canker disease based on solid and exciting preliminary results. Deciphering the mode of action of Phi will help in the preventive application as a viable alternative for the pitch canker management, contributing to the European forest management.",2018-08-01,2020-07-31,148635.6,,['forest management'],1,1
1811,682707,ECOHERB,Drivers and impacts of invertebrate herbivores across forest ecosystems globally.,"Forests slow global climate change by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide but this ecosystem service is limited by soil nutrients. Herbivores potentially alter soil nutrients in a range of ways, but these have mostly only been recorded for large mammals. By comparison, the impacts of the abundant invertebrates in forests have largely been ignored and are not included in current models used to generate the climate predictions so vital for designing governmental policies
The proposed project will use a pioneering new interdisciplinary approach to provide the most complete picture yet available of the rates, underlying drivers and ultimate impacts of key nutrient inputs from invertebrate herbivores across forest ecosystems worldwide. Specifically, we will:

(1) Establish a network of herbivory monitoring stations across all major forest types, and across key environmental gradients (temperature, rainfall, ecosystem development).
(2) Perform laboratory experiments to examine the effects of herbivore excreta on soil processes under different temperature and moisture conditions.
(3) Integrate this information into a cutting-edge ecosystem model, to generate more accurate predictions of forest carbon sequestration under future climate change.

The network established will form the foundation for a unique long-term global monitoring effort which we intend to continue long after the current funding time scale. This work represents a powerful blend of several disciplines harnessing an array of cutting edge tools to provide fundamentally novel insights into an area of direct and urgent importance for the society.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,1750000.0,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1
1812,678151,TROJANANOHORSE,Hybrid immune-eluding nanocrystals as smart and active theranostic weapons against cancer,"Nanomedicine tools for cancer treatment comprise many nanosized systems, so far developed with smart functions such as efficient drug delivery and cell targeting abilities. However they remain still under-characterized in terms of immunogenicity, potential toxicity due to the materials itself or the unwanted release of drugs. To overcome these challenges this project aims to develop a new generation of multifunctional therapeutic and diagnostic (thus theranostics) nanosystems displaying non-immunogenicity, improved cancer treatment, cell imaging, and high safety for the hosting organism. The innovative concept behind this approach relies on a TrojaNanoHorse (TNH) system, here validated against leukaemia. The injectable TNH have a biomimetic non-immunogenic shell. Studies will show the intrinsic therapeutic activity of the nanocrystalline core for cancer killing, without the use of chemotherapeutic drugs, and its light emission. The hemocompatibility, anti-thrombogenicity, and targeting ability toward malignant blood cells will be proved during this project. The whole TNH would go beyond the state-of-the-art due to its biomimetic shell, absence of drugs, its safety and biodegrading fate, and light emissions for diagnosis. This project will also develop novel set-up for based therapy and diagnosis, impacting on future technology, new standardized protocols for nanomaterial safety assessment, and study chemical and biological mechanism of cancer cell killing. Achieving the ultimate goal of a multifunctional TNH will require multidisciplinary expertise in chemistry, material science, biology, medicine and engineering, opening new horizons as nanomedicine tools for efficient cancer therapy with strong scientific, technological and socio-economic benefits.",2016-03-01,2021-02-28,1489219.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,1

CASCADE-X proposes an ultimate approach to directly convert CO2 to light olefins through cascade reactions over a bi-functional catalyst, obtained by molecular scale integration of an active metal alloy for the CO2-to-methanol reaction onto a zeotype catalyst for selective methanol-to-olefins conversion. Such a single-reactor cascade approach enables a simplified process scheme while overcoming the thermodynamic restrictions of the methanol synthesis by its sequential conversion. The action will generate fundamental knowledge on properties-performances relationships for the combined system, providing a rational for the optimization of catalyst and process conditions, as well as an improved understanding of key fundamental issues in both hydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins chemistry (restructuring, deactivation mechanisms, confinement effects). These goals will be pursued by an â€˜all-X-rayâ€™ approach, synergizing in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and diffraction/scattering at the laboratory and large-scale facility level in combination with complementary physico-chemical methods, to identify activity/selectivity/stability descriptors for the bifunctional catalyst. Multi-modal synchrotron nano-mapping of individual catalyst particles will elucidate the space-resolved dynamics of restructuring and deactivation phenomena. Integrating the applicantâ€™s experience in X-ray spectroscopy, the Hostâ€™s excellence in structural analysis, testing and rational optimization of zeotype catalysts, as well as the industrial know-how of the private sector partner (a leading Company in recycling and manufacturing precious metal catalysts, where a Secondment is planned), CASCADE-X provides a unique platform to diversify the proponentâ€™s individual competences and to promote trans-sectoral knowledge transfer.",2018-07-01,2020-06-30,196400.4,,['recycling'],1,1
1814,721975,in3,An integrated interdisciplinary approach to animal-free chemical and nanomaterial safety assessment,"All chemicals whether they are drugs, cosmetics, agrochemicals or others need to be tested for their safety to man and the environment. The use of whole animal studies for the prediction of adverse effects in man, is problematic due to species dependent effects, high costs and a large burden to animals in terms of numbers and suffering.  While there have been major improvements in human in vitro and in silico techniques, there is still a lack of an integrated risk assessment platform. The in3 proposal aims to significantly further the development of animal-free chemical and nanomaterial (NM) safety evaluation by creating a scientific and training program aimed at integrating human in vitro testing with computational approaches. The project will focus on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived tissues, including liver, kidney, brain, lung and vasculature and to utilise mechanistic toxicology, quantitative adverse outcome pathways, biokinetics, cheminformatics and modelling approaches to derive testable prediction models. hiPSC present the major advantages provide non-cancerous derived tissues with identical genetic backgrounds. All Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) will work towards the same goal, utilising the same chemicals, donor cells, assays and software packages. All data will be centrally housed in standardised formats, appropriately annotated and linked with protocols and material information. While ESRs will hone their skills in their own field of expertise, they will also collaborate to create an in depth safety evaluation testing platform for the chosen test compounds. By interaction, problem solving, training and secondments over the three years, they will acquire a unique set of interdisciplinary skills for chemical and NM safety assessment. The project aims to accelerate the realisation of animal-free safety assessment and to graduate 15 PhD students with the ideal skill sets to carry out the strategy designed in in3 in the near future.",2017-01-01,2020-12-31,3860843.4,,['nanomaterial'],1,1

From fundamentals of nanozymes to applications based on gas-diffusion electrodes,"Nanoparticles with etched substrate channels are proposed as a simplified enzyme mimic, nanozymes, for electrocatalysis providing concave catalytically active sites together with the local modulation of electrolyte composition. This concept will be extended to bimetallic core-shell structures with etched channels to provide locally confined catalyst surfaces with varying selectivity. The first catalytic reaction at the channel entrance selectively generates a product, which is further converted in a follow-up reaction catalysed at the core material at the bottom of the channel. The endeavour to locally assemble catalysts with different properties in nano-confined reaction volumes to actualise cascade reaction pathways will be extended to layered nanoparticle structures. Together with an anisotropic provision of a gaseous reactant through a hydrophobic/hydrophilic phase boundary of specifically designed gas diffusion electrodes multi-step catalytic cascade reactions become feasible. The development and extensive evaluation of multi-catalyst gas-diffusion electrodes using operando electrochemistry/spectroscopy and nano-electrochemical tools as well as multi flow-through electrolysers will provide the fundamental knowledge concerning the relative location of different catalyst particles, which synergistically perform chemical cascade reaction with high selectivity and at high current densities. These gas-diffusion electrodes will be integrated in novel electrolyser concepts targeting CO2 recycling at high current density in alkaline solution under suppression of H2 competition with previously unprecedented selectivity for the formation of higher hydrocarbons envisioning contributions to a closed carbon cycle economy and a substantial decrease of CO2 emission. Additionally, a novel tree-type rotating electrolyser design is proposed for the removal of hazardous gaseous pollutants from air e.g. at street crossings in cities as exemplified by NOx reduction to N2 or NH3.",2019-09-01,2024-08-31,2499462.0,,['recycling'],1,1
1817,820331,PROMPT,PRemature Obsolescence Multi-Stakeholder Product Testing Program,"Waste production and resource use is increasing for electric and electronic consumer products. At the same time many critical materials cannot be recovered in recycling processes. Therefore a promising strategy would be to lengthen the lifetimes of these products in order to get closer to a Circular Economy.

The project PROMPT is going to support the development of more durable and longer lasting products by lowering the asymmetry of information between consumer and manufacturer and thereby to allow consumers to make better choices. This is achieved by the development of an integral testing programme for electric and electronic consumer products that takes into account the main key issues of product failures and premature obsolescence: 
â€¢	Product durability and reliability 
â€¢	Adaptability, upgradability, and reparability 
â€¢	User behaviour and market 

PROMPT takes a multi-stakeholder approach by including different consumer, test, repair and research organisations in the consortium who will carry out the work. Consequently, results will be achieved that are viable for different stakeholders and independent from manufacturers. With the help of an Advisory Board, additional stakeholder input will be gathered. The board will consist of experts from industry, retail, design, environmental, science and consumer sectors. 

A baseline of research will be established by collecting empirical data on technical issues, design shortcomings, market obstacles and replacement causes for premature obsolescence. These results will give input to the development of a range of specific testing methods addressing the three fields of issues outlined above. The results will be synthesized in an integral testing programme for premature obsolescence that will be validated and benchmarked through test cases.

We will use this receptor family as an example with which to develop a ground-breaking new technology to study cellular signaling towards atomic resolution, in situ. Therefore, we propose to employ an interdisciplinary approach for studying EGFR family of receptors, where we follow their conformational and oligomeric states as well as bound ligands and signal transduction molecules during different activation states at atomic resolution in situ. We will progress from engineered to native receptor forms, and from defined membrane vesicles to whole cells, and employ 3D structure analysis by cryo-electron tomography, greatly enhanced by novel image processing approaches, mass spectroscopy definitions of receptor modifications and interaction partners, as well as advanced protein engineering to identify, orient and freeze receptors for this method development. This collaborative project addresses the properties of the EGFR family across a wide range of complexity and dimensions, in the cellular environment, through their high-resolution structures and changes during receptor recycling. This collaborative network, addressing EGFR from complementary angles, is most likely to generate substantial new information on these assemblies and to yield a deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying their structure and function. The EGFR family has been the focus of many tumor therapies, with the aim of intercepting their signaling, and this project will contribute to a more detailed understanding of their mode of action and thus the more rational development of such therapies in the future. However, the technology that will be developed will be generally applicable and may thus help to contribute to a paradigm change for structural biology, enabling atomic resolution description of receptors in their cellular environment.",2019-03-01,2024-02-29,8273457.0,,['recycling'],1,1

By making use of differences in surface properties between  minerals, valuable particles are concentrated in large tanks by attaching to bubbles, which form a froth phase that overflows as a mineral-rich concentrate. However, current flotation technologies do not work adequately for fine particles, below 20 Âµm in size. This is a serious challenge at present limiting the exploitation of deposits and proper recycling of end of life products containing Critical Raw Materials (CRM). This FineFuture project will advance the fundamental understanding of fine particle flotation phenomena, which will lead to the development of ground-breaking technological solutions. This will not only help unlock new CRM deposits but also contribute to increase the resource and energy efficiency of current operations where the fines are lost to tailings. FineFuture will also enable proper reprocessing of old tailings deposits and be technology-transferred to other raw material particle-based processes within the circular economy, thus leading the way in the sustainable use of resources. For the EU industry the ability to float fine particles will be fundamental in securing access to raw materials in the future, yet to date there is no large scale collaborative effort to achieve this. The FineFuture consortium brings together an industry- and user-driven multidisciplinary team with the skills and experience required to tackle the challenging objectives set up for this project. Through a first of its kind research approach, the consortiumâ€™s combined expertise in science, engineering and industrial practice will allow a robust and knowledge-based development of innovative fine particle flotation technologies.

This is mainly due to their superior price-efficiency balance. Nevertheless, proven toxicity and carcinogenic effects related with their use have raised growing health concerns. To put these dangerous practices aside the need of economical biodegradable and non-toxic pads to compete with the synthetic ones are on the rise.
Cellsorb introduces a totally safe (i.e. non-toxic) closed food pad made from bioplastics and superabsorbent micro-cellulose material with the following superior features: 1) Absorbs multiple times its own weight similar with the performance of synthetic food pads, 2) It is fully compostable and 100% renewable, and 3) Competitive pricing over synthetic made food pads. Its uniqueness lies on our innovative production method able to produce microcellulose materials from pulp, creating a non-toxic and biodegradable superabsorbent able to compete in cost-effectiveness with current synthetic ones.",2019-05-01,2019-08-31,50000.0,,['SAPS'],1,1
1823,831966,PROTEUSS,Pressurised Rotational Oil Transfer â€“ Experimental Unit & System,"With the drive for engine cores to become smaller in size whilst operating at ever greater speeds and loads, the demands placed on the transmission systems are becoming ever greater. 

Correspondingly, effective lubrication, liquid cooling and hydraulic actuation are increasingly essential to the performance and life span of engine transmission systems. 

The above general trends, coupled with a recent resurgence of interest in open rotor engines, propel a need for new Oil Transfer Bearings (OTBs) to be developed. OTBs are required for two main reasons: 
(a) to provide both lubrication to bearings of planetary gears when the carrier of an epicyclic gearbox rotates and 
(b) to actuate movable objects on the rotating frame such as a blade pitch mechanism. 

The proposed experimental rig and supporting computational model will investigate both of these conditions simultaneously.

UNOTT is well placed to carry out this work due to its experience in delivering high quality research relevant to bearings, seals, shafts and other parts of the gas turbine transmissions system that have become a feature in all recent engine development programmes at Rolls-Royce. This is an area of focus for the Gas Turbines and Transmissions Research Centre, which included a significant investment in research facilities that would allow research in this area of long-term strength at UNOTT to deliver benefits to the wider engines community and contribute to the global challenges we face to reduce noise and emissions.",2019-06-01,2022-05-31,2271333.75,,['gas turbine'],1,1

According to the European Parliament buildings today are responsible for 36% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Europe, and so Directive on the energy performance of buildings requires all new buildings to be near zero-energy consumption from 2020 onwards. However, the old buildings refurbishment remains the main challenge. From the consumer perspective, increasing electricity prices create a challenge for both households and business budgets. Therefore, private solar photovoltaic electricity becomes very popular in developed market as its price decreases, but there is no efficient solution for those without sufficient roof or land area. On other hand smart shading solutions are also in demand as they not only increase life quality and working efficiency but can also contribute to buildings' energy efficiency decreasing electricity bill. However, on the existing market there is a lack of affordable, easily compatible exterior smart home and smart office shading solutions. SolarGaps creates unique value by executing two functions simultaneously: saving up to 30% of electricity bill (as a shading and a solar energy generation device), while enhancing life quality for B2C clients and creating pleasant working environment for B2B customers. 
Currently, SolarGaps has fully functional B2C product and is collecting feedback. Thus, objective of the Phase 2 project is to complete the technological and commercial development of the powerful B2B smart solar blinds system, set-up and test pilot production infrastructure, validate the SolarGaps smart solar blinds performance during the piloting with B2B customer and bring the product to the

Non-ferrous metal-based coatings are well known pre-treatments but due to environmental concerns and legislations (i.e. REACH), their use has been drastically restricted. The industrial community, pushed by these legislations, has been long demanding an economically viable and eco-friendly pre-treatment coating alternative, without having to compromise on the durability and corrosion performance of the overall coating system. With its outstanding properties, graphene appears as a promising alternative for non-ferrous metals in the coating market, having the potential to provide corrosion protection even when applied in thicknesses of a few nanometers. But the new graphene industry faces still crucial challenges, mainly production cost, quality and consistency. 
Our company, Carbon Waters, has developed a unique, patented, extremely controllable technique of chemical super-exfoliation to produce GRAPHENE WATER, which consists on dispersing few-layer graphene in water, without using additives and at a competitive cost. Its advantages face to competitors are unprecedented: our high-quality graphene dispersion allows for a stabilized, safe, homogeneous effect on the treated surfaces, ensuring optimum performance. Within this project, we aim to bring our current developments on graphene based anti-corrosive coatings to industrial applications and market readiness (TRL9). With GRAPHENE WATER, Carbon Waters will provide to the EU metal industries an eco-friendly alternative for surface protection, allowing them to commit with the regulatory framework without jeopardizing cost-competitiveness.

Several predecessor projects are the basis for the availability of the first generation of European based GaN-devices, also revealing that the challenges of these technologies have been heavily underestimated. This makes the high potential of GaN clearly evident to overcome the persisting threats of higher electric fields, current densities and power densities related to the necessity of device shrinkage. 
The new concept of following a vertical approach to address research through the entire supply chain of technology, packaging, reliability and application will enable a significant improvement of efficiency that goes beyond the limits of silicon based semiconductors in combination with packages that fully utilize the shrink-path of power GaN devices and which are not ready as of today.
UltimateGaNâ€™s unique approach addresses, among others, the following innovative applications with the scope to enable digitalisation and energy efficiency for 5G, Smart Grids and Smart Mobility that goes hand in hand with a significant reduction of the CO2 footprint:
â€¢Extremely efficient server power supply enabling lower energy consumption in data centres 
â€¢Benchmark Photovoltaic inverters in terms of efficiency and size to foster the use of renewable energies 
â€¢Affordable 5G-Amplifiers up to mm-wave enabling a faster 5G rollout

The current fragmentation in energy systems and an increasing share of intermittent energy ask for solutions providing integration and flexibility in the system. AMBITION targets the challenge of system flexibility by integrating (i.e. creating a bridge between) two forms of energy carriers, e.g. grid electricity and biofuels. Further, CO2 from current energy systems and industrial production can to be utilized as an alternative carbon source as an alternative to sequestration. The project targets a limited set of specific aspects (topics) of the integration challenge, which are in line with the priority areas identified in the SET plan Integrated Roadmap.

They represent â€˜hotspotsâ€™ of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the hostile conditions, mud volcanos harbour very unique microbial communities involved in the cycling of elements like carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, and nitrogen. Microbial communities in extreme environments are characterized by low biodiversity and as a consequence serve as good models to study linkages between genomic potential and environmental parameters. Metagenome studies have shown that most of the microorganisms in extreme environments are only distantly related to cultivated bacteria. Therefore, state-of the-art enrichment techniques using chemostat and sequencing batch cultivation with inocula from geothermal sites and driven by physiological information from metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data have a high potential to result in novel isolates. This was already demonstrated by our isolation of both mesophilic and thermophilic acid-loving methanotrophs. The aim of this project is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the microbial ecology of extremely acid terrestrial mud volcanos with special emphasis on the elemental cycles of sulfur, methane and nitrogen. After identification and isolation, the microbial key players will be investigated to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which they adapt to extreme (thermo)acidophilic conditions. To achieve this, several parallel and complementary state-of-the-art-approaches will be combined, e.g. meta-omics, microbial ecophysiology, cultivation techniques, cell biology/biochemistry, metabolism/gene expression studies.

These losses can account for up to 10-30 % of the device power consumption under high power conditions, and thereby dramatically reduce the efficiency of solar energy harvesting and general lighting, whose efficiencies â€“ apart from the resistive losses â€“ are gradually closing in on their theoretical limits. In ZeroR we make use of a conceptually simple but functionally dramatic modification to the previous buried active region (AR) devices, like LEDs, lasers and solar cells, by relocating the AR to outside the pn-junction, allowing e.g. locating the AR on the device surface â€“ or locating all the contact structures fully on one side of the active region, eventually enabling a fully scalable and essentially resistance free structures. We analyze the commercial prospects of the technology and show that it provides new freedom for high power semiconductor device design. The main goal of ZeroR is to facilitate further commercial development of the concept and to demonstrate the elimination of resistive losses in industrially relevant LED and solar cell prototypes using gallium nitride and gallium arsenide based compound semiconductor material systems.  If successful, this approach can substantially increase the device efficiency at selected high power operating conditions and substantially expedite the ongoing solid state lighting revolution and market penetration, also providing more efficient new solutions for solar energy harvesting and selected other applications.",2019-01-01,2020-06-30,150000.0,,['solar cell'],1,1

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, we know that fundamental scalars exist and it is timely to explore the Axion/ALP parameter space more intensively. A look at the allowed axion/ALP parameter space makes it clear that these might exist at low mass (below few eV), as (part of) Dark Matter. Alternatively they might exist at higher mass, above roughly the MeV scale, potentially as a Dark Matter mediator particle. AxScale explores parts of these different mass regions, with complementary techniques but with one research team. 
Firstly, with RADES, it develops a novel  concept for a filter-like cavity for the search of QCD axion Dark matter at a few tens of a micro-eV. Dark Matter Axions can be discovered by their resonant conversion in that cavity embedded in a strong magnetic field. The `classical axion window' has recently received much interest from cosmological model-building and I will implement a novel cavity concept that will allow to explore this Dark Matter parameter region. 
Secondly, AxScale searches for axions and ALPs using the NA62 detector at CERN's SPS. Especially the mass region above a few MeV can be efficiently searched by the use of a proton fixed-target facility. During nominal data taking NA62 investigates a Kaon beam. NA62 can also run in a mode in which its primary proton beam is fully dumped. With the resulting high interaction rate, the existence of weakly coupled particles can be efficiently probed. Thus, searches for  ALPs from Kaon decays as well as from production in dumped protons with NA62 are foreseen in AxScale. More generally, NA62 can look for a plethora of `Dark Sector' particles with recorded and future data.

Enzymes can substitute harsh and energy-demanding chemical treatments for sustainable production of bio-based building blocks and products in wood biorefinery. However, wild enzymes, evolved to act under natural environmental conditions, cannot be integrated into the current industrial processes. WoodZymes partners already have available extremozymes resisting very high temperature and pH that will be further optimized to be used as biocatalysts in wood industries. Enzyme application will include the recovery of phenolic compounds from enzymatic breakdown of technical lignin, and of lignin and hemicellulose compounds from enzymatic delignification and bleaching of kraft pulp (also resulting in more sustainable final cellulosic pulp). Extremophilic enzymes will also be used to valorize the latter compounds as bio-based precursors for adhesives in the manufacture of medium-density fiberboards, and as components of insulation polyurethane foams (substituting fossil building blocks), as well as for obtaining renewable sugar-based papermaking additives. WoodZymes illustrates the potential of extremozymes in the global bio-based economy, contributing to the sustainability and competitiveness of cellulose and board/polyurethane manufacture (as suggested by techno-economic and environmental analyses), and establishing a direct link between the pulp and wood industrial sectors. The feasibility of these objectives is based on a consortium from four EU countries formed by: i) four world-leading companies of the above industrial sectors; ii) a highly-active biotech SME commercializing extremophilic enzymes; and iii) four reputed research institutes of the wood, cellulose, lignin and enzymes sectors, being able to demonstrate the extremozyme-based technology at the pilot scale.",2018-06-01,2021-05-31,3253873.75,,['biorefinery'],1,1

The use of recently discovered bacterial lipid rafts to confine the reactions is expected to greatly improve the production levels, when comparing with traditional systems. We will now further improve the yields of synthesis by generating gain of function mutants of B. subtilis flotillin (FloA), a key-role player in lipid rafts scaffolding. These Superflotillins or Flo* will organize more stable, robust and functional rafts. Therefore, they will confine more complex biosynthesis pathways with more enzymes and improve the production yields. We will then test the efficiency of these improved mutants in biosynthesis of biofuels.

Industries such as steel making, fertilizer production, chemical and petrochemical refining or glass making, already use hydrogen as feedstock or high heat for various ends. However, most of the production processes involve carbon-based energy sources and are highly polluting, contributing abundantly to global GHG emissions. Overall, industry was responsible of over 25% of the GHG emissions in Europe in 2015. The use of renewable hydrogen could reduce 20% of global CO2 emissions by 2050. 
In Hydrogenics, we have developed HyLYZER, an innovative industrial scale electrolyser, based on PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) technology, that generates on-site clean high purity hydrogen with zero-emissions from renewable energy sources at unmatched efficiency: 85% average at stack level. Our solution's impact in the reduction of GHG emission can be quantified as 1ton of H2 abating 10tons of CO2.

1841,801464,SPRINT,Ultra-versatile Structural PRINTing of amorphous and tuned crystalline matter on multiple substrates,"Thin film deposition methods are crucial to generate progress in Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) of strategic importance for Europe, including Advanced Materials, Nanotechnology, Micro- and Nanoelectronics, Biotechnology, and Photonics. Devices like photovoltaic cells, light emitting diodes, electronic and optoelectronic micro-/nano-sensors are prominent examples of thin film applications where the precise control of material deposition and its degree of order (crystallinity) are of paramount importance for their performance and function. However, technologies for thin film deposition have very limited capacity to tune the material crystallinity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, or to create functional 3D architectures in a single and versatile manner. The requirement of high temperatures and vacuum conditions make them inherently costly and unsuitable for deposition on various substrates (e.g. plastics). Moreover, their dimensions are not compatible with miniaturization and integration in table-top interfaces that would broaden their potential use. These limitations restrain the development of ground-breaking functional materials and new-conceptual devices. The absence of a radically new deposition technology hampers innovation and the appearance of new and cost-effective marketable products. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop a radically new deposition technology to overcome these limitations, and that is at the core of the SPRINT project. SPRINT will develop a universal deposition technology of amorphous and tuned crystalline matter on multiple substrates, at room temperature and pressure. This technology not only combines the benefits of existing advanced deposition methods, at significantly lower cost and higher deposition rates, but also goes beyond the state-of-the-art in advanced materials development, to open new roadmaps to a plethora of future devices and applications.",2018-09-01,2022-08-31,2999997.5,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1842,725561,BigFastData,Charting a New Horizon of Big and Fast Data Analysis through Integrated Algorithm Design,"This proposal addresses a pressing need from emerging big data applications such as genomics and data center monitoring: besides the scale of processing, big data systems must also enable perpetual, low-latency processing for a broad set of analytical tasks, referred to as big and fast data analysis. Todayâ€™s technology falls severely short for such needs due to the lack of support of complex analytics with scale, low latency, and strong guarantees of user performance requirements. To bridge the gap, this proposal tackles a grand challenge: â€œHow do we design an algorithmic foundation that enables the development of all necessary pillars of big and fast data analysis?â€ This proposal considers three pillars:  
1) Parallelism: There is a fundamental tension between data parallelism (for scale) and pipeline parallelism (for low latency). We propose new approaches based on intelligent use of memory and workload properties to integrate both forms of parallelism.
2) Analytics: The literature lacks a large body of algorithms for critical order-related analytics to be run under data and pipeline parallelism. We propose new algorithmic frameworks to enable such analytics.
3) Optimization: To run analytics, today's big data systems are best effort only. We transform such systems into a principled optimization framework that suits the new characteristics of big data infrastructure and adapts to meet user performance requirements.

The scale and complexity of the proposed algorithm design makes this project high-risk, at the same time, high-gain: it will lay a solid foundation for big and fast data analysis, enabling a new integrated parallel processing paradigm, algorithms for critical order-related analytics, and a principled optimizer with strong performance guarantees. It will also broadly enable accelerated information discovery in emerging domains such as genomics, as well as economic benefits of early, well-informed decisions and reduced user payments.",2017-09-01,2022-08-31,2472752.0,,['data center'],1,1
1843,755458,TRADE,Turbo electRic Aircraft Design Environment (TRADE),"The improvement potential in conventional aero engines will be realized over the next decades. While a number of evolutionary improvements remain, the limits to thermal efficiency are becoming visible in terms of material constraints, NOx emissions and engine operability. The propulsive efficiency improvement potential is also small and constrained by transmission losses, nacelle and intake drag, engine weight and - for open-rotors - by noise and integration challenges. If the continuous increase in air travel is to become sustainable - as the ACARE 2020 and Flightpath 2050 goals require - then a revolutionary step change in aircraft technology is required.

Current aircraft/engine conceptual design methodologies are centered on the disciplines of aerodynamics, structures, and gas turbine performance. Key aspects of unconventional concepts - such as hybrid electric propulsion - are thus hard to capture within existing design tools.

TRADE proposes the integration of three new aspects into aircraft/engine conceptual design. First, an advanced structural model quantifies the impact of the installation of heavy equipment on the sizing of the aircraft structure. Second, refined on-board system models capture design and performance trades in electric power systems, gas turbines, and thermal management. Finally, an operational and mission model enables flight dynamic analyses and an assessment of handling qualities of diverging aircraft configurations. All improvements build on extensive model assets of the consortium members.

TRADE also delivers the integration of these new aspects into a conceptual design environment. The environment is suitable for the design of hybrid electric aircraft, and the consortium will apply it for configuration assessment and optimization at sub-system as well as whole-aircraft level.

TRADE fulfills all the topic requirements of JTI-CS2-2016-CFP04-LPA-01-28, and opens the path to a technological breakthrough in the aeronautics community.",2017-09-01,2020-02-29,1500000.0,,['gas turbine'],1,1

The new market we are developing is a world first, sitting between manual manufacturing and full production line assembly. Neither existing solutions are cost effective with the current levels of EVs being produced.

Our solution is a fully automated final assembly cell, with 3 autonomous robots situated around a central industry build location. Our main innovation is our method of assembly, the 3 robots work symbiotically to assemble modules into finished products. This design provides a footprint that is 12 times smaller than traditional production lines. We have incorporated our state of the art gripper technology for fully adaptable programmable robotic heads that can accommodate 12 different design options, allowing assembly of small batches in a cost effective manner. Our modular format allows fully flexible manufacturing, appealing to the increasing customer demand for evermore customised products.

The high flexibility required to accommodate small series customised products alongside the commercial need to run a cost effective practice is challenging a number of manufacturing industries. When demonstrating the prototype at the Hannover Messe 2015, we received significant interest from a number of industries beyond the EV market including furniture and domestic appliances construction opening further opportunities for us to capitalise on.

Forecasted to have a global worth of â‚¬184 bn by 2020, the automation solutions industry is growing. During this Phase 2 project we intend to finalised our existing technology ahead of market launch, in order to achieve this we need to: refine the subsystems and software; develop gripper and sensor systems; obtain the relevant standards; build a demonstrator unit and trial in a commercial setting.

1845,749664,TEROPPLATE,Testing the role of thermo-chemical piles in the generation and continuation of plate tectonics,"The mechanics of plate tectonics (the movement of the Earth's surface) is a fundamental scientific question in understanding the recycling of mantle volatiles in processes that affect habitability. The emergence of plate tectonics on Earth set the planet apart from others in our solar system allowing for the propagation of life, yet the fundamentals of how it all began remain unresolved. Present-day geophysical imaging of the deep mantle show anomalous chemical piles thought to originate from the beginnings of Earth. Recently, consensus has been reached that the chemical piles can impact, and be impacted by, plate tectonic processes. However, their interaction with mantle convection in a pre-plate tectonic early Earth is not well known. In this study, state of the art numerical experiments will be designed and implemented to offer the first investigation into what role deep chemical heterogeneities play in the initial breaking of the lithosphere (to initiate a form of plate tectonics). Furthermore, a numerical analysis into the evolution of temperature and mantle dynamics in the early Earth will be conducted to assess a range of geodynamic scenarios previously hypothesized.  This fellowship is timely as it complements a number of recent developments in early Earth tectonics, numerical modelling, and in knowledge of thermo-chemical pile behaviour. 

Returning to the EU, the applicant will expand his ability to design, program, and develop  large-scale numerical models using high performance computing gained from doctoral and post-doctoral experiences in Canada. This project allows for the applicant to reintegrate into EU academia, and contribute his acquired research skills. The expertise of the contributors and the design of the research will provide the applicant with new knowledge and experience in early Earth geophysics and geochemistry.

Leaching of the organic solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) into groundwater has been identified as a primary issue with unlined landfills , affecting up to 70% of leachates tested. Mainly used as a metal degreaser and dry-cleaning reagent, TCE is difficult to treat; current treatment methods, such as anaerobic digestion  or air stripping , are ineffective and/or expensive. This project will investigate the use biochar, or other appropriate media, for treatment of TCE contaminated water via two technologies - permeable reactive interceptors (PRIs) and permeable contaminant retaining filter (PCRF) bags. This novel, low-cost solution will address the requirements of European Union (EU) legislation, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The project will be based at the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) with supervision by Dr Mark Healy (GeoEnvironmental Engineering Research Group â€“ GENE) and support from Dr Florence Abram (Functional Environmental Microbiology - FEM). As the applicant has experience in TCE treatment from a microbial background, this highly novel, interdisciplinary proposal will compliment and strengthen her existing skillset by approaching this technology from an engineering perspective, with support from a research group that has a strong track record in this research area. With detailed career development assistance, multiple opportunities to further her strong publication record, access to numerous and varied fora for dissemination of results and support for IP exploitation, this proposal will have a significant impact in reintegrating the applicant back into the EU research community from her current research position in New Zealand.",2017-07-10,2019-07-09,187866.0,,['biochar'],1,1
1847,754568,DMS,Dielectric MicroSpacer Technology,"Several technological applications need tools for keeping a stable micrometric distance between two surfaces. The requirements are more stringent if electrical insulation has to be guaranteed between the surfaces and even more if also thermal insulation has to be satisfied.
The dielectric microspacers (DMSs) here described represent a microtechnology able to meet all these requirements. DMSs were developed in the ProME3ThE2US2 FET project to separate two electrodes of an innovative high-temperature solar cell prototype. Since that device is part of the wider set of thermionic energy converters (TECs), DMS technology can be successfully applied to them, thus solving a technical problem only mitigated by palliative solutions during the last 50 years.
The potentials connected to DMS technological innovation are scalability, robustness, high resolution, fabrication on large areas, thermal resistance and stability, very high electric and thermal resistivity, uniformity of physical properties, versatility of arrangement, and very accurate control of the separation gap.
As mentioned, the immediate application is in TECs, initially for nuclear and aerospace applications and subsequently for allowing their introduction in the enormously increasing sector of industrial waste heat recovery. Application is expected also in fabrication of electronic devices. 
However, since new devices require effective and performing tools, in the same way as new tools open new perspectives for hi-tech devices, novel applications can be imagined. With this aim, DMS project starts with a critical study on possible complementary applications as well as on technical limitations and improvements. This activity will be preparatory for protecting the intellectual property in the widest possible application domain. A second phase will focus on technology transfer by qualifying and quantifying the possible market(s) and actors, aimed at defining an effective exploitation plan and promotion strategy.",2017-04-01,2018-09-30,100000.0,,['solar cell'],1,1

The internal structure of multi-component metal hybrids will be created simultaneously at two levels: nanostructuring each constituent while also architecturing helical macroscale features. 
This project aims on fundamental study of physical mechanisms triggered by simultaneous mixing and nanostructuring of immiscible metals by severe shear while producing new types of hybrid materials. Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) with rotating shear plane and variable inclination angle will be used for production of multicomponent materials to obtain properties not found in individual conventional materials. This will be achieved by â€˜architecturingâ€™ the inner structure of the hybrid with consideration of the interface bond and enhanced inter-diffusion under SPD. A model of a hybrid consisting of different constituents with intercalated boundary layers will be developed. A thrust of research is primarily directed at the barely investigated shape and length scale effects of the constituents on the resulting properties of the new material.

1851,786643,eCAPE,"New energy Consumer roles and smart technologies â€“ Actors, Practices and Equality","The transition to a low-carbon society is vital and requires major changes in everyday life for European households, including new prosumer roles linking renewable energy production and household consumption by use of smart technologies. This implies major alterations in the materiality as well as the social organisation of everyday life. To guide this low-carbon transition, new theory development on the role of technological systems in everyday life is needed. Practice theories represent a strong approach in this; however, they have developed in opposition to understanding actors and structures as mutually interlinked. This means that major drivers, as well as consequences, for sustainable transition are being overlooked. This project will contribute with important new theory development to understand and promote a low-carbon transition as well as to ensure that this transition does not indirectly become a driver of gender and social inequality.
Three theoretical lines within theories of practice will be developed:
1. The importance of gender and social structures when studying household practices, including how these social structures influence formation of practices and how, in turn, social structures are formed by the development of practices.
2. The role of the ethical consumer in developing new practices, including how learning processes, media discourses and institutionalised knowledge influence formation of practices.
3. The inclusion of non-humans as carriers and performers of practices, rather than seeing the material arrangements only as the context for practices, especially when dealing with automated and internet connected technologies. 

Quantitative and qualitative empirical research guided by these theoretical approaches will contribute with work on how future low-carbon living can be achieved and the theoretical developments will form an essential foundation for policy development towards a mandatory low-carbon transition.",2018-11-01,2023-10-31,2116000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1
1852,765881,HyFiSyn,Hybrid Fibre-reinforced composites: achieving Synergetic effects through microstructural design and advanced simulation tools,"The EU has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change. The transport sector is a major contributor to these emissions, but the targets for this sector cannot be met with currently available materials technology. Due to the direct link between weight and energy consumption, EU investment in advancing lightweight technologies is crucial. Therefore, fibre-reinforced composites are a key technology, but they are not yet widely used due (1) to their high price, (2) overdesign due to a lack of toughness and (3) difficulties with recycling. Addressing these challenges through fibre-hybridisation requires a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with a strong background in both modelling and experimentation. Since such combined expertise is scarce, HyFiSyn aims to train 13 early stage researchers to become interdisciplinary, multi-talented experts. The 8 universities, 5 industrial partners and 2 professional training organisations offer the researchers a unique opportunity to be trained by world-leading experts in cutting-edge technologies, where they are supported by a strong network and industry participation. The training programme strongly emphasises entrepreneurship and innovation skills to maximise the impact of the project, thereby increasing the EUâ€™s innovation capacity. Simultaneously, the researchers will be trained through research by developing and experimentally validating advanced simulation tools to predict optimal microstructures for fibre-hybrid composites. These microstructures will then be manufactured and verified in industrial applications. To further increase its impact, HyFiSyn also designs hybrids with smart and functional properties, and will investigate strategies for more efficient usage of recycled fibres through fibre-hybridisation. The overall goal is to fundamentally understand synergetic effects, so that they can be maximally exploited and unprecedented composite performance can be achieved.",2018-06-01,2022-05-31,3371703.12,,['recycling'],1,1

Our action will disassemble and re-engineer these plant-based polymers into functional materials that will respond to the demands of the bioeconomy of the future, critically important to Europe and the world. My ambitious, high gain research plan is underpinned in the use of multiphase systems with ultra-low interfacial tension to facilitate nanocellulose liberation and atomization of lignin solution streams into spherical particles. 

BioELCell will design novel routes to control MNC and MNL reassembly in new 1-D, 2-D and 3-D structures. The systematic methodologies that I propose will address the main challenges for lignocellulose processing and deployment, considering the important effects of interactions with water. This BioELCell action presents a transformative approach by integrating complementary disciplines that will lead to a far-reaching understanding of lignocellulosic biopolymers and solve key challenges in their use, paving the way to functional product development. Results of this project permeates directly or indirectly in the grand challenges for engineering, namely, water use, carbon sequestration, nitrogen cycle, food and advanced materials. Indeed, after addressing the key fundamental elements of the research lines, BioELCell vindicates such effects based on rational use of plant-based materials as a sustainable resource, making possible the generation of new functions and advanced materials.

If coupled with innovative services offered by car manufacturers in a network of well coordinated partners supporting extensive and efficient End-Of-Life operations, the advent of E&HEVs could revolution the current mobility consumption uses of people and preserve the environmental much more than the only substitution of traditional cars with E&HEVs could do. In particular, non-ownership based models of E&HEVs with additional added-value services (leasing or renting contracts with periodic upgrade through remanufacturing, pay per use, etc.), would give OEMs the possibility to establish long-term customers relationships on one hand, and of setting-up innovative supply chains that performs systematic remanufacturing and reuse of E&HEVs parts in order to maximize the residual value of components and materials on the other. Remanufacturing, reuse and recycling would become the strategies upon which car manufacturers would base future competitiveness, leveraging on the benefits of costs saving and, at the same time, guaranteeing environmental benefits and superior performances to customers. 
However, there are substantial barriers to implement these new business models. The main one is developing adequate capabilities to remanufacture and reuse E&HEVsâ€™ components and materials in order to provide customers with added value. This is significantly difficult especially from the technological point of view, since E&HEVs determine  a fundamental transformation in vehicles design, featuring a substantial evolution in the critical components and materials.

1855,796840,PathAutoBIO,Uncovering the pathway of DNA-induced autophagy and its biological functions in viral central nervous system infection,"Pathogens establish a range of strategies to efficiently infect and persist in their hosts. These mechanisms are as varied as pathogens themselves, which poses many difficulties for fighting infections. A deep understanding of host defense mechanisms is thus crucial for developing innovative therapies. Sensing of pathogen-derived nucleic acids is pivotal for induction of host defense. The adaptor molecule STING plays a central role in this defense and coordinate activation of immune responses. Recent studies showed that cytosolic DNA sensing and subsequent STING activation also leads to induction of autophagy, a degradative pathway involved in metabolic recycling and regulation of infections and immunity. Both STING and autophagy are involved in a range of diseases e.g. infectious and autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration and cancers. However, the links between STING and autophagy and their regulation of the balance between protective responses and harmful inflammation is elusive. Likewise, the roles of STING-mediated autophagy during viral infections is unknown. Using cutting-edge tools e.g. ImageStream X flow cytometry and genome-editing of human stem cells-derived brain cells using CRISPR/Cas9, PathAutoBIO will decipher the pathway of this novel STING function. We will then combine in vitro and in vivo models of central nervous system viral infection to explore STING-mediated autophagy functions at this unique site, where autophagy and STING are important for viral clearance. We will build upon the expertise of the host lab in DNA sensing, take advantage of unique tools developed for the project, and integrate leading international collaborators. Combined with my strong background in infection cell biology, our work will provide insights on the cross-regulations between autophagy and immunity.

1857,797188,TreEsilience,Global patterns of intraspecific variation in tree resilience to drought,"Forests provide essential long-term ecosystem services, such as reducing carbon emission and biodiversity conservation, and consequently, are the focus of many conservation policies (i.e. Europe 2020 Strategy). Drought events associated with climate change reduce tree growth and prompt mortality episodes, impacting global and severely forest ecosystems. The ability of trees to resist and recover from drought (tree resilience) will be decisive to maintain the functioning of forest ecosystems. Measuring tree climate-growth relationship and resilience is thus key for predicting the effect of climate change. However, because different tree populations may have faced contrasting climatic conditions, the within-species response to climate change may differ geographically due to local adaptation. TreEsilience proposes using tree rings to investigate the role of local adaptation in determining intraspecific variation in tree resilience to drought. To date, such an intraspecific approach has never been pursued. In order to reach this ambitious goal, TreEsilience will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines dendrochronology, phylogenetic comparative methods and species distribution modelling, thus bringing tools from the spatial and evolutionary ecology to the study of forest management and conservation. The results will provide insights into novel strategies to improve forestry efficiency by identifying early signals of tree mortality, useful for forest practitioners, policy-makers and stakeholders in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of land degradation and desertification on human wellbeing due to climate change.",2018-05-01,2020-10-19,170121.6,,['forest management'],1,1

1. Simulate the multi energy systems in the case studies and optimise their operation strategies maximising the provision of specific flexibility services
2. From existing regulations, propose improved market designs, and integrate them in a market simulation platform for evaluating its performance among the case study countries
3. Quantify the benefit of pooling flexibilities from decentralized multi energy systems for energy markets through an aggregation platform.
MAGNITUDE results will  define policy strategies and recommendations in a pan-European perspective. Achievements will be spread among stakeholders to raise awareness and foster higher collaboration among the electricity, heating and gas sectors to achieve the common goal of a less carbon intensive, yet reliable energy system.",2017-10-01,2021-03-31,3999057.5,,['renewable energy'],1,1

We aim to better understand porous rocks physics in the context of elasto-acoustic wave propagation phenomena. We will develop parallel high-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA) simulators for geophysics. We will design and implement fast and robust parallel solvers for linear equations to model multi-physics electromagnetic and elasto-acoustic phenomena. We seek to develop a parallel joint inversion workflow for electromagnetic and seismic geophysical measurements. To verify and validate these tools and methods, we will apply the results to: characterise hydrocarbon reservoirs, determine optimal locations for geothermal energy production, analyze earthquake propagation, and jointly invert deep-azimuthal resistivity and elasto-acoustic borehole measurements. 
Our target computer architectures for the  simulation and inversion software infrastructure consists of distributed-memory parallel machines that incorporate the latest Intel Xeon Phi processors. Thus, we will build a hybrid OpenMP and MPI software framework.
We will widely disseminate our collaborative research results through publications, workshops, postgraduate courses to train new researchers, a dedicated webpage with regular updates, and visits to companies working in the area. Therefore, we will perform a significant role in technology transfer between the most advanced numerical methods and mathematics, the latest super-computer architectures, and the area of applied geophysics.",2018-04-01,2022-03-31,765000.0,,['geothermal energy'],1,1

The aim of iModBatt is to design and manufacture, with minimum environmental impact, a high energy density modular battery pack flexible enough to be used in automotive and small stationary applications. This battery pack will be suitable for industrial automated assembly with an easy disassembly design, to make possible the shift from primary applications to secondary ones, and to facilitate the pack recyclability or parts replacement if necessary. 
The project concept is built around an already existing technologically breakthrough, modular battery pack design primarily developed for specialty applications, that has proven excellent performance and cost efficiency in such a manner that higher ambition, wider spread electric vehicle applications seem the natural next developmental step for such a concept.
The project focuses into maximization of the energy density of a lithium ion pack through the optimization of the structural design and components of a battery pack for a given cell form factor. In this sense the strategy is to increase the energy density by reducing the weight of the battery pack while keeping structural integrity and easy assembly and manufacturing. Chemistry and BMS work is beyond the scope of the project, which focuses in the structural design and manufacturing.
The Consortium includes industrial partners of every step of the battery pack value chain, including  automotive OEMs, battery parts manufacturers as well as leading European research centres with ample experience in the field of batteries.",2017-10-01,2020-09-30,5180794.01,,['electric vehicle'],1,1

As a most relevant example, the processâ€”known as dopingâ€”of introducing foreign impurities in suitable hosts has led, among others, to the development of Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs), materials combining visible-light optical transparency with high electrical conductivity that are nowadays an irreplaceable component of solar cells and touch screens. Plasmonics and photonics, in parallel, have reached unprecedented levels of control of electromagnetic energy thanks to the possibility of fabricating and tailoring metallic nanostructures with physical dimensions down to the micro- and nano-scale for nano-antennas, perfect absorber and cloaking applications, to mention a few. One of the new challenges that researchers and engineers are facing is merging optical and electrical control in a single device for developing next-generation photovoltaic, opto-electronic devices and energy-efficient solid-state lighting.
PLaTONE proposes the realization of a novel class of materials combining plasmonic resonators with TCO-based thin-film capacitors, a system envisaged in literature but not yet achieved. PLaTONE will address the fabrication and the electrical/optical characterization of these systems and exploit the mutual interaction between the plasmonic nanostructures and the voltage-controlled dielectric properties of the TCO for achieving an active optoelectronic device. PLaTONE musters up a team of highly experienced researchers from both academic and non-academic institutions to tackle the issue, and provides the candidate the ideal environment for boosting his skills and assemble a solid collaboration network for future national and international funding programs.",2018-10-01,2020-09-30,168277.2,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

Since the turn of the millennium, fatalities due to earthquakes were over 60,000/year, with a $300 billion/year estimated direct economic loss. Recent major earthquakes (China 2008, Haiti 2010, Lorca 2011, Japan 2012, Nepal 2015) have highlighted yet again the vulnerability of the existing substandard building stock in Europe as well as in developing countries, mainly due to inappropriate design and poor construction practices. Although new technologies, such as Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP), are effective for strengthening substandard structures, their high material cost is an obstacle for their widespread application, especially in developing countries. This project aims to develop an innovative and economic strengthening solution by using a novel mortar-based composite (R-SRG), which comprises of recycled high strength steel cords, by-product of tyre recycling, embedded in an inorganic grout matrix. This novel technique can be efficiently used for flexural, axial and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) members and it is cost effective (more than 40% cheaper than using FRP), fire resistant, sustainable, and has low environmental impact. While proof of concept studies by the applicant have demonstrated the efficiency of the SRG technique, this project bridges the knowledge gap by developing fundamental understanding, design-oriented models and performance-based design guidelines so that this new technique can be introduced in practice. The outcomes of this project will lead to a new generation of low-cost and efficient retrofitting systems for deteriorated or seismically deficient structures with high impact on both economy and society.",2016-09-01,2018-08-31,195454.8,,['recycling'],1,1
1865,682602,BIGSEA,Biogeochemical and ecosystem interactions with socio-economic activity in the global ocean,"The global marine ecosystem is being deeply altered by human activity. On the one hand, rising concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases are changing the physical and chemical state of the ocean, exerting pressure from the bottom up. Meanwhile, the global fishery has provided large economic benefits, but in so doing has restructured ecosystems by removing most of the large animal biomass, a major top-down change. Although there has been a tremendous amount of research into isolated aspects of these impacts, the development of a holistic understanding of the full interactions between physics, chemistry, ecology and economic activity might appear impossible, given the myriad complexities. This proposal lays out a strategy to assemble a team of trans-disciplinary expertise, that will develop a unified, data-constrained, grid-based modeling framework to represent the most important interactions of the global human-ocean system. Building this framework requires solving a series of fundamental problems that currently hinder the development of the full model. If these problems can be solved, the resulting model will reveal novel emergent properties and open the doors to a range of previously unexplored questions of high impact across a range of disciplines. Key questions include the ways in which animals interact with oxygen minimum zones with implications for fisheries, the impacts fish harvesting may have on nutrient recycling, spatio-temporal interactions between managed and unmanaged fisheries, and fundamental questions about the relationships between fish price, fishing cost, and multiple markets in a changing world. Just as the first coupled ocean-atmosphere models revealed a wealth of new behaviours, the coupled human-ocean model proposed here has the potential to launch multiple new fields of enquiry. It is hoped that the novel approach will contribute to a paradigm shift that treats human activity as one component within the framework of the Earth System.",2016-07-01,2021-06-30,1600000.0,,['recycling'],1,1

However, most reports thus far use transition metal complexes based on rare and expensive iridium and ruthenium. In this Marie Curie proposal, metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) will be applied as abundant and cheap visible light photocatalysts to establish C-C and C-N linkages in organic molecules in batch and photomicroflow reactors. To extend their absorption to the visible light range, I will study the formation of so-called ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) complexes with different adsorbates/ligands covalently linked to the surface of the MOS. The effect of linkers, ligands, different organic solvents, concentrations, as well as reaction times will be studied in the formation of these complexes. The LMCT complexes will be fully characterized with spectroscopic techniques. Next, these new photocatalysts will be evaluated in valuable C-C and C-N forming organic reactions. Furthermore, mechanistic studies will be carried out to aid the discovery process and to further optimize the photocatalysts. Finally, the reactions will be carried out in continuous-flow reactors to increase the efficiency of the photocatalytic transformation. Hereto, a slurry Taylor flow regime will be used and a recycling strategy will be developed to efficiently reuse the photocatalyst. We will also use so-called Luminescent Solar Concentrator PhotoMicroreactors (LSC-PM) to enable the use of solar energy.

1867,771005,CoCoSym,Symmetry in Computational Complexity,"The last 20 years of rapid development in the computational-theoretic aspects of the fixed-language Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) has been fueled by a connection between the complexity and a certain concept capturing symmetry of computational problems in this class.


My vision is that this connection will eventually evolve into the organizing principle of computational complexity and will lead to solutions of fundamental problems such as the Unique Games Conjecture or even the P-versus-NP problem.  In order to break through the current limits of this algebraic approach, I will concentrate on specific goals designed to

(A) discover suitable objects capturing symmetry that reflect the complexity in problem classes, where such an object is not known yet;

(B) make the natural ordering of symmetries coarser so that it reflects the complexity more faithfully;

(C) delineate the borderline between computationally hard and easy problems;

(D) strengthen characterizations of existing borderlines to increase their usefulness as tools for proving hardness and designing efficient algorithm; and

(E) design efficient algorithms based on direct and indirect uses of symmetries.

The specific goals concern the fixed-language CSP over finite relational structures and its generalizations to infinite domains (iCSP) and weighted relations (vCSP), in which the algebraic theory is highly developed and the limitations are clearly visible. 

The approach is based on joining the forces of the universal algebraic methods in finite domains, model-theoretical and topological methods in the iCSP, and analytical and probabilistic methods in the vCSP.

1868,770887,PICOMETRICS,Picometer metrology for light-element nanostructures: making every electron count,"Understanding nanostructures down to the atomic level is the key to optimise the design of advanced materials with revolutionary novel properties. This requires characterisation methods enabling one to quantify atomic structures with high precision.

The strong interaction of accelerated electrons with matter makes that transmission electron microscopy is one of the most powerful techniques for this purpose. However, beam damage, induced by the high energy electrons, strongly hampers a detailed interpretation. To overcome this problem, I will usher electron microscopy in a new era of non-destructive picometer metrology. This is an extremely challenging goal in modern technology because of the increasing complexity of nanostructures and the role of light elements such as lithium or hydrogen. Non-destructive picometer metrology will allow us to answer the question: what is the position, composition and bonding of every single atom in a nanomaterial even for light elements?

There has been significant progress with electron microscopy to study beam-hard materials. Yet, major problems exist for radiation-sensitive nanostructures because of the lack of physics-based models, detailed statistical analyses, and optimal design of experiments in a self-consistent computational framework. In this project, novel data-driven methods will be combined with the latest experimental capabilities to locate and identify atoms, to detect light elements, to determine the three-dimensional ordering, and to measure the oxidation state from single low-dose recordings. The required electron dose is envisaged to be four orders of magnitude lower than what is nowadays used. In this manner, beam damage will be drastically reduced or even be ruled out completely.

The results of my programme will enable precise characterisation of nanostructures in their native state; a prerequisite for understanding their properties. Clearly this is important for the design of a broad range of nanomaterials.",2018-05-01,2023-04-30,1998750.0,,['nanomaterial'],1,1

We propose to combine the element sensitivity of X-ray spectroscopy with attosecond temporal resolution and ultrathin liquid microjets to study electronic dynamics of relevance to chemical, biological and photovoltaic processes. We will build on our recent achievements in demonstrating femtosecond time-resolved measurements in the water, attosecond pho-toelectron spectroscopy on a liquid microjet and measuring and controlling attosecond charge migration in isolated molecules. We will first concentrate on liquid water to study its electronic dynamics following outer-valence ionization, the formation pathway of the solvated electron and the time scales and intermolecular Coulombic decay following inner-valence or core-level ionization. Second, we will turn to solvated species and measure electronic dynamics and charge migration in solvated molecules, transition-metal complexes and pho-toexcited nanoparticles. These goals will be achieved by developing several innovative experimental tech-niques. We will develop a source of isolated attosecond pulses covering the water window (285-538 eV) and combine it with a flat liquid microjet to realize attosecond transient absorption in liquids. We will complement these measurements with attosecond X-ray emission spectroscopy, Auger spectroscopy and a novel hetero-dyne-detected variant of resonant inelastic Raman scattering, exploiting the large bandwidth that is naturally available from attosecond X-ray sources.",2018-04-01,2023-03-31,2750000.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1

The amount of carbon sequestered, and therefore the net long-term global cooling potential of coastal marshes, however, is affected by complex biogeochemical reactions in marsh soils, which may produce and/or consume all three of the major greenhouse gases (GHGs) (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)). The magnitude and direction of these fluxes, and whether marsh soils act as a source or sink of GHGs, is affected by a variety of environmental factors which are predicted to vary with projected global change. MarshFlux, therefore, aims to address fundamental gaps in understanding of how the global cooling potential of coastal marshes will be affected by responses of biogeochemical reaction rates and GHG fluxes to global change. The effect of multiple drivers of global change on the response of GHG fluxes and key microbial processes for the consumption and production of N2O and CH4, will be investigated using a novel combination of laboratory incubations and mesocosm experiments. Laboratory incubation experiments mimicking modelled global change scenarios will be conducted to constrain the effects of drivers on marsh soil biogeochemical reaction rates and subsequent GHG dynamics, focusing on temperature, nutrient-loading and salinity. The results of these experiments, while critical themselves, will then inform mesocosm experiments to allow for the assessment of the whole ecosystem (soil, water and vegetation) response to global change under current and predicted future conditions.

Heating crops roots is essential to obtain higher yields, but existing technologies fail to direct the energy to the crops, heating the whole greenhouse instead. This has a large cost in terms of energy consumption (up to 40% energy waste) and GHG emissions and promotes pest infestation. With AgrowFab, we aim to commercialize a cost-efficient and sustainable technology consisting on a smart fabric that radiates heat as Far Infrared radiation (FIR). The fabric is made from nylon fibres coated with a proprietary non-metal carbon compound, making them electrically conductive. Our productâ€™s nature (lightweight and mechanically flexible) allows its application to surface of any kind/size, and, thanks to a powerful control algorithm, it can be combined with other smart management systems to simultaneously control heating, irrigation and fertilization cycles, therefore enabling the complete management of the root-zone environment. AgrowFab controls the rootâ€™s capacity to absorb oxygen, water and nutrients on-demand, enhancing crop yields by 35%, while minimizing the energy waste (at least 40% lower) through accurate and faster (35-45%) temperature delivery.

It is the joint effort of renowned institutional, technical and social expertise led by the City of Vienna, to create an attractive offer - One-Stop-Shop - for the Viennese private home owners and their building managers built on existing services.

The project is designed as comprehensive participatory process, involving the key stakeholders in Vienna and thus laying the ground for stable local partnerships for renovation. Substantial support has already been achieved in preparation of the proposal. The project combines new consulting services, banking and finance instruments, targeted subsidies, communication formats as well as technical and legal framework conditions into integrated services. Careful market segmentation and target-group specific communication will support the development and thorough testing of a number of new packages â€“ including topics like efficient technologies, renewable energy and energy poverty. Quality assurance to support home owners in achieving the expected energy savings will be the essential element.

1879,865082,SenseGuard,SenseGuard â€“ A breakthrough respiratory monitoring device incorporating novel nanotechnology-based sensors,"Respiratory rate is a vital sign used to monitor the progression of illness both in hospitals and at home, particularly when dealing with at-risk patients. The continuous monitoring is key for patients with respiratory conditions (i.e. asthma), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) or pneumonia, with cardiovascular conditions, as well as elderly with comorbidities and prematurely born babies or babies with respiratory conditions.

SenseGuard  respiratory monitoring device - is a decision support tool that assists practitioners in better monitoring patients with respiratory conditions like and at risks of deterioration. SenseGuard enables effective generation of alerts to clinical personnel, at the earliest moment following a change in patientâ€™s status, at the hospital or at home. Due to its direct and high-resolution respiratory sensors, SenseGuard is able to continuously monitor pulmonary function on a breath-to-breath basis, unmatched by other technologies. SenseGuardTM can effectively monitor all at-risk patients.

NanoVation is an Israeli SME, founded in 2014, which develops and integrates nanomaterial-based sensors for medical applications and general purposes. Run by an experienced and multi-disciplinary team, NanoVation was granted several EU and non-EU projects, one of which awarded the 2018 Innovation Award by the European Commission. So far, NanoVation has raised and invested more than â‚¬ 2.5M into the development of SenseGuard. To have it fully projected at a European and global level, NanoVation needs a further investment of â‚¬2.2M to complete product development and set up a solid EU value chain.

Thus, improvements are needed to provide cost effective solutions with high bio-based contents and suitable performances for demanding packaging applications, with a consumption of 19M ton/year, while still achieving compostability in mild conditions.
Using sustainably sourced comonomers, additives and fillers to formulate novel PLA copolymers and compounds, the BIOnTOP project will deliver recyclable-by-design cost competitive packaging solutions that can be mechanically recycled, industrially/home composted or even suitable for anaerobic digestion. 
Moreover, the barrier properties of delivered bio-packaging trays, films and derived packaging, will be enhanced using removable protein-based coatings and a novel fatty acid grafting technology to decrease permeability and compete with fossil packaging. 
In the field of textile packaging , most used coatings are not bio-based and of different nature from the coated fibres, making material or organic recycling extremely difficult. New PLA coatings or fatty grafting will allow reprocessing without significant loss of properties.
BIOnTOP packaging, based on >85% renewable resources, will be compatible with a broad range of packaging applicationsâ€™ requirements but also multiple end of Life options. Our materials will be biodegradable in home composting conditions but also recyclable for multiple use secondary packaging.
Based on new circular bioeconomy value chains, BIOnTOP will generate growth for EU bioplastics and end usersâ€™ industries in the food and personal care sectors with potential in many fields: BIOnTOP production is estimated to reach close to 9.6 Mton per year by 2030, overall leading to â‚¬40 M turnover and 170 new jobs.

In this respect LAB&FAB aims at developing the fabrication of efficient, cheap and stable organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology printed on flexible substrates, which will be scalable and eventually transferred from a lab-environment to production line. 
LAB&FAB action will spread on the two parallel fronts: the pilot-scale on one side, and the lab-scale on the other. At the pilot-scale, LAB&FAB will exploit state-of-the art printed OPV modules to push their efficiency, while doubling their lifetime by the end of the project. Long-term stability tests will be carried out and allow for a complete durability assessment, while technological improvements will be introduced to target the efficiency/lifetime goals, as specific weaknesses will be spotted. At the lab scale, novel and efficient materials will be thoroughly explored and characterised and optimised printing protocols will be established for their subsequent integration into solar cells large-area production. Degradation tests will also help assess the materials/devices performance, and at the end of fellowship new efficiency/lifetime benchmarks for such scaled OPV cells will be set.
The Experienced Researcher (ER) acquired a solid background on physics of OPV, and thanks to this fellowship she will capitalise and expand it toward more technologically-based challenges related to its technology upscaling. The Host Institution ENI (Italy) is embracing a full transition toward a low-carbon scenario, and thanks to the multidisciplinary aspects of LAB&FAB (covering physics, device engineering, and intellectual property management just to name a few) the Host will be able to offer the ER the perfect environment for future growth and advancement of her professional career in the non-academic sector.",2020-09-01,2022-08-31,171473.28,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1882,840836,BiMetaCat,Two Are Better Than One: Bimetallic Catalysts for the Conversion of  Lignin-Derived Aryl-Ethers,"Aromatic building blocks are essential for the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and plastics but are mainly produced from finite fossil resources. Lignin, a complex biopolymer that is rich in aromatic rings, can serve as a renewable source for aromatic base chemicals. Significant advances towards the depolymerization of lignin now give access to a plethora of small aromatic compounds with a variety of valuable functional groups. However, current catalyst systems are unable to convert these compounds into aromatic building blocks without loss of these desirable functional groups. Hence, there is a need for the development of new catalysts that are capable of handling these oxygen-rich materials that are derived from biomass.

The objective of the proposed research is to develop novel bimetallic base metal catalysts for the conversion of lignin-derived compounds into aromatic building blocks. These bimetallic catalysts will be designed to specifically target the robust aromatic C-O ether bonds that are present in lignin-derived compounds. I will synthesize new ligand frameworks that can host two low-valent base metals, which strongly bind and activate aromatics. In contrast to conventional homogeneous catalysts, the envisioned catalysts will have active sites in close proximity to each other, enabling cooperative making and breaking of chemical bonds by multiple metal centers. The tunable nature of these ligands will enable obtaining detailed understanding on how to facilitate the bottleneck oxidative addition of aryl-ethers. 

The development of new catalytic methodologies that allow valorization of highly oxygenated biomass-derived compounds is essential to decrease our dependence on fossil resources. This research will fundamentally advance understanding of how multiple metals can activate strong chemical bonds, which will be employed to develop catalysts that use lignin-derived compounds for the synthesis of valuable aromatic building blocks.",2019-04-01,2021-03-31,187572.48,,['biopolymer'],1,1
1883,832552,BACTEPEA,Unraveling the molecular dialogue in microbial-assisted plant growth in the presence of heavy metals,"Agriculture is currently confronting (i) an increasing human population and (ii) limitations of soil use due to, among other reasons, pollution levels above food safety threshold values. Some agricultural practices increase the heavy metal content (HM) of agricultural soil, representing an important threat for the European agricultural development. The use of microorganisms as plant growth promoters has been increasingly studied for a number of years, but it has only recently been proposed to improve plant metal tolerance. Regrettably, plant-microorganism-pollutant interactions are still poorly understood and the molecular underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown. The abovementioned challenges for agricultural production require the study of these mechanisms to better promote a more efficient and sustainable agriculture. This project will venture into new unchartered territory by focusing on the molecular interactions between a probiotic actinobacterium (Micromonospora cremea) and its host, Pisum sativum (garden pea), in the presence of HMs. We will evaluate the capacity of M. cremea CR30 to improve plant tolerance to HM polluted soils, in addition to unraveling the molecular dialogue during the first and late steps of their interaction. Early step interactions are crucial in plant promotion and protection against external stresses, like pollution by HM. Here, we propose the use of new -omic technologies to study these molecular interactions between plants and microorganisms under metal stress, providing a new pathway for an improved soil management. This project addresses a crucial objective in food security, the development of sustainable agricultural practices to control potentially adverse HM effects on plant health.",2020-05-01,2022-04-30,172932.48,,['soil management'],1,1
1884,834142,ScalableControl,Scalable Control of Interconnected Systems,"Modern society is critically dependent on large-scale networks for services such as energy supply, transportation and communications. The design and control of such networks is becoming increasingly complex, due to their growing size, heterogeneity and autonomy. A systematic theory and methodology for control of large-scale interconnected systems is therefore needed. In an ambitious effort towards this goal, this project will develop rigorous tools for control synthesis, adaptation and verification. 

Many large-scale systems exhibit properties that have not yet been systematically exploited by the control community. One such property is positive (or monotone) system dynamics. This correspond to the property that all states of a network respond in the same direction when the demand or supply is perturbed in some node. Scalable methods for control of positive systems are starting to be developed, but several fundamental questions remain: How can existing results be extended to scalable synthesis of dynamic controllers? Can results for linear positive systems be extended to nonlinear monotone ones? How about systems with resonances? 

The second focus area, adaptation, takes advantage of recent progress in machine learning, such as statistical concentration bounds and approximate dynamic programming. Adaptation is of fundamental importance for scalability, since high-fidelity models are very expensive to generate manually and hard to maintain. Thirdly, since systematic procedures for control synthesis generally rely on simplified models and idealized assumptions, we will also develop scalable methods to bound the effect of imperfections, such as nonlinearities, time-variations and parameter uncertainty that are not taken into account in the original design. 

The research will be carried out in interaction with industry studying a new concept for district heating networks. This collaboration will give access to experimental data from a full scale demonstration plant.",2019-09-01,2024-08-31,2500000.0,,['district heating'],1,1

Repurposing of AZD0530 (saracatinib, AstraZeneca) would be an ideal solution for de-risking early clinical studies. Using existing assets and investments, this may allow more affordable pricing once an indication is approved. Ectopic bone is formed in soft tissues due to activating mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor kinase ALK2/ACVR1, leading to progressive contractures and early death. Preclinical studies showed AZD0530, previously unexplored in FOP, to be a potent (5nM) inhibitor of ALK2 kinase and ALK2-R206H-mediated neofunction after activin stimulation. In mice, AZD0530 blocked ectopic bone formation preserving limb movement.

Hypothesis: AZD0530 will reduce ectopic bone formation and progressive disability in people with FOP.

AIM: to provide proof of concept that AZD0530 is an effective drug in the treatment of patients with FOP.

Methods: Based on the rarity of the disease and expected drug efficacy (50% reduction in new bone), a phase 2A proof of concept study including a 6 month randomized placebo controlled study and 12 month open label extension study using historical data, is proposed including 16 adults with active FOP disease. The study will be performed in three European FOP expert Centers (Amsterdam The Netherlands â€“ Lead, London UK, and Garmen Partenkirchen Germany). The study will be performed in collaboration with the expert preclinical teams at the Universities of Oxford and Harvard.

Anaerobic digesters treat high COD wastewater and produce biogas used as a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, even the most advanced high-rate systems present important technical and economic limitations: 1) Post-treatment (usually aerobic) is still required for wastewater discharge on surface water (COD elimination rates are in the range of 60-80% for current technologies), 2) Digester investment costs are high (â‚¬300,000 for the smallest reactors), 3) The efficiency of biogas production is low (35-50%). The above confirms that the industry is on demand of low price digesters and high efficiency biogas production solutions that will increase COD elimination rates. 
Through the launch of ANAERGY, Ingeobras and Proycon consortium aim to respond to these demands by introducing a proprietary Multiphase Sequential Anaerobic Digester, being the first demonstrated solution able to combine anaerobic, aerobic and photocatalysis in one digester. Our current prototype was built in-house and has been tested under relevant industrial conditions in 4 pilot plants, offering very high COD elimination rates (up to 99.8%) allowing for direct discharge to the land and a 60% increase in biogas production efficiency. At a low price (â‚¬150,000) and with very low operational cost we are offering a extremely efficient solution for the agro-food industry to treat water without need of post-treatment (60% reduction in operational costs). Furthermore, the production of biogas will cover industry energy needs up to 80%, enabling a return of investment of 12-20 months.

- Wood waste is converted to biocoal by torrefaction
- Biocoal replaces fossil powdered coal in a steel mill blast furnace
- Carbon monoxide in blast furnace exhaust fumes is microbially fermented to bioethanol
- Material and energy loops of the process are closed to a very large degree
Every steel mill that implements this concept will be able to produce at least 80 million litres of bioethanol per year. This project creates a value chain for wood waste, which currently has no attractive applications. The technology concept is open ended: in the future, stakeholders may replicate the concept with other feedstocks and for producing other types of fuels.
The business case the Torero project will produce a competitive process for non-food feedstock bioethanol production. Compared with the current first generation production based cellulosic bio-ethanol solution the Torero innovation the OPEX of Torero is 1/3 lower with a same CAPEX. This will allow scale up of torrefaction technology when successfully demonstrated.
Most importantly, together with sister project Steelanol, Torero will be the only H2020 project to demonstrate a biofuel production process that is integrated in an existing, fully functional large-scale industrial facility. All other H2020 solutions will need to be newly built if they ever reach full industrial scale.

The demand for more sustainable and renewable monomers and polymers is currently increasing, because fossil feedstock will become scarce in future times, and the global legislation is putting an increasing stress on the use of certain monomers used in the polymer industry. The aliphatic polyesters represent one of the most appealing type of bioplastic materials, because of their general biocompatibility and facile hydrolytic degradation and, in this ambit, the use of terpenes as monomers or monomer-precursors is largely unexplored. The primary objective of this project, is the creation of new polyester formulations based on renewable and accessible terpene monomers to answer to the growing need for future generations of more functional and sustainable materials. Three renewable monomers have been selected, two derived from camphor and a new one from Î²-elemene. Structurally new polyesters will be synthesized by ring opening (co)polymerization of these monomers, using catalytic systems based on cheap and health-friendly metals (Fe, Al). The use of the new Î²-elemene based monomer will incorporate vinylic groups along the polymer chains, offering the possibility for post-modification of the obtained material. The success of the project is supported by the Experienced Researcher background in polymer synthesis with the Host experience in the discovery and catalytic valorization of new terpene scaffolds. The action will take place in an interdisciplinary and international environment, granting to the Experienced Researcher a solid train in scientific and soft skills needed for his future career.

1892,839389,OCPSTRUCTDYNAMICS,Structural dynamics essential for photosynthetic adaptation and survival of cyanobacteria in fluctuating light intensities,"Like most photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria are vulnerable to fluctuations in light intensity, which can damage their photosynthetic machinery. To protect themselves against such fluctuations, they use a photoprotective mechanism called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), i.e. the dissipation of excess absorbed photo-energy as heat. NPQ in cyanobacteria is triggered by orange carotenoid protein (OCP) light activation. Based on spectroscopic and diffraction studies of OCP in Synechocystis 6803 (gene slr1963), it was suggested that OCP light activation occurs through light-induced movement of a carotenoid causing movement and/or dissociation of OCP N- and C-terminal domains. However, the exact structural dynamics of OCP light-activation need to be unravelled. Furthermore, the growing availability of cyanobacterial genomes allowed identification of additional OCP subfamilies (OCP2, OCPX) in different cyanobacteria. The first results demonstrating different kinetics of light-activation in the different OCP paralogs raised questions about differences in their photoprotective roles and in photoactivation mechanisms. This topic has not been studied to date. Here I propose to resolve structural changes during photoprotection-related transitions of OCP in different OCP subfamilies using time-resolved X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography of OCP1 encoded by slr1963, the best-characterized OCP protein, as well as its paralogs from the OCP2 and OCPX subfamilies will be performed. This approach will be combined with ultrafast transient (polarised) absorption spectroscopy on isolated proteins and oriented single crystals to describe the structure-dependent flow of photoenergy in the proteins. This study has several potential applications ranging from enhancing cyanobacterial light harvesting to improve biofuel production, to better understanding of carotenoid-protein interactions in artificial photosynthesis systems, and for optogenetics.",2020-01-08,2022-01-07,212933.76,,['biofuel'],1,1

A central element of the work builds on recent international developments in the field of wave breaking and wave run-up led by the PI that have provided the first universal criterion for predicting the onset of breaking of water waves in uniform water depths from deep to intermediate. This work has also shown that the run-up of nonlinear waves impinging on a vertical wall can exceed up to 12 times the far-field amplitude of the incoming waves. These results have now opened up the possibility for more accurate operational wave models. They have practical and economic benefits in determining structural loads on ships and coastal/offshore infrastructure, evaluating seabed response to extreme waves, and optimizing operational strategies for maritime and marine renewable energy enterprises.  This is a tremendous advance comparable to the introduction of wave prediction during World War II, and the PI aims to be at the forefront of this research effort to take research in wave breaking into fundamentally new directions.  The objectives of the project are: (i) to develop an innovative approach to include accurate wave breaking physics into coupled sea state and ocean weather forecasting models; (ii) to obtain improved criteria for the design of ships and coastal/offshore infrastructure; (iii) to quantify erosion by powerful breaking waves, and (iv) to develop new concepts in wave measurement with improved characterization of wave breaking using real-time instrumentation.

Owing to the exceptional stability of molecular nitrogenâ€™s triple bond the Haber-Bosch process is an energy intensive chemical process which accounts for 1-2 % of the world's energy production, consumes 2-3 % of the global natural gas output and emits more than 300 million tonnes of CO2. In light of an increasing population (and fertilizer demand) coupled with an urgency to reduce CO2 emissions, efforts to find alternative technologies for NF that offer the potential of reduced energy usage while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated. Electrically powered plasma processes are considered as a promising alternative for delocalized fertilizer production, based on renewable energy, and more specifically for NO production. To-date, however, plasma designs for NF have not exceeded Haber-Bosch efficiencies. Pulsed powered microwave (MW) generated plasma technology offers some promise in this regard. Pulsing of the discharge power enables strategies which direct energy to primarily heat electrons (â€™non-thermalâ€™ conditions) providing a far more efficient pathway to molecular bond breakage (and resulting NO production) than thermal effects. Indeed, reports on pulsed powered MW discharges have indicated an opportunity to tune electron energies to maximize molecular vibrational excitation, identified as an optimal route for energy efficiency in NO production. In a novel advance, plasma efficient nitrogen fixation â€™PENFIX', proposes to interrogate â€™pulsedâ€™ powered atmospheric microwave (MW) plasma for nitric oxide (NO) production using air.

Yet, due to slow responses, many biological communities are lagging behind warming of the macroclimate (the climate of a large geographic region). The buffering of microclimates near the ground measured in localized areas, arising from terrain features such as vegetation and topography, can explain why many species are lagging behind macroclimate warming. However, almost all studies ignore the effects of microclimatic buffering and key uncertainties still exist about this mechanism. Microclimates are particularly evident in forests, where understorey habitats are buffered by overstorey trees. In temperate forests, the understorey contains the vast majority of plant diversity and plays an essential role in driving ecosystem processes.

The overall goal of FORMICA (FORest MICroclimate Assessment) is to quantify and understand the role of microclimatic buffering in modulating forest understorey plant responses to macroclimate warming. We will perform the best assessment to date of the effects of microclimates on plants by applying microtemperature loggers, experimental heating, fluorescent tubes and a large-scale transplant experiment in temperate forests across Europe. For the first time, plant data from the individual to ecosystem level will be related to microclimate along wide temperature gradients and forest management regimes. The empirical results will then be integrated in cutting-edge demographic distribution models to forecast plant diversity in temperate forests as macroclimate warms.

FORMICA will provide the first integrative study on microclimatic buffering of macroclimate warming in forests. Interdisciplinary concepts and methods will be applied, including from climatology, forestry and ecology.  FORMICA will reshape our current understanding of the impacts of climate change on forests and help land managers and policy makers to develop urgently needed adaptation strategies.",2018-02-01,2023-01-31,1498469.0,,['forest management'],1,1

These materials will include porous molecules, small organic molecules and macromolecular polymers, which have application as a result of either their porosity or optoelectronic properties. The applications that will be targeted include in molecular separations, sensing, (photo)catalysis and photovoltaics. To achieve my aims, I will screen libraries of building blocks through a combination of techniques including evolutionary algorithms and machine learning. Through the application of cheminformatics algorithms, I will target the most promising libraries, assess synthetic diversity and accessibility and analyse structure-property relationships. I will develop software that will predict the (macro)molecular structures and properties; the molecular property screening calculations will include void characterisation, binding energies, diffusion barriers, local assembly, charge transport and energy level assessment. A consideration of synthetic accessibility at every stage will be central to my approach, which will ensure the realisation of our predicted targets. I have several synthetic collaborators who can provide pathways to synthetic realisation.

dependent on these more diverse sources and a key enabling technology is membrane filtration. While membrane system

process operation. The unique idea of this Proof of Concept is to develop an electrospun nanostructured membrane which
can be integrated into water filtration technologies. The unique method of fabrication will produce an inherently antibacterial

1900,744027,BFO-Surf,Properties across dimensions: an atomistic computational study of bismuth ferrite surfaces and nanocrystals,"Bismuth ferrite (BFO) is one of the few multiferroic materials at room temperature. It is of interest for use in memory elements, spintronic and photovoltaic systems, to name but a few. In all applications, the use of BFO thin films and nanoparticles is being greatly investigated, due to their greater fatigue resistance and larger polarization at modest electric fields with respect to the bulk. However, reducing the dimensionality of BFO can lead to surprising and so far unexplained behaviour. For example, recent experiments have reported the existence of a surface â€œskinâ€ above bulk-truncated BFO, with different lattice parameters and phase transitions than the underlying bulk. This surface skin layer exhibits strikingly different properties from the bulk, since it is ferroelastically and ferroelectrically dead. It is thus of paramount importance, for practical applications of BFO, to understand how 2D structures (like thin films) and 1D structures (like nanocrystals) differ in their multiferroic behaviour from the relatively well understood bulk phase. Since surfaces are dominant in these two classes of systems, a good atomistic understanding of low-energy surfaces and their stability in the environment is needed. Thus, we propose a two-year project with the overall aim of studying the atomistic structure and the magnetic and polarization properties of BFO thin films and nanocrystals using using ab initio methods (density functional theory with ab initio thermodynamics).",2017-10-01,2020-08-01,187419.6,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1901,635770,DiViNe,Sustainable downstream processing of vaccines through incorporation of nanobiotechnologies : novel affinity ligands and biomimetic membranes,"In the vaccine industry, downstream processing is of extreme importance. Prophylactic vaccines aim at protecting healthy people, so any contaminant has to be discarded with the most drastic measures. Such Â« negative Â» approach comes at the expense of the recovery of product : yields are poor, thereby inducing a high product cost. Processes are also complex, since they rely on multiple eliminations rather than on recovery of the unique product of interest. Technically, this is mostly due to the lack of specific capture systems that would allow direct, Â« positive Â» separation of the vaccine from its environment.Vaccines know no borders. For developing countries, the pressure on costs is even more acute, and local production is a way to try to reach the 1$ per dose target. In this context, water sustainability is a major issue, as it is a most sensitive ingredient in bioproduction.
DiViNe will tackle theses cost and environmental issues with technological answers. The partners will combine two major Nano/biotechnology innovations to develop an integrated purification platform amenable to the different natures of vaccines : glycoconjugates, protein antigens and enveloped viruses. They will implement Nanofitins (novel affinity capture ligands) and Aquaporin-based membranes (energy-saving nano-biomimetics used in the cleantech industry), for a Â« positive Â» purification approach. High yields are expected (data from antibody purification with Nanofitins), at affordable cost of goods and with a sustainable approach of water recycling.
Novartis Vaccines brings to the Consortium a broad range of targets, and identical strategies can be applied for biopharmaceuticals in general. The development custom affinity capture processes as a sustainable platform is therefore economically relevant, in a very large market.

Plant cell walls are a centrepiece of plant development and tuning their biosynthesis could improve the productivity and the quality of wheat grain. Although the structure of cell wall polysaccharides is relatively well-documented, little is known about their biosynthesis. The project proposes for the first time 1) to explore the structure, organisation and function of mannan, a cell wall polysaccharide that impacts on wheat grain development, and 2) to investigate the function of four putative genes involved in the mannan biosynthesis, using a combination of well established and new methodologies (enzymatic fingerprinting, FT-IR microspectroscopy and MALDI-MS imaging). This research is of potential interest to various industrial sectors (e.g., plant breeding, milling and biofuel industries) active in Europe and represents a good opportunity to improve competitiveness of European agriculture.

1904,793662,NERUDA,Numerical and ERT stUdies for Diffusive and Advective high-enthalpy systems,"The full development of geothermal energy is still hindered by the little knowledge available on the distribution of high-enthalpy fluids at depth and by the often-complex logistics. High-enthalpy hydrothermal systems preferentially develop in tectonically active and volcanic settings. In such environments, faults have a major control on fluid flow and may affects the overall fluid distribution at depth. However, due to the lack of in situ data, predicting the role of faults on fluid flow is challenging and often requires complementary methods. NERUDA proposes an innovative and multidisciplinary approach, combining numerical simulations of fluid flow with deep Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT). The project aims at constraining the tectonic control on fluid flow in hydrothermal systems. High-enthalpy environments often have a multi-layered structure with deep reservoirs (>300 m). Classical cable-structured ERT methods cannot reach such depths. To tackle this challenge, NERUDA will use a leading-edge technology in the field of ERT methods. The newly developed IRIS Fullwaver system allows the acquisition of deep (up to ~1 km) 3D ERT surveys. This wireless system can be deployed in areas with sharp topography (e.g. volcanoes) where classical ERT is logistically not possible. Numerical simulations of fluid flow, calibrated on the interpreted ERT surveys, will be performed to assess the fault control on fluid flow. The currently available flow simulators are either not user-friendly or lack some functionalities to adequately study high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems. NERUDA will develop an open-source, user-friendly MATLAB hydrothermal module calibrated on deep ERT to investigate high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems. This module will be implemented in the world-widely used, open-source MRST (MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox). NERUDA is expected to have a strong impact on the scientific community by widening the accessibility to user-friendly numerical tools.",2018-11-01,2020-10-31,175419.6,,['geothermal energy'],1,1

Based on prior research, supported by (joint) EU and national projects, and practical experience the bottlenecks where identified that prevent at this moment a real breakthrough of geothermal heat pumps (GEO-HP) combined with thermally activated building systems (TABS) - GEOTABS. Solutions, which need to be implemented in an integrated way, were identified and sufficient proof of concept was gathered to join forces in a RIA.
The innovative concepts aim at increasing the share of low valued (low-grade) energy sources by means of using low exergy systems on the one hand and aim at upgrading low/moderate temperature resources on the other hand.
The overall solution consists of an optimal integration of GEOTABS and secondary supply and emission systems.
To allow for an optimal use of both the GEOTABS and the secondary system, a split will be made between a so-called â€œbase loadâ€ that will be provided by the GEOTABS and the remaining energy needs that should be supplied by the secondary system. A generic rule, eliminating case-by-case simulation work, will be developed.
The second part of the proposed solution aims at a white box approach for Model Predictive Control (MPC)  to generate a controller model with precomputed model inputs such as disturbances and HVAC thermal power to avoid case by case development. Research is needed to assess the overall performance and robustness of such an approach towards uncertainties.
As such, the MPC-: GT consortium believes to have identified an integrated solution that will provide a near optimal design strategy for the MPC GEOTABS concept using optimal control integrated design.

At the same time, the railway technological infrastructure and the related services require a high level of innovation, especially in the field of telecommunication systems and rail control. In recent years, several different rail control technologies have been focused upon to increase the track capacity, improve the overall operational efficiency and ensure safer railway traffic. Among these innovative technologies applied in EU are the Communication-Based Train Control systems (CBTC) and the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
In this context, the wireless telecommunication networks are playing an increasingly important role thanks to functional and maintenance features and installation time: by virtue of their robustness and high redundancy they can convey simultaneously data traffic for automatic train control and transfer massively security and passengers control information.
However, the wireless coverage of the existing railway technological infrastructure does not ensure full operational standards, capacity and robustness required for a large-scale use in support of the railway signaling.

1910,702329,NUTS,Nuclei Using Topological Solitons,"Particle physicists have a good understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter, but the complexity of the theory means that it is impossible (even with supercomputers) to use it to predict the properties of even the simplest atoms familiar from everyday life, such as helium and carbon. Fathoming the core of these atoms is the realm of nuclear physics, but current approaches are detached from fundamental theory and instead are mainly based on fitting phenomenological models to experimental data. 
The ambitious aim of this project is to provide the missing link between fundamental theory and nuclear physics.
At the heart of the methodology for this audacious proposal is a concept known as a topological soliton -- a particle-like solution of a nonlinear wave equation, where stability is due to a topological twisting or winding. A combination of analytic and numerical work over the last twenty years has shown that topological solitons can provide a reasonable qualitative description of some aspects of nuclei, but a quantitative comparison has failed because of a long-standing problem that soliton predictions yield nuclear binding energies that are too large. However, in recent work by the researcher (Naya-Rodriguez) and collaborators, and independently by the supervisor (Sutcliffe), significant breakthroughs have been made that demonstrate the ability to reduce soliton binding energies to the correct nuclear physics levels and hence solve this long-standing problem. These new developments mean that this proposal is incredibly timely, and by uniting these two previously independent European groups there is an opportunity to make ground-breaking progress by developing these new analytical methods in combination with state-of-the-art computing capabilities.

Despite the recent progress, this emerging field is challenged by huge technical and scientific questions. In natural photosynthesis light absorption and catalysis occur in different sites of the leaf. In a simplified scenario, the energy harvested by the light absorbing pigments is funnelled towards the oxygen evolving complex. Here, we propose to realize the same biologically-inspired scheme using a novel hybrid system consisting of colloidal quantum dots embedded in a metal organic framework cage (CQD@MOF). In particular, a CQD FÃ¶rster-transfer based light harvesting antenna will directionally transfer energy to a catalyst located in separate sites of the device. In addition to the rich basic science opportunities behind the introduction of this new concept in artificial photosynthesis, full-solar spectrum harvesting deriving from the characteristic size-dependent band gap tunability of CQDs, the potential for high voltages by combining CQDs of different size and composition, and the lack of contact between the light absorber and the electrolyte, intrinsic to the proposed device architectures, are all advantages that make this CQD@MOF hybrid FÃ¶rster-based scheme highly appealing. One of the key component of the research will be to develop synthetic schemes to access these multifunctional systems with an unprecedented level of control through multiple length-scales. The experience and the skills gained by the applicant during her earlier carrier in the device fabrication together with the long-standing experience of the supervisor in this field will be extremely beneficial for a successful outcome of the proposal.NanoINCAGE is highly multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary program and its successful outcome will tremendously impact several other research fields in chemistry, materials science and engineering.",2016-09-01,2018-08-31,175419.6,,['renewable energy'],1,1

L-fucose is a rare monosaccharide with limited natural availability and a precursor of complex carbohydrates, as Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs, which are highly abundant in human milk but not in infant formula, have been recently recognised as natural molecules with high potential for nutritional and biomedical applications. Despite the increasing market demand of these â€œspecialty carbohydratesâ€, large scale production of HMOs is currently not feasible.

FucoPol â€“ as natural source of pure monosaccharides - solves the main industrial issues related to L-fucose production such as the complexity, costs and efficiency. FucoPol bio-based platform offers a sustainable solution for industrial-commercialization of HMOs, by significantly increasing L-fucose availability. Completing the innovation project objectives will result in the validation of the platform and enable the production of large amount of high-pure L-fucose to meet the quality/quantity industrial demand for this rare sugar.",2017-10-01,2019-09-30,1317195.25,,['biopolymer'],1,1
1913,679937,MagneticYSOs,Interpreting Dust Polarization Maps to Characterize the Role of the Magnetic Field in Star Formation Processes,"'Rotation and angular momentum transport play a critical role in the formation and evolution of astrophysical objects, including the fundamental bricks of astrophysical structures: stars. Stars like our Sun form when rotating dense cores, in the interstellar medium, collapse until they eventually reach temperatures at which nuclear fusion begins; while planets, including the Earth, form in the rotationally supported disks around these same young stars. One of the major challenges of modern astrophysics is the â€œangular momentum problem': observations show that a typical star-forming cloud needs to reduce its specific angular momentum by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude to form a typical star such as our Sun. It is also crucial to solve the angular momentum problem to understand the formation of protoplanetary disks, stellar binaries and the initial mass function of newly formed stars. Magnetic fields are one of the key ways of transporting angular momentum in astrophysical structures: understanding how angular momentum is transported to allow star formation requires characterizing the role of magnetic fields in shaping the dynamics of star-forming structures. The MagneticYSOs project aims at characterizing the role of magnetic field in the earliest stage of star formation, during the main accretion phase.
The simultaneous major improvements of instrumental and computational facilities provide us, for the first time, with the opportunity to confront observational information to magnetized models predictions. Polarization capabilities on the last generation of instrument in large facilities are producing sensitive observations of magnetic fields with a great level of detail, while numerical simulations of star formation are now including most of the physical ingredients for a detailed description of protostellar collapse at all the relevant scales, such as resistive MHD, radiative transfer and chemical networks. These new tools will undoubtedly lead to major discovery in the fields of planets and star formation in the coming years. It is necessary to conduct comprehensive projects able to combine theory and observations in a detailed fashion, which in turn require a collaboration with access to cutting edge observational datasets and numerical models. Through an ambitious multi-faceted program of dedicated observations probing magnetic fields (polarized dust emission and Zeeman effect maps), gas kinematics (molecular lines emission maps), ionization rates and dust properties in Class 0 protostars, and their comparison to synthetic observations of MHD simulations of protostellar collapse, we aim to transform our understanding of:
1) The long-standing problem of angular momentum in star formation
2) The origin of the stellar initial mass function
3) The formation of multiple stellar systems and circumstellar disks around young stellar objects (YSOs)
Not only this project will enable a major leap forward in our understanding of low-mass star formation, answering yet unexplored questions with innovative methods, but it will also allow to spread the expertise in interpreting high-angular resolution (sub-)mm polarization data. Although characterizing magnetic fields in astrophysical structures represents the next frontier in many fields (solar physics, evolved stars, compact objects, galactic nuclei are a few examples), only a handful of astronomers in the EU community are familiar with interferometric polarization data, mostly because of the absence of large european facilities providing such capabilities until the recent advent of ALMA. It is now crucial to strengthen the European position in this research field by training a new generation of physicists with a strong expertise on tailoring, analyzing and interpreting high angular resolution polarization data.'",2016-07-01,2021-06-30,1500000.0,,['nuclear fusion'],1,1

Lead halide organic-inorganic perovskites manifest as excellent optoelectronic materials for this purpose, but at the expense of robustness and environmental compatibility. This presents a major challenge which this research addresses directly. Viable alternatives have to be identified. To tackle this challenge, MIX2FIX proposes to develop a new class of solution-processable optoelectronic devices based on air-stable, non-toxic metal chalcogenides endowed with an organic part, which will facilitate solution-processing and potentially enrich the compounds with the spectacular properties of halide perovskites. To achieve this, the CoG project has set the following objectives: (i) designing and developing optoelectronically-active, organic-inorganic chalcogenide thin films that have never been explored before, by mimicking strategies from established perovskite technology, (ii) devising means to improve their optoelectronic quality so as to be comparable with the best single-crystal semiconductors and (iii) implementing optimized materials into boundary-pushing PV and LED devices. Addressing these objectives will enable the development of novel functional hybrids at the boundaries of perovskite and chalcogenide thin films. With this, optoelectronics with efficiency and stability, comparable or higher than those of lead halide perovskite or chalcopyrite devices, will be demonstrated. This project will therefore permit the transition for emerging optoelectronic materials from toxic lead halide perovskites to green hybrid chalcogenides. Consolidating this unproven but disruptive technology will secure sustainable future for other areas of interest beyond photovoltaics, displays and lighting such as in X-Rays detectors and phototransistors or even beyond optoelectronics, in systems such as batteries and supercapacitors.",2019-09-01,2024-08-31,2731250.0,,['PV'],1,1

1916,714551,BONEPHAGY,Defining the role of the FGF â€“ autophagy axis in bone physiology,"Autophagy is a fundamental cellular catabolic process deputed to the degradation and recycling of a variety of intracellular materials. Autophagy plays a significant role in multiple human physio-pathological processes and is now emerging as a critical regulator of skeletal development and homeostasis. We have discovered that during postnatal development in mice, the growth factor FGF18 induces autophagy in the chondrocyte cells of the growth plate to regulate the secretion of type II collagen, a major component of cartilaginous extracellular matrix. The FGF signaling pathways play crucial roles during skeletal development and maintenance and are deregulated in many skeletal disorders.  Hence our findings may offer the unique opportunity to uncover new molecular mechanisms through which FGF pathways regulate skeletal development and maintenance and to identify new targets for the treatment of FGF-related skeletal disorders. In this grant application we propose to study the role played by the different FGF ligands and receptors on autophagy regulation and to investigate the physiological relevance of these findings in the context of skeletal growth, homeostasis and maintenance. We will also investigate the intracellular machinery that links FGF signalling pathways to the regulation of autophagy. In addition, we generated preliminary data showing an impairment of autophagy in chondrocyte models of Achondroplasia (ACH) and Thanathoporic dysplasia, two skeletal disorders caused by mutations in FGFR3. We propose to study the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of FGFR3-related dwarfisms and explore the pharmacological modulation of autophagy as new therapeutic approach for achondroplasia. This application, which combines cell biology, mouse genetics and pharmacological approaches, has the potential to shed light on new mechanisms involved in organismal development and homeostasis, which could be targeted to treat bone and cartilage diseases.",2017-01-01,2021-12-31,1586430.0,,['recycling'],1,1
1917,745967,MetEmbed,Addressing metalloenzymes for clean energy production with advanced embedding schemes andquantum mechanical methods,"The proposed project aims to develop and apply quantum mechanical (QM) methods targeted at metalloenzymes, for which the methods in use today often fail. The failures are caused by inaccuracies in either 1) the underlying protein structures, 2) the employed QM method or 3) the embedding method that describes electrostatic interactions between the protein environment and the active site (i.e. metal and its nearest ligands). The MetEmbed project addresses 1), 2) and 3) with hydrogenases and polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) as target enzymes. Hydrogenases mediate the reversible conversion of dihydrogen into hydride ions and protons, while PMOs have shown great potential for biofuel production. The overall objective is to investigate the reaction and spin-state energetics for key intermediates in the two proteins' catalytic cycles. To ensure that the underlying structures are accurate, extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with tailored force fields and QM/MM methods will be employed. The adequacy of the QM methods will be ensured by using accurate, multireference QM methods that are known to be well-suited for transition metal systems. Two new multireference QM methods will be applied, namely a multiconfigurational density functional theory hybrid and the density matrix renormalization group method. These methods have high potential for metalloenzymes, but have until now only found little use in this area. To address the effect of the protein electrostatics, an accurate embedding scheme that, contrary to most QM/MM methods, includes the polarization of the environment will be used. The combination of 1) accurate structures, 2) accurate QM methods and 3) polarizable embedding schemes is unprecedented for metalloenzymes. The MetEmbed project will thus predict energetics with a new level of confidence for two systems with high potential in the areas of energy efficiency and low-carbon energy production; both central parts of the HORIZON2020 program.",2018-08-01,2020-07-31,173857.2,,['biofuel'],1,1

It has been demonstrated that optimal use of LEDs could significantly reduce the worldâ€™s electricity use for lighting from 20% to 4%. However, current LED technologies typically rely on expensive high-vacuum manufacturing processes, hampering their widespread applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-cost LEDs based on solution-processed semiconductors. 

A superstar in the family of solution-processed semiconductors is metal halide perovskites, which have shown great success in photovoltaic applications during the past few years. The same perovskites can also been applied in LEDs. Despite being at an early stage of development with associated challenges, metal halide perovskites provide great promise as a new generation of materials for low-cost LEDs.

This project aims to develop high-efficiency and stable perovskite LEDs based on solution-processed perovskites. Two different classes of low-dimensional perovskites will be investigated independently. These new perovskites materials will then be coupled with novel interface engineering to fabricate perovskite LEDs with the performance beyond the state of the art. At the core of the research is the synthesis of new perovskite nanostructures, combined with advanced spectroscopic characterization and device development. This project combines recent advances in perovskite optoelectronics and low-dimensional materials to create a new paradigm for perovskite LEDs. This research will also lead to the development of new perovskites materials which will serve future advances in photovoltaics, transistors, lasers, etc.",2017-03-01,2022-02-28,1499759.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
1919,809046,TREEPAD,An eco-innovative planting and survival support system for urban trees,"Harsh urban growing conditions have caused the vitality of urban trees to fall drastically during the last 30 - 40 years . Urban tree mortality is the highest among the youngest trees, especially in the first two to three years after transplanting  which results in enormous costs for replanting. In parallel, the market is steadily increasing, European cities and municipalities are planning to plant around 200 million trees in the next 25 years.  In order to use this market opportunity, our company, LORBERG has successfully developed TREEPAD, an innovative and cost-effective, all-in-one survival support system for urban trees.  TREEPAD will ensure an easy and fast planting process and high survival rate even years after transplantation by addressing the three main problems of newly transplanted trees: anchoring, water supply, and a balanced nutrient supply. In addition, TREEPAD is able to communicate its water supply status to the client. TREEPAD consists of a semi-flexible sheet of slow biodegradable, bio-based polymers (i.e. polylactic acid blends, or poly-3hydrohybutyrate) with anchoring spots, which will attach to the burlap sack that contains the roots, providing the stability required by the tree to thrive in its new location. Furthermore, the biopolymer sheet contains pockets filled with hydrogel, which will be loaded with water upon plantation and will release it slowly after planting. In addition, specific nutrient mixes will be added to the hydrogel, which will release them also during the liberation of water to achieve a fertilization effect. The results obtained by us during the development phase indicate that TREEPAD would boost the survival rate to at least a 95% of planted urban trees and will reduce the planting cost and time needed by 80%.",2018-03-01,2018-06-30,50000.0,,['biopolymer'],1,1

1921,808774,Multi-AD Feasibility,High performance MULTIphase Anaerobic Digester for agroindustrial wastewater treatment,"Food & Drink (F&D) industry is one of the most water consuming sectors, and is considered one of the largest producers of wastewater, producing roughly 2.17 million m3/day of wastewater in Europe. This is the largest manufacturing sector in EU, composed mainly by SMEs (>99%). 
Technically, anaerobic digesters are NOT optimised for small volumes (<1,000 m3). So, most industrial wastewater treatment technologies are optimised for much larger volumes (average: 2,500 m3). Economically, these technologies are very expensive (>1Mâ‚¬). Thus, only big companies implement anaerobic digestors. Until now. In AEMA, we have been able to downscale a disruptive small scale anaerobic digestor for wastewater treatment, addressed to F&D industry: Multi-AD.
Multi-AD is a high performance MULTIphase Anaerobic Digester tailor-made for treating wastewater generated in Food and Drink SMEs. It is fully sensorised, being able to self-regulate basic operational parameters (T, flowâ€¦) for its auto-operation depending on the kind of wastewater characteristics it needs to treat. It will generate 80% methane-rich biogas that be partially used -50%- for its operation, and partially used -50%- for other energy-demanding industrial tasks (e.g. heating, at the industry choice), with average economic savings of 15,000â‚¬/year (when treating 100 m3/d) and 11% less CO2 emissions. 
We will commercialise it in the most important EU28 countries in terms of F&D industry, and as well in some countries in Latin America, being the flagship product for our internationalisation.  
We plan to sell in the first five commercialisation years 108 units of the device, what will imply that we will sum up to AEMAâ€™s team 14 persons. The project will have a ROI of 2.82. 
This Multi-AD project will contribute to ensure the safe and efficient use of water resources, to have a resource-efficient industrial sector in the whole EU, and ultimately to foster the use of renewable energy in industry.",2018-01-01,2018-04-30,50000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

The main existing drinking water solutions, intending to overcome the low quality/scarcity of superficial fresh water sources, are bottled water, desalination plants, water tanks or aquifers. However, they all present significant gaps, as they are unsustainable, polluting or they require high CAPEX/OPEX. On the other hand, atmospheric water generators have a reduced cost/l and although, they constitute a promising, though yet unknown solution for the domestic sector, they currently lack energy efficiency, manufacturing capacity and solid sales network. These gaps generate significant market opportunities in the drinking water industry (expected to reach â‚¬1.2 trillion by 2025) for our innovation.
With GENAQ we aim to provide a drinking water generation solution wherever needed with zero environmental impact. Our AWGs are drinking water production units harvesting the humidity in the air to produce condensed drinking water of high purity anywhere in the world. We produce water with excellent properties, which fully complies with WHO standards/EU laws and is certified by EU health authorities. Our system decreases the use of plastic bottles, and achieves 50% more water production with 150% reduced energy consumption (0.19 kWh/l), compared to existing AWG solutions under the same conditions. Our AWGs can be autonomous, using sustainable power sources, resulting in almost zero OPEX. The successful commercialization of this project, based on the distributed production of water will reach a cumulative turnover of â‚¬135.6M by 2025.

1923,807212,geoBone,geoBone: A Unique Mineral Supplement for Bone Health and Prevention of Osteoporosis SustainablyProduced from Geothermal Resources through a Ground-breaking Process.,"The progressive ageing of the population is coming accompanied by a long list of chronic conditions. Among them is the loss
of bone density, a natural process that begins after the age of 30. The risk of fracture grows proportionally to the disruption
of the bone architecture, advancing from minor osteopenia to severe osteoporosis, which is a global public health concern
that affects today 200 million people. In the EU, the costs derived from osteoporotic fractures reach today â‚¬37billion.
Although the reason for bone loss in the adult age is poorly understood, it is believed to be due to a lower capability to
absorb minerals from our diet. Thus, in the adult age clinicians recommend the intake of mineral supplements to cover for
the dietary insufficiency. Although most bone health supplements are based on calcium, it is the mineral silica the one with
higher impact on bone mineralization. Despite its recognized effects on bone and connective tissue, its market uptake has
been long hindered due to the low concentration, low bio-availability, inadequate presentation and poor absorption rates of
current supplement products. In response, we at geoSilica have developed geoBone, a silica-rich drinkable supplement that
offers this mineral in high concentrations and in the highest bio-absorbable form. Its properties result from our unique
production method, which purifies silica from the mineral rich water byproducts of geothermal power plants. After validating
the concept and production sustainability, this project aims to take geoBone to market readiness by finalising its
development & industrialising its production process. The Feasibility Study planned in Phase 1 will serve to warrant the
project from all technical, commercial & financial standpoints. Besides bringing huge benefits for society, healthcare and

Also in Europe, the number of plastic street containers for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) exceeds ten million. The average lifetime of these articles ranges from five to ten years. When they break, these items are discarded and replaced with new ones. Discarded items have three destinations: recycling, incineration or as landfill. The owners of these plastic elements barely consider the possibility of their repair.
At Plastic Repair System, we have developed and patented an industrial technology for the repair of reusable plastic articles, which allows their use with total confidence and guarantees, while the cost of repair is less than one third of the new value of the same article. Repairs undertaken with PRS technology have been analysed by independent laboratories that have certified that PRS recovers 100% of the object's functionality and at least 98% of its original strength. 
The industrialization of processes allows the systematic repair of large volumes of plastic articles, achieving significant cost savings for our customers, as well as environmental advantages. We estimate that our technology will help to reduce the carbon footprint in at least 0.89 Kg CO2 per Kg of repaired plastic item.
After having successfully tested our technology on a small scale, we want to expand our Business Model internationally, starting with Europe. In fact, some customers with plants in several countries have asked us to extend our service to their plants in other countries. We have received also interest from two European venture capital funds focused in innovative companies in the circular economy.

1926,807961,LEDVAR-Z,A New Paradigm for Efficient and Modern Rail Signalling,"Electransâ€™ aim is to improve the current rail signalling system and to take a step forward towards the full implementation of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
The current rail signalling system remains shockingly antiquated throughout the world. Firstly, the electronic signalâ€™s messages are fixed during production. This means that customised signals must be designed, ordered and manufactured every time needs change. Secondly, there is a huge amount of cables and interlocking stations that require installation and maintenance and increase operational expenditures. Thirdly, the current railway monitoring system is rudimentary and requires unnecessary energy consumption.
The solution we propose, LEDVAR-Z, is an innovative ITC system that will standardise and modernise railway signalling, making it more efficient. It is composed of high-quality LED signals able to display any type of light or message and software that intelligently monitors and controls what is displayed. Fewer interlocking stations will be needed and they can communicate with signals through fibre optic cables or radio networks. As a result, LEDVAR-Z will drastically reduce costs for railway companies, streamline rail projects and improve rail traffic control management.

Road traffic accidents are the main leading cause of death for people aged between 15 to 29 years old, which cost governments approximately 3% of their GDP (WHO, Global Road Safety Report on 2015).
In average, a speed reduction of only 5% can reduce by 30% the number of fatal crashes. In cities, a speed reduction from 50 km/h to 30 km/h can reduce the probability of fatality in an accident from 45% to 10% (Holzmann, 2008). Adding to this, 38% of the pedestrian deaths in car accidents happen in crosswalks.
PAVNEXT is a beyond state-of-the-art award-wiing Speed Reduction Systems that maximizes speed reduction without the need for any action from the driver, while minimizing the occupant discomfort and the impact on vehicles.
In addition to the speed reduction function, PAVNEXT also harvests the vehicles kinetic energy, converting it with a very high efficiency into electrical energy that can be injected into the public grid, or used locally for other safety purposes (e.g. lighting signals), while collecting significant road traffic and energy production data.
For the past 4 years we focused on technological development (currently demonstrating in real environment) and fundraising, and we have also accumulated significant recognition and developed a relevant network of partners, potential customers and other stakeholders.
Our beachhead market is crosswalk areas in cities above 150 thousand inhabitants, and motorway operators will follow. 
The successful market entry of PAVNEXT will mean increased safety for pedestrians and drivers, fewer road traffic accidents, a more comfortable urban driving experience, reduced vehicle maintenance needs, more clean energy production and efficiency, atmospheric pollution reduction and, ultimately, better road traffic management.",2018-02-01,2018-07-31,50000.0,,['traffic management'],1,1

Their energy options have been limited to kerosene lamps, diesel and biomass. These are harmful to health, carbon intensive, and a barrier to economic growth.

Falling solar PV prices mean Solar Home Systems (â€œSHSâ€) are becoming an affordable solution to providing energy access to millions in Africa. Since 2010, 14m SHS have been sold in the region, with a projected market of 33m SHS per year by 2020 ($1.7bn pa market).

Currently, there is a price disparity facing lower end â€œpico-systemâ€ consumers (<10W) who pay 9x more for electricity than owners of large systems (>100W). This is a punitive charge on the poorest consumers and is a barrier to basic electricity access for millions.

A more affordable solution is peer-to-peer sharing of energy from large SHS in a nanogrid. This would provide cheaper energy, whilst offering a cost-saving opportunity for SHS owners. 

SHS companies have the products and sales channels, SteamaCo has the platform and technical expertise. To manage these grids in a cost-effective manner requires remote monitoring, control and automation, which must be user-friendly, low-cost, and reliable in remote regions of Africa. Using innovative comms technologies repurposed for the Africa, SteamaCo brings a price disruptive offering to this unserved market.

The feasibility study will include an analysis of; African market viability, worldwide competition, hardware and software development roadmap, local market regulatory issues, and unit economic financial viability.

The outcome will be a business plan with recommendations. We will use this plan to fund phase 2, the commercial development of the smart management system.

Desalting seawater is an excellent potential solution but traditional reverse osmosis (R/O) desalination systems require a connection to a strong electrical grid. However, because developing countries typically lack sufficient electrical grid capacity and cannot afford the capital or time required to build and deploy traditional R/O systems, RML is proposing an innovative solution to this problem - the worldâ€™s first wave-driven desalination system (called Wave2Oâ„¢) that can be deployed quickly, operate completely â€œoff-gridâ€ and supply large quantities of fresh water at competitive cost. 
As a medium-scale, grid-independent, renewable energy driven water production system, we believe Wave2Oâ„¢ will have wide-ranging utility in developing countries and island nations outside Europe. Inside Europe, potential markets include the overseas Departments and Territories linked to EU member states (e.g. Canary Islands, New Caledonia, etc.). RML has already been active in several countries and has obtained commitments for pilot-scale Wave2Oâ„¢ plants in Cape Verde, South Africa and Mauritius. 
We believe Cape Verde represents the shortest path to commercialization. The pilot location has been already secured and the site assessment studies are expected to start in Q3 2017 financed by the African Development Bank through a $1.0M SEFA (Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa) grant.

1934,728086,WOODnat,Second generation of planted hardwood forests in the EU,"The past EU funding programs for the afforestation of agricultural marginal areas promoted many walnut quality hardwood planted forests in southern Europe, which are mostly small to medium-sized and dispersed in the territory. Although southern European countries have intensively invested in research on walnut silviculture and genetics, the owners of small planted forests lack the know-how needed to properly manage their plantations, being a majority of them poorly managed or abandoned. Moreover, the average age of the walnut plantations and their need for thinnings imply that large quantities of small-diameter trees will be produced in the years to come. However, small-dimensioned European walnut logs are not demanded by wood industry because of the higher transformation costs and because of the competition of the American walnut.
WOODNat, focused on the whole walnut hardwood-chain, aims at increasing the use of quality walnut hardwood produced under sustainable management practices in planted forests of southern Europe, which implies adding value to the whole chain of the walnut hardwood market, involving the different stakeholders of the market. To help this approach, WOODNat will benefit from biotechnology, robotics, and the development of a mobile app. Thanks to WOODNat, walnut plant nurseries will improve characteristics of walnut plants in order to reach a higher standard in the market while increasing nursery productivity, and will keep after-sale contact with plantation managers to get feedback of the success of the walnut plants. A whole package of environmentally sustainable management practices, including sustainable innovative approaches to degrade by-products, will be implemented in walnut planted forests, not only in new plantations but also in many now abandoned or poorly-managed exploitations. Such package of good practices will increase not only productivity, but also multifunctionality of walnut plantations",2016-10-01,2019-09-30,2210305.72,,['afforestation'],1,1
1935,703107,CH4ScarabDetect,Detecting and quantifying CH4 emissions from scarab larvae using stable carbon isotopes,"The increase of the average global atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration from about 700 ppb to 1800 ppb since 1750 is the result of a global imbalance between CH4 sources and sinks. Even small changes in source or sink strength are expected to have a rapid impact on the atmospheric CH4 concentration, making CH4 an excellent candidate for short-term climate change mitigation strategies. However, this mitigation potential can only be accessed if we can accurately quantify all sinks and sources contributing to the global CH4 budget. One of the poorly understood aspects of the global CH4 budget is the effect of land-use change and soil management on the CH4 budget of soils which themselves can be either sinks or sources of atmospheric CH4. The central drawback in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling net soil CH4 fluxes is our insufficient knowledge on gross CH4 fluxes and the involved organisms. The project â€œCH4ScarabDetectâ€ aims to provide the first quantitative estimate of the importance of soil-dwelling cockchafer larvae for net soil CH4 fluxes. These important European agricultural and forest pests are qualitatively known to emit CH4, but have thus far been neglected in terrestrial CH4 cycle research. To reach its aim, â€œCH4ScarabDetectâ€ will develop a new non-invasive field monitoring method for separating gross CH4 production and gross CH4 oxidation in soils in general, and for detecting larvae infestations in particular, by combining for the very first time the well-known chamber flux method with a 13CH4 isotope pool dilution technique and acoustic measurements of larvae sounds. This novel approach will not only further our understanding of the role of cockchafer larvae in the terrestrial CH4 cycle and provide a new tool for soil CH4 flux and soil insect studies, but promises to also improve the monitoring of cockchafer infestations, thus generating new knowledge of major relevance for both scientific and practical reasons.",2016-05-01,2018-04-30,171460.8,,['soil management'],1,1

The RegoLight project will investigate the sintering process of lunar regolith simulants by means of concentrated sun light in order to prepare for future lunar missions for building infrastructure (leveled terrain, dust shelters, launch pads etc.) and structural components for lunar habitats.
Solar sintering of regolith is currently at TRL3 , being able to build a regolith â€˜brickâ€™ in a laboratory set-up with a moving table in a solar furnace. RegoLight aims at enhancing this specific additive layer manufacturing technique â€“which seems very promising for lunar applications since it does not involve any consumablesâ€“ by further characterizing the parameters for sintering different types of regolith and by developing a movable printing head capable both of pointing the concentrated solar beam at the required spot and of deploying incrementally additional layers of regolith in order to continue with the additive building process.
Based on the mechanical properties of solar sintered regolith architectural scenarios and applications will be developed, taking into account the benefits of additive layer manufacturing and novel construction concepts for lunar gravity. This detailed Finite Element Modeling will provide a first insight into lunar architectural scenarios using this technology: With a concurrent engineering approach sample structures will be printed having been derived from â€˜big pictureâ€™ scenarios and bottom up approaches at the same time.

However, Europe has numerous historic buildings, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment in order to fulfil the requirements of sustainability and use.
When responsible bodies do spend money anyway, it seems logical and ecologically worthwhile to apply â€œsoftâ€ maintenance procedures, which save costs and also reduce energy consumption of historic buildings. Integrating these buildings into national climate change and energy policies seems therefore quite necessary and a challenge, as far as appropriate techniques and procedures are concerned, which can only be met through excellently trained craftsmen and apprentices of the crafts concerned.
PRO-Heritage partners aim to offer initial and permanent education for professionals and craftsmen providing traditional competences and skills for built heritage, based on Best Practice of partner organisations. Additionally, PRO-Heritage is going to establish a structure and environment for regular journeyman's travel in Europe, in order to further support the exchange of competences and skills across Europe.

Customers such as Audi, Daimler and Volvo have set a target 10% weight and cost reduction for CNG tanks, to increase efficiency and reduce vehicle cost. 

Most CNG tanks are made from a metal or polymer liner, over-wound with a carbon/epoxy composite, but:

â€¢	Wet-winding of carbon/epoxy is slow, so limits cost-effective production
â€¢	Their properties vary by up to 10%, so excess material is used to compensate 

To meet the customer targets, Plastic Omnium has developed a new process for the fast, efficient production of CNG tanks, using 8-axis robotic tape placement cell from MF Tech, and high quality carbon/polyamide tape developed by Coventive Composites. 

Together, these technologies can reduce CNG tank weight by 10% and cost by 20%. The technologies are currently at TRL 6, and the objective is to overcome the 3 remaining barriers to demonstration at TRL 7/8:

1.	Materials: Optimise and upscale the carbon/polyamide tapes to meet cost, accuracy and property needs
2.	Process: Enhance the vessel-winding process to meet performance, weight and quality requirements
3.	Product: Upscale the manufacture of carbon/polyamide CNG tanks, to enable economic production

Overcoming these barriers will trigger our customers to start certification of the carbon/polyamide CNG tanks, as the next step in our commercialisation plan.

The USP is that no other CNG tanks can offer the required weight and cost savings.  Our customers have a requirement of 150,000 tanks per annum, and Plastic Omnium forecasts sales of 20,000 tanks (â‚¬11.7m) by 2025/26.

OHMIO is the only HTM that is flexible enough to fit TFPV cells, achieving higher efficiencies because of their higher layer transparency in the IR range, reducing production costs and avoiding the use of corona treatment or similar.
OHMIO will solve main current problems related to HTM: water severely damage the organic material layers (OHMIO is formulated without water), strong acid compositions reduce the TFPV shelf life (OHMIO is formulated in a liquid with selected additives and solvents) and high manufacturing costs (OHMIO will reduce the production process costs of an electronic device by up to 80%. OHMIO will involve savings of up to 200% in raw materials and several reductions of the carbon footprint.

Livestock production is the largest contributor to ammonia emissions of increased concern in the EU and low emission manure management technologies are needed. However, less than 8% of the livestock manure produced in Europe is processed, with large variations within regions. Furthermore, properly treated manure could serve as a valuable source of organic matter and nutrients for fertilizing crops and for energy production, replacing current fossil-based products. 

The current project aims to develop a new and efficient treatment technology to reduce environmental impacts from animal manure which will make a substantial contribution for a more sustainable and environmental friendly agriculture practice, gaining economic value from the reuse of treated manures to replace mineral fertilizer, contributing to a biobased and circular economy.

The project will cover fundamental understanding of mechanisms involved in different acidification treatments, the development (with industry) of a new and sustainable acidification practice, and improving the fertiliser value of products.

The problem has been addressed by some biodegradable solutions such as  bioplastic, paper or even bamboo containers. However, they still need at least half a year to degrade. From the other side, there is also immense amount of wheat bran which is a side product of the milling industry. The only use of that bran is feed for animals, otherwise it becomes waste in a few weeks. Hence, its efficient disposal is problematic, and - in result - bran has very low market value. Biotremâ€™s mission is to solve both the problems at the same time. We invented the proprietary technology which allows to use the wheat bran to make the containers. In this project we introduce water resistant and edible take-away food containers, which are biodegradable within 30 days - Branboxes. Currently, the major issue for the containers is the water resistance and biodegradability which is a great challenge to achieve at the same time in the single product.

About 20% of farmland soil in China require urgent remediation action. Urban soils are contaminated by Pb-based paint and emissions from the combustion of leaded gasoline in all major cities in US. Lead was identified by WHO as 1 of 10 chemicals of major public health concern. Urban soil is a lingering source of lead poisoning in children. Most countries have made the clean-up and restoration of the contaminated land a priority thus creating the opportunity for soil preserving remediation options. The remediation of contaminated soil is essential for the protection of environmental resources and human health. There are no effective and sustainable (soil preserving) remediation technologies for soils contaminated primarily with Pb. Excavation with landfilling is unfortunately still one of the most used solutions (used in 82-84% of cases. ReSoil is the single available remediation option which efficiently removes Pb and other toxic metals from contaminated soils and preserves soil as a natural resource. ReSoil is EDTA-based soil-washing technology with innovative technology for recycling of EDTA and process waters in closed-loop and thus ensuring generation of no liquid wastes. ReSoil is a breakthrough, globally important green environmental innovation in the verge of commercialization. ReSoil demonstration plant (6 t/day) and demonstration garden are available. Low operation and remediation cost, no environmental emission and preserving soil as a natural resource for safe food production make ReSoil technology disruptive innovation in the growing soil remediation market (8% annual growth rate).

Hence, understanding the main environmental controls on tree water use is essential to address relevant questions posed by global change-related impacts on forest ecosystem services, including water availability and carbon sequestration. Sap flow measurements using thermal methods have now been applied to measure seasonal patterns in water use and the response of transpiration to environmental drivers across hundreds of species of woody plants worldwide, covering a wide range of climates, soils and stand structural characteristics. Here, we will design and begin to assemble a  global database of sub-daily, tree-level sap flow (SAPFLUXNET) that will be used to improve our understanding of physiological and structural determinants of plant transpiration and to further investigate the role of vegetation in controlling global water balance. I will collectively analyse sap flow responses to environmental drivers, at time scales from daily to seasonal and annual, using statistical and mechanistic models of plant water transport. I will synthesise the database into a set of traits related to physiological regulation of transpiration.

ISCs are very complex organisations with work being carried out at geographically dispersed sites, and involving international stakeholder groups from across the realms of science, policy, and industry. As these ISCs are becoming more important in efforts to address global challenges in areas such as health, the environment, and clean energy, our understanding of the distinctive organizational dynamics governing these consortia has lagged behind. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for novel organisational theory and frameworks that will advance our understanding of ISCs. INSCONS is an ambitious effort to address this need, using a comparative, interdisciplinary approach. Three case studies of large, international ISCs in nuclear fusion research, biomedicine, and the geosciences are at the core of INSCONS. The INSCONS project will examine four aspects of these ISCs. It will 1) Map the internal organisational dynamics of ISCs using interviews, bibliometric network analyses, and ethnographic field studies on everyday work in ISCs. 2) It will study ISCsâ€™ interactions with the broader scientific community by conducting a survey among researchers in the scholarly fields ISCs operate in, and by analysing these fieldsâ€™ co-authorship networks. 3) It will examine the (inter)national political processes and bureaucratic wrangling shaping ISCs. 4) It will examine relationships of dependency and influence between ISCs and industry through case studies as well as analyses of patenting and publication activities. Taken together, the project outputs of INSCONS will bring into clear focus the sociology and politics, as well as the operational complexities that govern this important, new organisational form in contemporary science.",2019-09-01,2024-08-31,1997021.0,,['nuclear fusion'],1,1

If so, then you are aware of one of the key problems in the Caps and Closures carbonated beverage market: the lack of sustainability. Current closures systems for sparkling wine, beers or carbonated soft drinks are underperforming due their highly demanding features and their current linear take-make-dispose system of use. Among technical challenges in the production and expedition processes are: oxidation in humid environments (e.g. during the production of sparkling wine in the traditional mÃ©thode Champenoise), difficulty in recycling multi-material closures like metal screw caps, non-reusability features (e.g. cork closure are not reusable), and the increased costs and production downtimes due to bottle breakage caused by the high force applied to the bottle in crown corks. Thus, current systems are inefficient in terms of sensorial, technical and environmental performance and do not comply with circular economy packaging requirements.
The Twist & Pop closure system is based on a unique patented mono-material design that does not compromise the sensorial neutrality, ensures the sealing of the carbonated beverages bottles and most importantly is 100% recyclable and reusable. Our innovative technology (TRL6) is the solution for the current sustainability challenges of the Caps & Closures market. We have more than 15 years of R&D trajectory and a solid ecosystem of stakeholders (e.g. Importacions Decavi, Della Toffola Group, HUSKY Injection Molding System).

Within this framework the re-use of thermoplastic composites, is a recurrent topic within the aircraft manufacturing industry which needs a suitable solution for the high performance thermoplastic composites once the craft is dismantled. PEEK (Polyether ether ketone) and PPS (Polyphenylene sulphide) all together reinforced with CF (Carbon Fibre) and, are the most common high performance materials considered as leftovers when their lifecycle has come to an end .
Taking this into account, the RESET project aims to bring a second life to those thermoplastic composites which have been condemned to landfills, to the carbon fibre recovery by means of polymer pyrolysis or to energetic recovery. This milestone will be achieved through a sorting and milling process of these materials, leading to short chopped fibre reinforced thermoplastic granulates. These conditioned leftovers will be subsequently used to obtain new reinforced thermoplastic composites, by melt compounding along with virgin polymer, considering both monocomponent as well as binary blends. Besides, an evaluation of the properties of recycled materials will be carried out in terms of repeatability, processability and final product properties in order to ensure the suitability of the products regarding the final application of the demonstrators (e.g, brackets, clips...). With that purpose, process parameters will be defined during the design and evaluation of the prototypes mould. 
Summing up, the RESET project will lead to a whole new family of rCFRP reducing, therefore, the environmental footprint by giving a second life to the waste, by means of recycled high value products within the aircraft manufacturing value chain, redounding in the aerospacial economy through a closed-loop cycle philosophy.",2016-01-01,2018-04-30,325006.25,,['recycling'],1,1

These recognise that in order to reach a European near zero waste economy, all value chain stakeholders must cooperate, exchange generated knowledge, insights and hands-on experience and enforce changes to the value chain structure together. Previous initiatives were unable to achieve actual, large scale results towards a sustainable growth of the European economy. The reason is that they either focussed on a  specific waste area or they lacked the involvement of the competent industries. This project includes various waste value chains which enable exchange of information and technology transfer from one chain to another. In addition, the consortiumâ€™s network includes over 2000 relevant industrial stakeholders and several already expressed their interest in this new stakeholder platform, its goals and actions. During the project, key stakeholders will be mobilised to participate in the platform and road mapping workshops, as only an active involvement of industrial organisations will lead to the desired changes in the structure of the value chain. The many letters of support show the consortium's strength in mobilising stakeholders.

NEW_InnoNetâ€™s main objective is to mobilise stakeholders towards building a circular economy by developing and reinforcing solid foundations for building the European Near-Zero Waste Platform through:

A fascinating strategy to restore the advantages of stored CO2 as a raw material would be to consider a slow biological upgrading process of CO2 in deep geological formations. 
Significantly, the recent development of microfluidic tools to study pore-scale phenomena under high pressure, opens new avenues to investigate such strategies. Thus, the strategic objective of this project is to develop and to use â€œBiological Geological Laboratories on a Chip - BioGLoCsâ€ mimicking reservoir conditions in order to gain greater understanding in the mechanisms associated with the biogeological conversion process of CO2 to methane in CGS environment at pore scale. 
The specific objectives are: (1) to determine the experimental conditions for the development of competent micro-organisms (methanogens) and to establish the methane production rates depending on the operating parameters, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of a H2 in situ production strategy (required to sustain the methanogenesis process), (3) to investigate the full bioconversion process in 2D and 3D, (4) to demonstrate the process scaling from pore scale to liter scale and (5) to evaluate the overall process performance.
This multidisciplinary project gathering expertise in chemical engineering and geomicrobiology will be the first ever use of microfluidics approaches to investigate a biogeological transformation taking into account the thermo-hydro-bio-chemical processes. It will result in the identification of efficient geomicrobiological methods and materials to accelerate the CO2 to methane biogeoconversion process.

An electrolyte with inherent potential towards Al based batteries and posterior commercialisation. CAPSEL may represent a good alternative to Li based batteries as Al is an abundant, cheaper and less reactive metal compared to Li. The formulation of CAPSEL can be easily adapted to other ions, such as Na and Li. Furthermore, a solid electrolyte can solve many of the safety risks existing in commercially available batteries, in addition to allowing a significant reduction in their size and weight. We expect this project to give an important contribution towards a new class of highly efficiency batteries whose disposal route offers no environmental impacts. This is only possible because of its biodegradable polymeric binder and cellulose as major constituents of the electrolyte. Therefore, CAPSEL can follow conventional recycling routes of paper after the batteries' end-life cycle. CAPSEL also enables the power supply of low-cost and large area disposable applications like e-paper, smart labels and smart packing.

OneSky builds the infrastructure allowing tomorrowâ€™s drone revolution, ensuring their safe integration into todayâ€™s aviation world. We offer an online platform, which gathers data from a network of scaled-down control towers collecting maximum of information on the position of every flying object in the sky, manned or unmanned. Our technology will allow virtually everybody to see the air traffic surrounding them and take the most appropriate measures. Thus, what OneSky brings to the aviation world is intelligent air traffic instruments and automatic collision avoidance tools, enabling low-risk flight plans and avoidance strategies and creating a safer smarter sky for all. This will unlock the full potential of drones across many sectors such as Infrastructure, agriculture, mining, surveying, film and industry as well as disaster management among other sectors. OneSkyConnect will facilitate the opening up of lower airspace for drone operation unlocking their full potential which will in turn result in massive economic, environmental and social benefits. Professional drone users lose on average â‚¬25k per year per drone because of current restrictions. OneSkyConnect will result in the lifting of these restrictions and opening up of the lower airspace for a multitude of drone applications. The use of drones will reduce complexity, optimise costs and create new business opportunities for the operators unlocking a business potential of â‚¬120 billion by 2020.",2018-05-01,2018-08-31,50000.0,,['traffic management'],1,1
1971,651407,Ultroslag,"A new integrated sustainable processing system for â€˜metal from slagâ€™ recovery with higher technical, economic, energy and environmental performance than existing recovery processes.","Slag is a by-product of metal smelting, and ~3.5 million tpa are produced globally in refining Non Ferrous Metals (NFM) and making alloys. Slag contains impurities and forms a protective crust of non-metallic & metallic oxides, and contains significant â€˜freeâ€™ & alloyed metal (from 10 to 70% by weight). While slag can be used as aggregate, there are increasing concerns over â€˜leachingâ€™ of heavy metals into water courses from using these materials in civil engineering. While some metal can be recovered by re-melting slag (at very high temp), this is extremely expensive with very high energy burden which often makes recovery un-economic, but necessary. Landfill of slag is increasingly not an option. Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called â€˜implosionâ€™ to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles. This will be combined with ultrasonic vibration sieving for accelerated recovery of metal from the finest fraction. This novel technology was originally developed to recycle waste glass by reducing it to fine â€˜sandâ€™, with uniform size and no â€˜sharpsâ€™ compared to normal crushing techniques. This technology has not been applied commercially to other materials. Benefits to partners, endusers & society could be: 
â€¢ Rapid recovery of more metal from slag at relatively low cost
â€¢ Strategic control of metal recovered rather than losing control throâ€™ export to â€˜low costâ€™ economies 
â€¢ Enable smelters to recycle slag in-house, increasing their â€˜Value Addâ€™ while reducing â€˜recycle-milesâ€™
â€¢ 97% energy saving throâ€™ low cost mechanical separation rather than very high temp. melt recycling
â€¢ Huge cut in carbon emissions from thermal energy saved and â€˜recycle-milesâ€™ saved

The ultimate goal is to launch a new process in the market, through an innovative application of a relatively new technology to selectively break down the non-metallic components of slag from the metallic particles.",2014-10-01,2015-03-31,50000.0,,['recycling'],1,1

A large, unmet, and growing patient population will require treatment for Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and revenue in this market will continue to grow driven by the aging population and the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the most widely used non-surgical treatment, however when used in areas of long calcified stenosis, PTA does not show satisfactory results at long term follow up. Stenting has become the most obvious choice to overcome the limitations of PTA. Unfortunately, long term performance of stents appears to be problematic as they do not prevent (and may to a certain extent even cause) a failure mode known as restenosis. Whilst covered stents have tackled the problem of restenosis within the stent the stent itself interrupts the bloods natural spiral laminar flow (SLF) and increases laterally directed forces and wall shear stress downstream of the implantation causing downstream disease progression. Re-institution of the bloods SLF reduces the forces and turbulence caused by stenting, and reduces neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) distal to the stent which can lead to occlusion distal to the stent.

The global objective of the project is to develop an innovative endovascular stent that will reintroduce the natural spiral laminar flow both through the stent and distal to the stent that can be manufactured to be deployed using standard delivery system profiles. With the long term post project target of increasing patency rates to greater than 80% and reduce restenosis of the stent by greater than 20% and distal stenosis by greater than 20% at 2 year follow up. 

As a result of the proposed project, we expect to improve our collective competitiveness and generate increased sales by capturing at least â‚¬25M p.a. of the European market for endovascular stents",2014-10-01,2015-02-28,50000.0,,['PV'],1,1

En3, a young technology company, founded in 2009 in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, has developed an expansion device for small scale Waste Heat Recovery systems (WHR-systems). Small scale means a net AC power rating of the WHR-system from about 1 to 50 kW. 
EN3â€™s WHR-system is based on the Clausius Rankine Cycle (CRC) or alternatively on the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology and can substantially improve the efficiency of industrial processes, engines and facilities. They lower the primary energy consumption, improve the efficiency of engines and processes, reduce emissions and protect the environment and resources.
The great advantage of the technology is the flexibility in terms of the heat source. In principle WHR-systems can be adapted to different kinds of heat sources. Above-average market potential for the environmentally friendly and CO2 neutral electricity and heat production is identified for waste heat delivered from exhaust gas of combustion engines. Further applications are seen in the power generation through biomass combustion as well as in the geothermal and solar thermal energy generation.
The objective of the overall innovation project (phase one to three) is to develop and commercialise EN3â€™s small scale WHR-technology. 
The objective of this feasibility study (phase one)  is an analysis of the market for EN3â€™s small scale WHR-systems in the EU leading to an elaborated business plan showing entry and growth markets in Europe and outlining a clear plan of ENâ€™s path forward - both financially and technically.

Therefore, they find potential commercial applications in several sectors of economic activity. Some of them are already commercially viable, such as aquaculture, agriculture, human nutrition or cosmetics, while some others still need R&D to be further developed, such as bioenergy or feed. 

In addition, bearing in mind that microalgae are the most efficient natural CO2 capturing system, are very productive and do not compete with fertile lands, they have potential to simultaneously contribute to palliate the big crisis humankind is facing: environmental sustainability, energetic efficiency, and food security. 

AlgaEnergy, a solid Spanish biotechnology based SME, did identify this potential. Since its establishment, it has served as a vehicle to consolidate the existing knowledge within the scientific field of microalgae in Spain -a recognized international hub in the matter-, which was dispersed across universities. Using it as a stepping stone, it has been investing in generating further R&D in order to scale-up the processes and develop ready to market products, so that the achievements in the laboratory phase reach also the society. 

Within this task, AlgaEnergy has recently been able to reach a semi-industrial scale (TRL 7) with the start of the first phase operations of its semi-industrial plant in South of Spain, that captures real flue gas emissions directly from the second biggest combined cycle plant in Europe, being a worldwide premier. Therefore, AlgaEnergy is now ready to orientate its technology towards the commercialization of its already commercially viable products.

1977,807221,PairElOx,Paired Electrochemical Oxidation process for feasible industrial production of the crucial FDCA building block for the bioplastic industry,"AVA Biochem is a specialty chemicals company and produces the premium platform chemical 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from renewable biomass. We are the owner of the worldâ€™s 1st industrial plant for production of 5-HMF from biomass. Recently the company has added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) to its product portfolio. FDCA is considered as a top 12 Top Value-Added Chemicals, which can be used in a wide variety of applications, most significantly in the production of Polyethylene Furanoate (PEF), a polyester ideal for packaging. Most plastic bottles are made from PET (oil-based polyethylene terephthalate) but PEF is a superior polymer. It offers a better barrier for CO2 and O2, is stronger but thinner and has a longer shelf life. PEF is a bio-based substitute for oil-based PET. However, in the market, there is not an industrial commercial process to produce FDCA because of the price. After a long R&D way, we offers an HMF from biomass, which a price more than 2000% lower than currently. Diverse approaches for the oxidation of HMF to FDCA have been developed usually with uncompleted conversion. However, we have developed a continuous, integrated pilot plant for the oxidation of HMF in water with paired electrochemical oxidation to obtain FDCA and its purification. This technology has advantages since the oxidant is substituted by electrons, and the oxidation occurs at both anode and cathode, thus the produced waste and energy are minimized. Applying this concept we obtain FDCA with yields >99% in the lab and a purity of 99.95 wt%. The selectivity is >90% without any dangerous by-products. The process also takes place in water so neither hazardous organic solvents are necessary. It is considered as a green process because an energy savings of 66% and GHG emissions reductions by 35% are realized. Thus, the bio-based FDCA end-product will be offered to the market at much lower price than currently, having a crucial role to play in the PEF bioplastic packaging.",2018-04-01,2018-07-31,50000.0,,['bioplastic'],1,1

1979,656778,Class II PI3K,Characterization of the signalling and physiological roles of the class II PI3Ks,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that generate intracellular second messengers in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways and are important drug targets. This proposal seeks to delineate the roles and mechanism of action of a group of PI3Ks which have remained enigmatic ever since their discovery over a decade ago.
The PI3K family comprises eight members in three subclasses. Class I PI3Ks signal downstream of growth factor and G protein-coupled receptors, are amongst the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and are being exploited as drug targets. The class II and III PI3Ks have in part emerged as regulators of membrane trafficking pathways but their physiological roles remain poorly understood.
We aim to identify the physiological roles of the class II PI3K-C2Î± and Î² and to characterize the impact of their kinase activity on signalling pathways. To analyse the roles of class II PI3K activity in vivo, the Host Laboratory has created constitutive global and conditional knock-in kinase-inactive mice (unpublished). In contrast to PI3K gene knockout models, these mouse lines allow us to specifically address kinase-dependent functions and hence are an ideal model to evaluate the potential of class II PI3Ks as drug targets.
The class II PI3K-C2Î± (C2Î±) is involved in endo- and exocytosis as well as endocytic recycling, whereas PI3K-C2Î² (C2Î²) has been implicated in cell migration. However, their influence on cellular signalling is unknown. As an initial approach, the Host Laboratory performed a screen for proteins interacting with C2Î± or C2Î² (unpublished). We will explore hits from this screen using the kinase-inactive knock-in mice and cells derived thereof as discovery tools. 
The combination of my expertise in membrane traffic and phosphoinositide regulation with the mouse and signalling studies of the Host Laboratory form an excellent and timely basis to uncover the roles of the class II PI3Ks in mammalian biology.",2016-02-01,2018-01-31,183454.8,,['recycling'],1,1

This convergence could catalyse the transition to new inclusive and circular productive models, such as the â€œdesign global, manufacture localâ€ (DGML) model.

DGML describes the processes through which design is developed as a global digital commons, whereas the manufacturing takes place locally, through shared infrastructures and with local biophysical conditions in mind. DGML seems to form economies of scope that promote sustainability and open innovation while celebrating new ways of cooperation. However, such claims rest on thin conceptual and empirical foundations.

COSMOLOCALISM is a multiphase, pilot-driven investigation of the DGML phenomenon that seeks to understand relevant organisational models, their evolution, and their broader political economy/ecology and policy implications. Through the lens of diverse case studies and participatory action research, the conditions under which the DGML model thrives will be explored.

COSMOLOCALISM has three concurrent streams: practices; innovation; and sustainability. First, DGML practices will be studied, patterns will be recognised and their form, function, cultural values, and governance structure will be determined. Second, the relevant open innovation ecosystems and their potential to reorient design and manufacturing practices will be examined. Third, selected DGML products will be evaluated from an environmental sustainability perspective, involving both qualitative and quantitative methods.

1981,638314,MoNaLISA,Long-term molecular nanoscale imaging of neuronal function,"Synaptic function is difficult to analyze in living neurons using conventional optics, since the synaptic organelles and protein clusters are small and tightly spaced. The solution to this problem can come from the field of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, or nanoscopy. However, the current approaches to nanoscopy are still far from reaching this goal. Single molecule-based approaches (including STORM and PALM) provide high spatial resolution, but slow recording, insufficient for live imaging. Ensemble approaches (including SSIM and STED) are able to record faster, but with poorer resolution or with high, potentially toxic, laser powers. It is currently impossible to image the same neuron for hours and days, with both high spatial (~30 nm) and temporal (10-1000 Hz) resolution, and with minimal photodamage. My aim is to fill this gap, by developing, for the first time, a microscope that combines the advantages of both single molecule-based and ensemble approaches. I will base the microscope on RESOLFT, a low-photodamage ensemble approach that I have pioneered recently. I will use line patterns to speed up the recording and 2photon-switching for 3D ability. I will combine this with sensitive detection schemes that allow single-molecule detection and counting, relying on my previous expertise with PALM and GSDIM. The new set-up, termed molecular nanoscale long-term imaging with sequential acquisition (MoNaLISA), will track neuronal organelles and proteins on different time scales, spanning from milliseconds to days, with a resolution close to the molecular scale. To obtain the first proof-of-principle results, I will address several issues still open in the synaptic transmission field, relating to synaptic vesicle recycling, biogenesis and degradation.

An inexpensive process separates the main components of wood: cellulose and lignin. These can then be turned into final products such as bio-plastics, common chemicals and novel materials.
There are a variety of new value chains that are potentially created through our technology. For example, using the waste wood from a local council, cellulose can be isolated, which is hydrolysed, fermented to succinic acid and then used in paint. The lignin isolated alongside the cellulose can be turned into a drop-in biodiesel sold at the local petrol station. Similarly, sawdust from a timber mill can be fractionated, the cellulose used to produce methylcellulose as a thickener in food, the lignin turned into a bio-derived plastic.
We are diverting wood waste from going to landfill or incineration and sawdust going into pellets. The European pellets market is saturated, also with pellets imported from the Americas. The lignin and cellulose produced from these currently underused wood resources can enter new, emerging, or existing value chains.
Our competition on the waste wood disposal side is incineration, offering energy recovery in some cases but resulting in the formation of toxic ash and contributing to air pollution. For some heavily treated waste wood there are no competitors except for costly and highly undesirable landfilling which are largely viewed as problematic by both waste producers and waste managers.
The market is estimated to be EUR 40.9 billion for BioFlex products and EUR 13.4 billion of waste wood recycling. We have established a clear timeline for commercialization and signed a number of agreements with partners to make this plan feasible.

Pump malfunctions or breakdowns, due to unplanned maintenance or improper settings, cost millions of euros in lost revenues every year as production and logistic lines lie idle waiting for pumps to be fixed, and when they are not optimized their productivity decrease or their energy consumption go up. 

But now, DVP, a vacuum pump manufacturer, has developed the solution to these challenges through StarLink, the worldâ€™s first intelligent vacuum pump system. StarLink is a patent-pending system that uses data analytics and machine learning to identify pump malfunctions before they happen, propose actions to be taken, and automatically adjust the operation parameters if the problem relates to the setting. This will reduce pump downtime-related costs by 30%, increase their productivity by 50% and make easier the operation manager tasks.  

The combination of our deep knowledge of vacuum pumps needs with the machine learning expertise of the university of Ferrara will create the most intelligent device to improve the competitiveness of European companies.

However, current capacity planning relies heavily on manual analysis, leaving to systematic capacity over-dimensioning and unnecessary license and hardware costs.  

Over the last 5 years, we have developed GOVERNOR: a complex but intuitive capacity planning software. GOVERNOR offers a standalone solution for efficient server consolidation and optimization. Our patent-pending solution reduces the total number of servers by matching the optimal database instances for each server and by maximizing the resource efficiency. This results in database lifecycle savings of up to 50%, at equal or better performance. For large companies with significant database infrastructure, this represents savings of over â‚¬1 million per year. 

GOVERNOR already supports Microsoft SQL Server, the database brand with the largest market penetration. For the Phase 2, we will finish development of GOVERNOR with 4 strategic additional features to support faster and broader scaling of the business:  

Cloud environment planning support (covering Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services), planning support for Oracle, a GOVERNOR SaaS version and integration to market leading third-party tools.

At the same time, there is an impending risk of loosing citizensâ€™ trust in science, due to incresed amount of misinformation about science and research. Therefore, it is important to promote the key role that researchers have for the development and growth of our societies in a national and international context, and for keeping the public informed about critical challenges and scientific discoveries that have an impact on our daily lives. In Iceland, science has a crucial role to play in a society that relies to a great extent on nature and responsible use of natural resources, from renewable energy and sustainable blue growth to the societal and cultural implications of living in coastal communites. In order to ensure and facilitate interaction with the public and society at large, the project 'My Science â€“ Our Science' aims to organise European Researchers Night in Iceland with the aim to invite researchers to engage with the public to communicate their work, their passion and their findings in order to increase the awareness of research and innovation activities. The objective is to enhance a positive public perception of researchers by facilitiating an open and active dialogue between researchers and citizens of all ages, especially focusing on children and young people that could consider a research career. In addition to higlighting the importance of researchersâ€™ work, the initiative provides a rare opportunity for researchers to communicate directly with the public at all ages and even to involve citizens in the road to scientific discoveries, thus contributing to the transparency of their work and enhancing the attractiveness of scientific careers, which is instrumental in encouraging young people to embark on a career in research.'",2018-05-01,2019-12-31,175000.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1

1990,795961,ET-PHOTOX,Functionalization of ethereal C-O Bonds Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis,"The direct utilization of native functional groups without the need for prefunctionalized holds considerable promise to revolutionize organic synthesis. While significant advances have been realized within the area of C-H activation, the functionalization of inert C-O bonds in aryl ethers is still at its infancy. Prompted by the natural abundance of aryl ethers in Lignin, the second most abundant biopolymer (30% of non-fossil organic carbon on earth), chemists have been challenged to devise, conceptuality and practicality aside, mild, general and widely applicable catalytic technologies for ethereal C-O funcionalization. At present, however, these technologies remain confined to the use of rather activated extended p-systems, stoichiometric metal reagents and, in many instances, harsh conditions. ET-PHOTOX will offer an innovative and challenging approach for functionalizing aryl C-O bonds by merging nickel catalysis and photoredox catalysis via electron donor-acceptor complexation events. Such synergistic catalysis will unlock unconceivable scenarios within the C-O bond-cleavage arena, including the use of non-extended p-systems, non-organometallic based nucleophiles or even carbon dioxide as coupling partner. Therefore, this project holds potential to change concepts in catalysis, allowing new tactics to be implemented in organic synthesis from ubiquitous C-O bonds, thus enhancing the ever-growing quality of the European research. The prospective impact of ET-PHOTOX, together with the new scientific, technical training, competences and transferable skills received will position the candidate with a unique opportunity to start an independent career at a European academic institution after the execution of the project.",2018-07-01,2020-06-30,158121.6,,['biopolymer'],1,1

These materials can operate with a high thermodynamic efficiency and, showing an advantage over thermoelectric materials, they do not require bulky heat sinks to maintain the required heat difference. Hence, â€œpyroelectric energy harvestingâ€ could be the right methodology to rescue some of the enormous amount of energy wasted as heat by converting the thermal fluctuations into
electrical energy (e.g. more than 50% of the energy generated in the U.S. is lost that way each year). Reusing the wasted energy and increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption are important EU targets, expressed in the Europe 2020 Strategy. Enhancing energy efficiency solutions would help citizens both in economic (lower electricity bills) and ecological (clean, green energy) terms.
This project examines the development of pyroelectric nanotextured ceramics, for use in future ambient energy harvesting.
An original combination of an inexpensive mechano-chemical synthesis for the production of hexagonal ZnS (wurtzite)
nanopowder, and the subsequent fabrication of nanotextured ceramics applying a high-pressure-low-temperature sintering,
will be used, an approach we have explored previously to suppress grain growth. Neither the fabrication methods, nor the
existence of nanotextured pyroelectric ceramics of wurtzite have yet been reported in the literature. In particular the project
will explore the potential of the wurtzite nanotextured ceramics as new functional anisotropic bulk materials for pyroelectric
energy harvesting. We expect the pyroelectric properties to improve with the introduction of nanostructures and texturing
within the anisotropic material like wurtzite, which should ultimately lead to more efficient pyroelectric devices for energy

1992,771567,CABUM,An investigation of the mechanisms at the interaction between cavitation bubbles and contaminants,"A sudden decrease in pressure triggers the formation of vapour and gas bubbles inside a liquid medium (also called cavitation). This leads to many (key) engineering problems: material loss, noise and vibration of hydraulic machinery. On the other hand, cavitation is a potentially a useful phenomenon: the extreme conditions are increasingly used for a wide variety of applications such as surface cleaning, enhanced chemistry, and waste water treatment (bacteria eradication and virus inactivation).
Despite this significant progress a large gap persists between the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the effects of cavitation and its application. Although engineers are already commercializing devices that employ cavitation, we are still not able to answer the fundamental question: What precisely are the mechanisms how bubbles can clean, disinfect, kill bacteria and enhance chemical activity? The overall objective of the project is to understand and determine the fundamental physics of the interaction of cavitation bubbles with different contaminants. To address this issue, the CABUM project will investigate the physical background of cavitation from physical, biological and engineering perspective on three complexity scales: i) on single bubble level, ii) on organised and iii) on random bubble clusters, producing a progressive multidisciplinary synergetic effect.
The proposed synergetic approach builds on the PI's preliminary research and employs novel experimental and numerical methodologies, some of which have been developed by the PI and his research group, to explore the physics of cavitation behaviour in interaction with bacteria and viruses.
Understanding the fundamental physical background of cavitation in interaction with contaminants will have a ground-breaking implications in various scientific fields (engineering, chemistry and biology) and will, in the future, enable the exploitation of cavitation in water and soil treatment processes.",2018-07-01,2023-06-30,1904565.0,,['soil treatment'],1,1

How can we achieve that without overwhelming the planet?â€ The question, raised back in 2009, demands quick action. Human life depends on plants, which feeds us, our livestock or fulfils our biofuel needs. Thus to feed this growing population, it will be necessary to double agricultural yields without increasing the amount of arable land. A fine knowledge of the fundamental molecular processes that finely regulate plant reproduction, will allow increasing crop productivity and high quality seed production in a sustainable manner by agricultural engineering, safeguarding the increase of arable land usage.
EpiAGPs aims to provide new insights into the role of Arabinogalactan Proteins (AGPs), signalling molecules crucial for plant reproduction, and their signalling cascade, along with their modulation of/by epigenetic mechanisms. This will be achieved using a combination of genetic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis is an excellent model to study the reproductive process, as it shares a conserved developmental program with major seed-producing crop plants.
EpiAGPs has great potential to contribute to Europeâ€™s excellence and competitiveness in the world, being in line with the European Sustainable Development Program and with the Europesâ€™ 2020 Strategy goals that is optimisation of food production processes and a lower-carbon impact to achieve sustainable growth.

In the â€œMANGANOXIâ€™ project a novel and ecologically friendly approach towards the development and application of manganese-based catalytic systems is proposed. The project first focuses on the use of a known manganese complex (MnTMTACN) together with Lewis Acids and hydrogen peroxide as a stoichiometric oxidant, generated using a co-catalyst from dioxygen, in the epoxidation of alkenes. The project will then develop analogues of other ligand systems to integrate â€˜clickâ€™ generated 1,2,3-triazoles as pyridine surrogates, which should result in modular ligand systems which can be readily tuned. In addition, in order to obtain easier isolation of products and enable catalyst recycling, the most effective ligand systems will be anchored onto selected support using â€˜clickâ€™ chemistry. The use of the copper-catalysed [3\2] â€˜clickâ€™ Huisgen cycloaddition of an alkyne and azide is indispensable, as it facilitates both the anchoring of the ligand on the support and the incorporation of the pyridine surrogate into the ligand architecture. The catalytic oxidation reactions using the immobilized metal-ligand complex will then be conducted in a flow reactor, which will result in enormous potential of application in industry, by virtue of estimated high reproducibility and unrestrained scale-up of reactions.

The process is a sequence of mechanical operations implemented by a compact dedicated line and is foreseen in two versions that apply to different phases of tyres lifecycle:
REWORK: main version that applies to tyre production to rework all scraps and non-compliant components and produce rubber 100% reusable in the main production;
RECYCLE: a variant of process that applies to recovering rubber from end-of-life tyres (ELT) to produce sheeted rubber usable for moulded applications. Variants include pre-conditioning phases to clear rubber from textile cords.
The two versions are conceived to serve different customer segments, REWORK for tyre manufacturers to improve eco-efficiency and reduce production costs, RECYCLE for recyclers of ELT to produce cleaner, more usable forms of recycled rubber suitable to open new high-value application opportunities and increase ELT management profit.
In both segments business models and value chains are consolidated and needs to be served are explicit, thus creating a very favourable context for the exploitation.
The project builds on a solid technological and business background. ELSY is the global leader of specialised machines and control systems for tyre and plastic industries.

The total Al in use is expected to increase from 600 million tonnes in 2013 to one billion tonnes by 2020, thus creating a large metal bank for future recycling use.  Currently primary Al production from bauxite ore is the primary source of Al metal supply to industry. Since primary aluminium production is an energy intensive process and the world's bauxite deposits are limited, the use of Al scrap accumulated from packaging, building, automotive and engineering sectors offers a sustainable solution to secure metal supply. However, the scrap from these sectors has higher levels impurities in particular with iron (Fe). Higher concentration of Fe is detrimental to the mechanical properties due to formation of harmful platelet structures of Fe-based intermetallics.

So far, unlike high voltage transmission system operators (TSOs), it has not been essential for DSOs to monitor their grids because of the unidirectional power flows and the over-sizing of these grids infrastructures that have allowed to operate them in a safe way. By the increase of DERs and without monitoring systems, it is difficult for DSOs to ensure the reliability and the quality of services while maintaining a limited cost for the grid infrastructure investments. A Smart Electricity Grid is an upgraded active electricity network including information and communication technologies, advanced control, IoT, etc. It can intelligently integrate the actions of â€˜prosumersâ€™ able to produce electricity as well as consume it. A smart grid ensures an efficient, sustainable electricity supply, with lower losses and greater reliability and security and solves the main problems associated with the integration onto the conventional distribution network of a great deal of variable and/or intermittent DERs.

UDO has been tested in two vehiclesâ€™ prototypes, one of a kick-bike and another of a bicycle, and has proven its very low energy consumption (1 Wh/km), big autonomy (up to 120 km) and usability.
54% of the worldsâ€™ population lives in cities and almost half commute to work by car, generating 40% of CO2 emissions. Car userâ€™s experience is far from being efficient as up to 101 hours in congestion can be wasted and â‚¬ 10.000/year in costs can be spent. Commuting by bike is a great way to avoid traffic jam, contributes to a healthier city, increases the appeal of public transport and save money whilst exercising. However, current offerings (traditional and electric vehicles) presents drawbacks that still prevent commuters to switch. Nowadays solutions for citiesâ€™ sustainable mobility are bicycles (but the physical effort required and the need to shower afterwards still prevents many commuters) and electric bicycles (discouraged by many users as they feel dangerous, are heavy and have low autonomy as they must be charged every 15-40 km). As such, there is currently a gap between potential urban cyclists and the vehicle offering. UDO is the alternative that fill the gap for commuters to shift towards a healthier, more sustainable and safer way to travel to work.
The goal of UDOâ€™s project is to bring our vehicles to a state of serial production and international commercialization.

While remaining a critical operational bottleneck in several industries, incremental innovation has set the tone of technical developments in this field â€“ with drum filters remaining the inefficient yet undisputed forefront standard in the industry.

 JetConveyor represents a disruptive innovation against the current state-of-the-art in industrial air filtering technologies, providing a sizeable set of advantages against alternative methods, including: (1) 24/7 operation with minimum maintenance requirements; (2) significant reduction of health occupational hazards; (3) virtually risk free against system breakdown (no moving parts); (4) significant energy savings against clogged filters; (5) it enables improved recycling of process byproducts, enabling its direct reutilization in the manufacturing process. In addition, and provided that JetConveyorâ€™s draws its advantages from an innovative system design rather than specific filter components, overall system costs remain directly in-line with conventional alternatives in the market. 

To bridge the remaining steps towards full scale commercialization of JetConveyor, MultiAir will leverage from the current SME instrument application as a vital stepping stone to prepare the companyâ€™s business strategy, enabling also to secure IPR prior to engaging with showcasing activities to enroll early adopters of the technology.

The new solution will not only analyse homogeneous biomass, like woodchips, but various types of biomass and from different origins. Mantex will sell to the European bioenergy industry.

Mantex will address one of the key challenges in growing the use of biomass today: the difficulty in obtaining reliable quality measures. The quality of biomass varies greatly as different kinds of biomass and lots have different compositions. However, state-of-the-art measuring technologies are not appropriate for effective decision-making, because they lack accuracy and reliability and have long timing delay for use in the dynamics of boiler control.

Manex will build and test a full scale demonstrator at a trial customer (WP4 and WP5). The demonstrator will be installed at a large-scale bioenergy plant and analyze the biomass on a moving conveyor belt in realtime determining the most important key parameters (i.e. moisture content, calorific value, ash content and unwanted items) to high precision (WP5). Mantex will then attempt to categorise biomass effectively into classes that a bioenergy producer can separate. 

With this solution, for the first time, accurate knowledge of biofuel quality will be available in real time. This makes it possible to (1) make significant efficiency gains in boiler operations at bioenergy plants (2) establish categories of various biomass types according to an incineration rather than a species perspective (3) make sourcing and the trade of biomass more efficient.

Essential information related to the health and environmental impacts of GFN is either missing or remains incomplete. Specifically, to perform the appropriate nano-risk assessment, there is an urgent need to adapt the environmental risk asÂ¬sessment principles and methodology related to the exposure as well as the hazard assessment. ToxEcoGraphene will address the pressing need to identify the environmental processes that will determine the fate of GFN in the environment, as well as their nanoecotoxicity impacts. The research objectives (RO) of ToxEcoGraphene are: (1) To develop, characterize and utilize well-defined GFN-oriented protocols and methods to facilitate investigation of GFN fate and transport in natural complex media, (2) To determine the effect and evaluate GFN toxicity to biofilms, by focusing on environmental fate processes, mainly on hetero-aggregation and growth of the â€œeco-coronaâ€ on grapheneâ€™s surface, and (3) To implement the main research conclusions in order to mitigate identified risks/environmental impact and design-out potential drawbacks/hazards related to GFN technology and
applications â€“ i.e., safe-by-design rules for GFN tailored to a range of application areas. Given the economic importance, the relevance of the research is clear.",2018-05-01,2020-04-30,195454.8,,['recycling'],1,1

2008,743569,AFRI-SKYFOR,"African Sky Forests: services, threats and management recommendations","Tropical montane forests (TMF) are biodiversity rich and unique ecosystems which provide water to tens of millions of people, among other services such as firewood, medicinal plants, hazard prevention, climate modulation and carbon sequestration. However, TMF remains understudied and over-exploited, particularly in Africa. Predicted climatic changes and trends in population growth will negatively affect the ecological functioning and ecosystem service delivery of these already fragile ecosystems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand these ecosystems and use that information to inform management.
AFRI-SKYFOR, focused on TMF in Africa, will provide new information key for understanding and improving the management of these ecosystems. I will combine data on multiple ecosystem services (e.g. water, medicinal plants, carbon), ecosystem threat, environmental and socio-economic data, modelling and novel state-of-the-art methodologies (such as socio-ecological ecosystem modelling using Bayesian statistics) from the fields of ecology, conservation science and ecosystem valuation to (1) identify and prioritize the ecosystem services generated by African TMF; (2) assess current and future threat presence and severity to these ecosystems; (3) create a model of the socio-ecological functioning of African TMF and simulate potential future scenarios; and (4) develop management recommendations for future sustainability.
AFRI-SKYFOR is a highly interdisciplinary project which will generate information of wide relevance for the sustainable use of natural resources in African mountains. The high scientific quality and applicability proposed will benefit the EU not only by generating new knowledge and publications in high-profile scientific journals which will contribute to the enhancement of EU scientific excellence, but also by contributing to EU commitments within International treaties such as the Aichi Biodiversity targets and the Sustainable Development Goals",2017-08-01,2020-07-31,251857.8,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

By incorporating UCNPs and dyes, I aim to efficiently develop a series of organic and inorganic hybrid nanoprobes. The fluctuations in the concentration of disease-related biomarkers can be monitored by fluorescence and photoacoustic signals simultaneously. Furthermore, this strategy can be easily expanded to detect different biomarkers by tuning and modifying the UCNPs and organic dyes pairs.

2011,797150,MELANCHOR,Understanding the Role of Motors in Subcellular Mechanics of Organelles by Controlling Myo6-Cargo Interactions in situ,"Mechanical forces play crucial roles in the formation and maturation of many organelles and membrane vesicles. Many of these forces originate in the action of cytoskeletal motors, but how these motors are activated and how their mechanical functions are regulated in the cell are poorly understood. Rather than being â€œalways onâ€ machines, motors must often be specifically activated for distinct mechanical roles by partners.

The MELANCHOR project seeks to uncover how Myosin VI (Myo6) promotes two cell processes through specific interaction with partners that promote different Myo6 dimerisation modes with unique mechanical properties. Myo6:GIPC1 complexes aid in endosomal trafficking through the actin cortex while Myo6:Optineurin complexes  promote melanosome biogenesis through a membrane recycling pathway. 

Two complementary approaches will uncover the functions of Myo6. (1) Optogenetic tools will control Myo6 targeting to endosomes or melanosomes in live cells, with simultaneous functional imaging, to precisely localize the effect of Myo6 in space and time. (2) Novel in vitro motility methods will determine the effect of different Myo6 partners on Myo6 activation and mechanics under tension. Finally, a combined approach will address the mechanical role of Myo6 in these organellesâ€“ whether it is a tension-bearing anchor, transporter or weak tether.

The MELANCHOR project raises the exciting prospect of using optogenetic tools to provide real-time information on subcellular mechanics. By integrating cellular and in vitro approaches to measure the tension in individual Myo6 motors, an unprecedented level of detail on the cellular function of motors will be made possible. These novel techniques will help shed light on motor function in processes such as intracellular trafficking, cell migration, and cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis.",2018-04-01,2020-03-31,185076.0,,['recycling'],1,1
2012,795347,UGMNanoSens,Black phosphorous quantum dots as fluorescent nanosensing platforms for detecting unauthorised genetically modified material,"The discovery of traces of unapproved genetically modified material in imports arriving to the European Union (EU) has set the alarms on for the European authorities, leading them to reinforce their monitoring procedures. The EU has a â€˜zero tolerance policyâ€™ for virtually all unauthorised genetically modified organisms (UGM), prohibiting them to be placed on the EU market even if they have been authorised in third countries. UGM monitoring is carried out in a limited number of enforcement laboratories through highly specialised technologies, mostly based on the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The development of faster, simpler and more cost-efficient analytical systems for UGM testing is greatly encouraged by law-enforcing authorities. The increasing number of functional nanomaterials with interesting properties and exhibiting specific biomolecule interactions, e.g. DNA-graphene, has brought a wide range of opportunities to the field of DNA detection. The interest in nanomaterial-based fluorescent sensors for nucleic acid detection has been growing due to their ease of operation and high sensitivity. In this sense, the use of nanomaterials as fluorophores or quenchers has been especially sought in recent years as they have tunable optical properties and can improve the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to conventional molecular systems. Monolayer black phosphorus (BP), being an important member of the 2D-materials family, has triggered a recent resurgence of interest owing to its unique structure as well as fascinating optical and electronic properties and, most recently, BP Quantum Dots (BPQDs) have shown promising potential in a wide range of applications, some of them yet to be explored. This proposal is aimed at evaluating the use of this emergent material (BPQDs) as fluorescent-based nanoplatforms to make up a rapid and simple DNA-sensing system for monitoring unauthorised genetically modified material (â€œUGMNanoSensâ€).",2018-05-01,2020-04-30,142720.8,,['nanomaterial'],1,1
2013,795369,FUNDra,Remote sensing to model spatiotemporal distribution of functional diversity in the tundra,"Functional diversity (FD) among species in ecosystems allows these systems to function optimally and provide essential services for society, e.g. carbon sequestration and water filtration. FD determines the ecosystemâ€™s resilience to environmental change and provides resilience to abrupt disturbances.  Although the importance of FD is now recognized, its divers across spatial and temporal scales are not yet clear. This lack of knowledge is enhanced by the difficulty to infer FD from communities that cannot be realistically sampled, such as most tundra ecosystems. Temporal dynamics of FD is rarely investigated but would give useful insights into how ecosystem functioning responds to change. The overall objectives of the project are: 1) determine FD across sampling locations and time periods based on environmental and remote sensing data, and 2) determine which edaphic and climatic factors are the main drivers of FD distribution. To accomplish these I will use remotely sensed data from state of the art technologies, i.e. hyperspectral vegetation signatures, vegetation structure, time series of satellite earth observation, and environmental data, incorporating them into a distribution modelling framework. Models will be calibrated and validated using detailed plot-level data. This research will produce current spatial distribution of FD in the tundra, environmental drivers of FD distribution, the temporal dynamics of FD distribution, and the temporal dynamics of FD for different vegetation types. Generated data will be made freely available through multiple portals. Social media, press releases, and a popular science article will communicate the research to a broader audience. The high quality training for this research; the multitude of networking opportunities through collaboration, dissemination, and communication activities; and the hands-on training for project management, will restart my career after a break and advance me toward becoming a senior researcher.",2018-11-01,2020-10-31,177598.8,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

Organic semiconductors offer several unique advantages over inorganic materials, such as solution processable, flexibility and biocompatibility, thus development of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) will enable applications not currently feasible with traditional inorganic thermoelectrics (ITEs). Preliminary results showed that the thermoelectric performance of two organic semiconductors can be significantly improved through an evaporation doping methodology as well as incorporation of nanomaterials such as black Phosphorus (BP). Although the breakthroughs are promising, the charge transport mechanism is still unclear. Without such an understanding, the OTE systems can never be optimised. It is the objective of the proposed project (i) to understand charge transport in the semiconductors and their nanocomposites by integrating experimental output into charge transport model, (ii) to optimise their thermoelectric performance based on understanding of the charge transport mechanism, (iii) to fabricate the a hybrid OTE system with optimised thermoelectric performance (i.e. P > 1250 Î¼Wm-1K-2, Îº<0.5 Wm-1K-1, and ZTâ‰¥1), and (iv) to fabricate a prototype hybrid OTE generator and demonstrate its application as a flexible solar thermoelectric generator and/or wearable thermoelectric generator for electronic-skin.",2018-07-01,2020-06-30,171792.6,,['renewable energy'],1,1

This project is fully aligned with the European primary goals for the promotion of a â€œgreenâ€ society, with a sustainable and resource efficient economy, by key actions such as the development of new and improved materials with reduced environmental impact, from sourcing and processing to end of life. 
Cellulose is an abundant, renewable and sustainable biopolymer, plus it is biodegradable. Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), obtained with top-down approaches from cellulose sources, forms excellent gas barrier films ; however, their high hydrophilicity prevents their use in highly humid environments. It is therefore convenient to combine MFC with polymers in the form of composites. Crosslinked matrices guarantee high mechanical performances and water and solvent resistance. The uncured prepolymers can have very low viscosity, which allows for solvent-free mixing at room temperature. However curing often hinders recyclability. Reversible photocrosslinking of bio-based prepolymers, combined with MFC to obtain recyclable composites is innovative. 
To fulfil the final goal of the project, I will use MFC obtained from hemp hurd, a low cost by-product of industrial hemp decortication process, and a bio-based prepolymer, functionalized with a reversibly photocrosslinkable group, able to ensure the curing of the polymeric matrix upon irradiation at a given wavelength, and to allow its dismantling upon irradiation at a different wavelength. Thus, through appropriate matrix-filler combination and processing, I plan to obtain a reversibly photocrosslinked composite material having the performances requested for packaging, the recyclability of thermoplastics and potentially the biodegradability of natural polymers.",2018-08-01,2020-07-31,180277.2,,['biopolymer'],1,1

2017,794264,TROPHY,The consequences of temperature-resource interactions for the future of marine phytoplankton communities,"Temperature, nutrients and light drive the growth of phytoplankton, aquatic photosynthetic microbes responsible for nearly half of global primary production. Because phytoplankton influence global biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration and climate, accurately modelling their growth is vital to forecasting our future. However, the models we use for global ecosystem forecasts do not consider how these factors interact, even though the interactions lead to qualitative and quantitative differences in outcomes. My goal is to therefore build a mechanistic understanding of how temperature and resources interact to influence phytoplankton growth, productivity and biogeochemical cycles.


This project has three objectives (i) develop statistical models describing how phytoplankton growth changes as a joint function of temperature, nutrients and light, (ii) develop mechanistic models characterising how temperature and resources influence cellular processes in phytoplankton, and ultimately their growth, and (iii) implement dynamic versions of the mechanistic model to forecast how marine phytoplankton communities will respond to future changes in temperature, resources and predation.

My work will involve applying machine learning techniques to published laboratory and field datasets to understand complex interactions between the three factors. By combining this understanding with insights from ecological theory, I will generate an accurate mechanistic model of growth, and then test the power of this model to predict patterns in the ocean using independent field datasets. Finally, I will use the validated mechanistic model to forecast changes to global patterns in phytoplankton growth and primary productivity. 

This project will enable us to generate credible forecasts of phytoplankton productivity and biogeochemical cycles in a warming ocean, and improve our understanding of fundamental ecological processes by uniting major fields of ecological theory.",2018-04-01,2020-03-31,212194.8,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

Cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis is critical for life, with mutations in genes required for cytotoxicity causative of severe, early-onset hyperinflammatory syndromes. Genetic studies have identified several cytosolic proteins required for CL exocytosis. However, understanding of how these proteins cooperate for exocytosis, their interaction partners and how their activities are regulated is still limited. I propose strategies to gain insight to the molecular regulation of human CL exocytosis. First, prompted by genetic studies, I aim to study the contribution of two distinct Munc13-4 isoforms to lymphocyte cytotoxicity by dissecting their role in cytotoxic granule (CG) exocytosis using advanced live-cell imaging as well as identifying their interaction partners using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). Second, recycling endosome (RE) have recently been implicated in CG exocytosis, delivering syntaxin-11, an effector molecule required for CG fusion, to the plasma membrane. I plan to use a high-throughput MS approach to identify RE constituents and cargo in order to define new components that may be critical for CG exocytosis. Results will provide novel mechanistic insights to CL exocytosis, which will also be relevant for other exocytic systems. Providing detailed molecular understanding of lymphocyte cytotoxicity in both healthy and pathological conditions, insights promise to guide improved diagnosis and therapy of immune disorders associated with defects in lymphocyte cytotoxicity.

2020,793643,MFCPF,Multifunctional cellulose photonic films,"The most brilliant colours in nature are obtained without using any pigments, only by nano-structural materials. Such colour effects are found in many plants where colour can be obtained using only cellulose. We aim to produce bio-mimetic materials with multiple optical functionalities, by taking the inspiration from nature and by optimising the properties of the cellulose itself. A challenge in cellulose-based photonic materials is the intrinsic brittleness of the final films. The proposed research aims to modify the properties of the cellulose building block and design their properties and structures to finely tune the optical and mechanical properties of the produced films. Novel nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) such as electrosterically (ENCC) and sterically (SNCC) stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose will be exploited to this propose. The unique charge and hairy morphology of ENCC and SNCC will allow to finely tune their interaction and therefore to tailor the properties of the composites films. The high charge density of ENCC allows obtaining stable colloidal suspensions even after conjugating them with plasmonic nanoparticles or fluorescent molecules. Therefore composite films made from them are expected to reveal complex optical response. Finally by exploiting the fluorescent-ENCC as a labeling nanoparticles in the films, will allow to investigate the self-assembly process by detecting their fluorescent signal during the film assembly. This research will develop a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the self-assembly of biopolymer-based nanoparticles and to fabricate smart materials with on-demand optical and mechanical response, and will pave the way to the use of natural materials as novel pigments or for optical interfaces and sensors required in biomedical applications.",2018-08-01,2020-07-31,183454.8,,['biopolymer'],1,1

However, conventional reactors, such as packed beds and slurry reactors, typically suffer from resilient mass/heat transfer limitations due to their low specific interface areas, long mixing times, and a reduced accessibility of the gas reactants to the catalyst surface. To overcome these limitations, continuous flow microreactors and catalytic membrane reactors have been considered for increasing the G/L interface area, but these systems require complex equipment and still do not guarantee an efficient L/S contact at the catalyst surface. For a major improvement on current systems in terms of cost efficiency and energy savings, G/L/S reactors operating at the nanoscale are required.
The aim of this ERC project is to design robust particle-stabilized G/L dispersions (i.e. micro/nano-bubbles and liquid marbles) as highly efficient G/L/S nanoreactors for conducting catalytic reactions at mild conditions.

We will (i) prepare NPs with defined sizes, shapes, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), including catalytic functions; (ii) generate particle-stabilized bubbles and liquid marbles affording highly active and selective reactions at the G/L/S interface with NP recycling after each catalytic cycle using external stimuli; examine the interplay between the NP assembly at the G/L interface and the catalytic properties along the reaction by combining well-designed experiments with simulations; and (iv) reengineer G/L/S multiphasic reactors using our particle-stabilized nanoreactors to achieve a high catalytic performance at milder operation conditions compared to conventional reactors while keeping a high degree of stability and flexibility at reduced layouts.

Optical response of strongly interacting dipolar emitters is important in systems ranging from naturally occurring photosynthesis complexes and dye molecule aggregates, to metamaterials in new solar cell and atomic clock designs. Cooperative regime offers potential for strong, collectively enhanced single-photon coupling and nonlinearities, promising new platforms for optical control at a single photon level, precision measurements and quantum simulations. However there is yet no existing methodology for understanding optical response of this complex, many-body systems.

Recent progress in control of cold atom ensembles on length scales shorter than the wavelength of the field mediating interaction promises new simple and controllable platform to explore cooperative regime. This action will use unique combination of two complementary cold atom experiments in this regime. The first one achieves small, dense atomic samples; the second provides direct control and measurement of positions and states of individual atoms, together with real-time control of their external and internal degrees of freedom.

The applicant will extend this two experiments to explore new control schemes and access new observables. These will be used in benchmarking of knowledge about the cooperative regime, guiding development of new theoretical methods. Applicantâ€™s combination of experimental and theoretical experience in analysis of complex atom-light interactions will be used for high performance computing numerical simulations.

2023,804554,PanePowerSW,Transparent Solar Panel Technology for Energy Autonomous Greenhouses and Glass Buildings,"According to United Nations, the world population will reach to 9.7 billion by 2050. Food, energy and water are three critical resources that must be managed if mankind is going to thrive. With these figures, we will need a 70-100% increase of food supply to maintain the current nutrition levels. Greenhouse farming is a solution to the food worldwide demands as it increases the food production per acre up to 100% compared to open field agriculture. However, Greenhouse farming also implies both strong energy cost and gas emission. Indeed, agriculture production accounts for 14% of global energy demand and, in 2004, for 13.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
On top of that, the world primary energy demand could increase by 50% by the middle of the century. Nowadays, buildings account for nearly 40% of the total energy consumption globally but it is estimated that potential energy savings in buildings could reach between 20% and 40% with new solutions. Solar panels enable energy savings; typically installed on the roof, but they do not offer versatility for other type of application, such as windows to allow the entrance of the light inside buildings or greenhouses.
Our company has developed PanePower Solar Window (SW). PanePowerSW is a unique transparent (up to 70%) solar panel glass that generates clean energy through PV technology and more importantly allows the light to shine through greenhouses and commercial buildings windows. PanePowerSW contributes to the energy savings in buildings up to 30%, while in greenhouses, it enables the growing of the crop while reducing energy costs, quantified in 25% of the total operational costs.

2025,771850,APOGEE,Atomic-scale physics of single-photon sources.,"Single-photon sources (SPSs) are systems capable of emitting photons one by one. These sources are of major importance for quantum-information science and applications. SPSs experiments generally rely on the optical excitation of two level systems of atomic-scale dimensions (single-molecules, vacancies in diamondâ€¦). Many fundamental questions related to the nature of these sources and the impact of their environment remain to be explored:

Can SPSs be addressed with atomic-scale spatial accuracy? How do the nanometer-scale distance or the orientation between two (or more) SPSs affect their emission properties? Does coherence emerge from the proximity between the sources? Do these structures still behave as SPSs or do they lead to the emission of correlated photons? How can we then control the degree of entanglement between the sources? Can we remotely excite the emission of these sources by using molecular chains as charge-carrying wires? Can we couple SPSs embodied in one or two-dimensional arrays? How does mechanical stress or localised plasmons affect the properties of an electrically-driven SPS?

Answering these questions requires probing, manipulating and exciting SPSs with an atomic-scale precision. This is beyond what is attainable with an all-optical method. Since they can be confined to atomic-scale pathways we propose to use electrons rather than photons to excite the SPSs. This unconventional approach provides a direct access to the atomic-scale physics of SPSs and is relevant for the implementation of these sources in hybrid devices combining electronic and photonic components. To this end, a scanning probe microscope will be developed that provides simultaneous spatial, chemical, spectral, and temporal resolutions.

This is demonstrated by its profound involvement in many aspects of everyday life: from powering portable electronic devices to personal electro-mobility, passing through recycling, waste water treatment, clean energy production, water desalination, personal care, and others. It appears that we have reached the limits of the technological development and no further revolutionary progresses can be achieved without a deeper understanding of the electron- and ion-transfer process at the interface. The objective of this proposal is to achieve a phenomenological modeling of the electron- and ion-transfer processes, by extending the Marcus-Hush theory of the electron transfer to a general kinetic equation based on experimental data. The extended kinetic equation should include and clarify the role of the excess free Gibbs energy on the kinetics of electron- and ion-transfer, as well as the role of the double layer charge (Frumkin effect). A unified theory of charge transfer and transport will be proposed in the frame of the phenomenological theory of transport and of classic and extended irreversible thermodynamics. Since the investigated phenomena are complex and inter-linked, the investigation techniques must seize snapshots of the system during its evolution; this will be done by hyphenating the electrochemical techniques with quartz crystal microbalance, able to measure in real time nanogram mass changes. In order to cover the time-scales necessary to develop the phenomenological theory, we will measure dynamic impedance and differential immitance spectra with a dynamic multi-frequency approach. This is based on perturbing the system with a multi-sine signal and extracting the linear and non-linear current response and mass change. The evaluation of the phenomenological parameters will rely on novel analysis algorithms and on precise modeling of the interface.",2018-05-01,2023-04-30,1943600.0,,['recycling'],1,1
2027,795179,CROSSGRASS,"Cross-border analysis of grassland greenness in Asia: Climate variations, grazing pressure, and land policy change","The Asian grasslands that stretch from the Eastern shores of the Caspian Sea to Manchuria in China are the largest continuous grassland biome worldwide and play a vital role in global carbon sequestration and in sustaining biodiversity. In recent decades, the integrity of the Asian grasslands became threatened by climate change and increasing land-use intensity, which in turn jeopardize the livelihoods of millions of residents that rely on the grassland resources for feeding their animals. To date, however, the spatial and temporal patterns of the changes in grassland resources across the region have not been systematically assessed. Moreover, it remains elusive how changing grazing intensity, climate variations, and institutional transformations have affected the grassland dynamics. This project aims to fill this gap by mapping the spatial patterns of vegetation changes across the Asian grassland biome for the past three and a half decades, and by quantifying the drivers of these changes. The dynamics of grassland greenness, as a proxy of plant growth, will be assessed using vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data. The changes in grassland greenness will then be statistically associated with climate data, subnational livestock statistics, and other control variables using spatial econometric panel analysis at fine spatial grain and annual temporal resolution. Combined, these analyses will shed light on the importance of climate variations and land-use intensity across institutional boundaries. Such insights are pertinent for deriving management options and policy solutions that simultaneously reduce grassland degradation and secure rural livelihoods in Asia. Besides the scientific goals, this action will provide a platform for the applicant and the host to share and transfer their knowledge and experiences in interdisciplinary research in human-environmental systems.",2018-04-01,2020-03-31,159460.8,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1

Although an impressive range of C-H functionalizations can be achieved with small transition metal complexes, site selectivity is often determined by features of the substrate, and not by the catalyst. A general approach to achieve the more aspirational â€˜catalyst controlledâ€™ transformations requires molecular recognition elements within the catalyst which: a) allow precise substrate orientation and b) can be tuned to alter selectivity. In principle, these requirements could be perfectly addressed by protein catalysts which can be readily adapted via laboratory evolution. However, enzyme engineering strategies are currently limited to Natureâ€™s twenty amino acid alphabet, severely limiting the range of metal co-ordination environments, and thus catalytic activities, that are accessible within proteins. 
In enzC-Hem, I will exploit advanced protein engineering technology available in my laboratory to install â€˜chemically programmedâ€™ ligands and/or noble metal co-factors into selected enzyme scaffolds. I will show that the resulting C-H activation catalysts can be systematically optimized via directed evolution with an expanded genetic code using modern ultra-high throughput methods (>100 variants per second), yielding biocatalysts with augmented selectivity/activity profiles. Thus my approach merges the broad range of C-H functionalizations accessible with small molecule catalysts with precise control of selectivity provided by proteins. The biocatalysts developed will address major global challenges in biotechnology and synthetic chemistry, from enhancing lignocellulose derived biofuel production to revealing novel bioactive molecules via late-stage functionalizations.",2018-01-01,2022-12-31,1492424.0,,['biofuel'],1,1

Inspired by this paradigm, SOLARX will explore new strategies for photon management in solar energy harvesting, based on the transfer and manipulation of excitons at hybrid interfaces. At the core of SOLARX is our development of a new femtosecond transient absorption imaging technique with sub-10fs time resolution and sub-diffraction limit spatial resolution. This opens completely new possibilities to explore excitonic physics at the nanoscale, directly visualising not just the motion of excitons but understanding how vibronic coupling and local structure affects their dynamics. Building on this platform we will deliver ground-breaking new insights into excitonic process in and at the interfaces between organic semiconductors, quantum dots, 2D monolayer semiconductors and lanthanide doped nanoparticles. We will elucidate the fundamental nanoscale dynamics of: (1) endothermic singlet fission, (2) the injection of triplet excitons into lanthanide doped nanoparticles and (3) the motion of excitons in 2D monolayer semiconductors and how these excitons can be funnelled over Âµm length scales to be transferred to quantum dots. We will then use these insights to develop proof of concept demonstrations of structures which harvest photons across the visible and NIR, efficiently converting high energy visible photons to two NIR photons and then concentrating these photons within structures with the potential to achieve concentration factors well above 100, thus concentrating light to drastically reduce the number of PV panels and hence dramatically reducing the cost of solar energy. SOLARX will thus explore and elucidate fundamental new excitonic physics and use these insights to bring a paradigm shift to solar energy harvesting technologies.",2018-04-01,2023-03-31,1499585.0,,['PV'],1,1

As a consequence of increasing temperature and atmospheric CO2, forest growth and subsequently carbon sequestration may be strongly affected. It is thus crucial to understand and predict the consequences of climate change on these ecosystems. Stable isotope analysis of tree rings represents a versatile archive where the effects of environmental changes are recorded. The main goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding of Î´13C and Î´18O in tree rings that can be used to infer the response of forests to climate change. The goal is achieved by a detailed analysis of the incorporation and fractionation of isotopes in trees using four novel methods: (1) We will measure compound-specific Î´13C and Î´18O of leaf sugars and (2) combine these with intra-annual Î´13C and Î´18O analysis of tree rings. The approaches are enabled by methodological developments made by me and ISOBOREAL collaborators (Rinne et al. 2012, Lehmann et al. 2016, Loader et al. in prep.). Our aim is to determine Î´13C and Î´18O dynamics of individual sugars in response to climatic and physiological factors, and to define how these signals are altered before being stored in tree rings. The improved mechanistic understanding will be applied on tree ring isotope chronologies to infer the response of the studied forests to climate change. (3) The fact that Î´18O in tree rings is a mixture of source and leaf water signals is a major problem for its application on climate studies. To solve this we aim to separate the two signals using position-specific Î´18O analysis on tree ring cellulose for the first time, which we will achieve by developing novel methods. (4) We will for the first time link the climate signal both in leaf sugars and annual rings with measured ecosystem exchange of greenhouse gases CO2 and H2O using eddy-covariance techniques.",2018-01-01,2022-12-31,1814610.0,,['carbon sequestration'],1,1
2031,759696,TOP,Towards the Bottom of the Periodic Table,"Actinide and lanthanide chemistry is currently experiencing a renaissance, due to the prospects of obtaining novel materials relevant for applications in chemical synthesis, electronics, materials science, nanotechnology, biology and medicine. Most of the fascinating properties of the lanthanide and actinide materials are related to the partially filled 4f/5f valence shell and in contrast to the rest of the periodic table, are poorly understood.  This includes the surprising reactivity, magnetic and crystal structure properties and, the rather unpredictable, covalent or ionic nature of their bonds. It is now possible to study the chemistry of the f-block elements using state-of-the-art techniques that were not available before. Two new synchrotron-based techniques, high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS), can now provide unprecedented detailed information on processes such as the electron-electron interactions, hybridization between molecular orbitals, the nature of their chemical bonding, and the occupation and the degree of the f-electron localization. Therefore, I propose to apply these cutting-edge techniques to advance the fundamental understanding of the lanthanide and actinide nanoparticles, an outstanding problem in materials science, chemistry and environmental science technology. The research will be conducted at the European Synchrotron (ESRF), at the Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL) dedicated to actinide science, where we recently installed a novel X-ray emission spectrometer with ground-breaking detection limits.

Recently emerged organic-inorganic perovskites, offer to harvest light at cost effective price. Perovskites hold merits to the existing materials, however, a fundamental challenge for high performance devices is to optimize the crystals for maximize charge carrier generation and minimize recombination losses. Their widespread use is, however, limited by insufficient stability, scalability and reproducibility. We have recently developed new concepts to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite solar cells at lab scale that are potentially up-scalable to industrial production. MOLEMAT will accomplish this by, pioneering innovative methods and will demonstrate that molecularly engineered materials enable the tuning of the charge transport and interface. Our interdisciplinary approach, combining materials science, chemistry, device physics and engineering, will not only lead to improvements in the performance and stability of perovskite solar cell beyond 24% at lab scale, but will also provide deep insights in the functioning of solar cells. The success of MOLEMAT will rapidly advance the field by enabling reproducible and stable performance adding a significant value with respect to current state of the art. However, for making it marketable product, several developments are required and the MOLEMAT targets will provide relevant answers to three key limitations: encapsulation, stability and cost competitive materials. MOLEMAT envisages the development of 30Ã—30 cm2 modules, with a power conversion efficiency of c.a 18% and a lifetime of 10\ years.

The 4.0 Industry is an environment where there are more and more vehicles without drivers, robots and machines it is necessary that people can share the place in a safe and healthy way. Therefore, the 4.0 Industry needs more security, which can be provided by our innovative approach. 
Today, the main technological challenge our customers face is to design a protection and positioning system that is precise, reliable, adaptable, low-cost and low intrusive. CLAITEC is driven to answer these needs, overcoming technical limitations that RFID systems has After 3 years of development, we characterised our own IR-Ultra-Wide Band technology including distance calculation algorithms to use as the basis of the products in development.

CP are versatile materials that can be synthesized in different shapes and morphologies, offering a wide range of application in biosensing, implants, drug delivery and tissue engineering. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) have become promising advanced materials and gained increasing importance for applications in nanomedicine, such as diagnosis, disease treatment, imaging, and tissue engineering. CNTs can interact with cells, cross the biological barriers, and modify their functions and biology. More recently, CNTs have become a new tool to specifically interact with the central nervous systems and support tissue repair after brain damage. Take into account of such findings, we hypothesize that CNTs exert functional effects on networks of cardiac myocytes and, in addition, the combination of those two materials will generate an outstanding scaffold for other electroactive cell growth, such as cardiac cells. In my current research, I have developed 3D scaffolds of CNT with a CP skeleton (polypyrrole or PEDOT) and aftewards, the goal of my research and thus the aim of the current proposal is to test such scaffolds for cardiac tissue regeneration.

In the nucleus, preferred positions are observed from chromosomes to single genes, in relation to normal and pathological cellular states. Evidence indicates a complex spatio-temporal coupling between co-regulated genes: e.g. certain genes cluster spatially when responding to similar factors and transcriptional noise patterns suggest domain-wide mechanisms. Yet, no individual experiment allows probing transcriptional coordination in 4 dimensions (FISH, live locus tracking, Hi-C...). Interpreting such data also critically requires theory (stochastic processes, statistical physicsâ€¦). A lack of appropriate experimental/analytical approaches is impairing our understanding of the 4D genome.

Our proposal combines cutting-edge single-molecule imaging, signal-theory data analysis and physical modeling to study how genes coordinate in space and time in a single nucleus. Our objectives are to understand (a) competition/recycling of shared resources between genes within subnuclear compartments, (b) how enhancers communicate with genes domain-wide, and (c) the role of local conformational dynamics and supercoiling in gene co-regulation. Our organizing hypothesis is that, by acting on their microenvironment, genes shape their co-expression with other genes.

Building upon my expertise, we will use dual-color MS2/PP7 RNA labeling to visualize for the first time transcription and motion of pairs of hormone-responsive genes in real time. With our innovative signal analysis tools, we will extract spatio-temporal signatures of underlying processes, which we will investigate with stochastic modeling and validate through experimental perturbations.

Unlike graphene, they possess an electronic band gap, enabling electrostatic confinement of electrons by using local gate electrodes, and therefore the creation of quantum dots (QD). QDs can be employed as the bases for spin qubits, possible building blocks of solid state quantum computers. Recent results of the host suggest that PTMCs may surpass other gapped 2D crystals in electron mobility, making possible the fabrication of QDs of exceptional quality. Moreover, their near-direct band gap enables their use in photovoltaic, photodetection and LED applications, and opens the way for interfacing photons with spin qubits, essential in long-distance communication between quantum computers. The proposed objectives entail the realization of electrostatic confinement to study state of the art PTMC QDs, and testing their viability as spin qubits via magnetoconductance measurements, and also the investigation of the electro-optical response of 2D heterostructures to address single photon to electron conversion in QDs, and possibilities towards application in communication, sensing and solar power conversion.

In addition, the seedling physiological responses (photosynthesis and respiration) to varying growing conditions are key to forecast the future composition of temperate forests in Europe. Younger stages of a treeâ€™s life cycle are more sensitive to climate variations than the adult stage. Recent studies demonstrate the important role of transgenerational epigenetic effects for the adaptive capacity of a tree. Although the epigenetic control of gene expression during drought has been shown in trees at the molecular level, little is known at the physiological level. In this context, the overall objectives of this study are to quantify radial growth of Scots pine and oak along a latitudinal gradient from southern France to northern Germany with particular focus on the effects of extreme events, and to quantify the potential role of epigenetic effects on seed germination, seedling establishment and survival in variable growing conditions (temperature, light and water). The objective-1 will be based on annually resolved tree-ring data covering the entire gradient. The distinct role of epigenetic changes on seedling growth and survival (objective-2) will be accomplished applying transplanting experiments with seed from long-term irrigated trees (13 years) and trees growing under natural dry conditions, in the field and in the laboratories of WSL, Switzerland.

The aim is to (1) evaluate the contaminant attenuation capacity of these mixtures for different conditions, (2) develop design guidelines to construct barriers for waste containment systems and similar applications, and (3) interpret their performance using numerical modelling tools. Column experiments where landfill leachate is passed through different waste:clay mixtures will be run in a state-of-the-art centrifuge facility which simulates realistic times, pressures and temperatures of landfill field conditions. The geochemistry of the column pore water and material residues after permeation with leachate will be examined to deduce the processes responsible for pollutant removal and retention. After permeation with landfill leachate, the effects of exposure of these barriers to an aggressive acid environment, rainfall infiltration and rising water table will be studied. The concept will be applicable for barrier design at other waste disposal facilities. The results will provide a novel and timely improvement which addresses the problem of managing the vast amounts of industrial residues such as FRA and BBA.

The autophagy-lysosome system is the major catabolic pathway dedicated to the recycling not only of protein aggregates but also lipids, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and defective or superfluous organelles, among others.  
 Appreciation of the role of autophagic pathways in the healthy and diseased brain continues to expand, as accumulating evidence indicates that proper regulation of autophagy is indispensable for neuronal integrity.  At the cellular level, several lines of evidence implicate autophagy in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. However, the synapse-specific substrates of autophagy remain elusive.  Similarly, the synaptic defects arising from autophagy impairment have never been thus far systematically addressed, yet they translate into severe behavioural deficiencies, such as compromised memory and cognition, pertinent to disorders of intellectual disability.
 The present proposal aims to determine how autophagy regulates synaptic plasticity and how its deregulation contributes to synaptic defects.  In particular, the objectives aim to: 1) Monitor and characterize the presence of the autophagic machinery in pre- and post-synaptic sites.  2) Identify autophagic substrates residing in synapses and whose turnover via autophagy determines synaptic plasticity.  3) Characterize the synaptic defects and ensuing behavioural deficits arising from impaired autophagy in the hippocampus. 4) Use C. elegans as a model system to address the evolutionary conservation of the synaptic role of autophagy and perform forward genetic screens to reveal novel regulators of autophagy in synapses.",2017-03-01,2022-02-28,1493750.0,,['recycling'],1,1
2045,752491,metabolicomp,Computational dynamics studies of drug metabolism by P450 enzymes,"Cytochrome P450 enzymes monitor the metabolism of many drugs and small-molecules, as well as selectively catalyze hydrocarbon substrates for application in biotechnology. Drug-drug interactions are critical to the management of safe and effective pharmaceutical treatments. Thus, it is important to better understand the biological functions and activities of P450 enzymes not only to maximize their clinical significance but also to develop broader application in other fields, such as biofuel. There has been significant investment in computational and theoretical studies of P450 enzymes; however, there remains a need for further dynamical calculations to better explore the involvement of the enzyme active site in competing pathways leading to various products. This project aims to determine the role of P450 enzyme in alcohol and alkene formations, compare and contrast heme and non-heme Fe-containing active sites, and model the effect of enzyme environment, using quantum mechanical calculations and inherent dynamics via quasi-classical simulation. The results from this study will help advance the field of computational modeling and its application in biologically important systems.",2017-06-21,2019-06-20,183454.8,,['biofuel'],1,1
2046,705982,ODICON-ASMA,Optimal Distributed Control and Application to Smart Grids,"The proposed action aims to support a promising young researcher so that he can move to an internationally active group and develop various skills. The proposed research concerns distributed control and smart grids. Distributed control is a topic of intense research and the available results are focused on stabilization while optimization in this setting is inherently difficult. Smart grids are an emergent technology for the efficient and robust integration of distributed generation sources and controlled loads. The proposed research aims to produce both theoretical results in distributed control and concrete control techniques for smart grids. Major issues to be investigated are heterogeneity and uncertainty as in practice not all subsystems are identical and their characteristics are a priori unknown. Therefore the controllers should learn the system, adapt to changes and take into account any differences among the subsystems. A goal of the proposed research is to provide globally optimal solutions. The importance of coordinating units will be investigated. These questions are both important for theory and relevant to smart grids. The problem of uncertainty will be addressed using techniques from estimation theory and system identification. The objective of global optimization will be addressed using global search methods. Both the hosting team and the young researcher have prior work closely related to the proposed research. Suitable dissemination and public outreach activities have been planned. Appropriateness of environment and supervisor are clearly documented in this proposal as well as the bi-directional transfer of knowledge. Instrumental is a three months secondment in a company specializing in smart grid solutions, where the researcher will have the opportunity to apply the developed techniques. This action will establish him as a mature and independent researcher and will provide him excellent career perspectives in the European academic sector.",2017-09-01,2019-08-31,159460.8,,['smart grid'],1,1
2047,734140,PJ27 IOPVLD,Flight Object Interoperability VLD Demonstration,"'One essential goal of the Single European Sky is to improve the Interoperability of the Air Traffic Management (ATM) network. The SESAR approach towards this goal is the introduction of a 4D-trajectory, which is common across all ATM stakeholders, called Reference Business Trajectory (RBT). The Flight Object concept is seen as a key enabler for implementing the RBT for Air Navigation Service Providers. The main objective of PJ27 is the demonstration that Flight Object Interoperability works in a real world upper En-route airspace environment of Air Traffic Control Centers (ACCs) from DFS, DSNA, ENAV and EUROCONTROL over spanning a large area of European core airspace. The demonstration will be executed as a set of Shadow Mode trials during which Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) will use Flight Object and SWIM equipped systems and perform flight coordination and transfer operations on the current air traffic as well as fallback operations. The only difference to real operations is that the ATCOs clearances will not be sent to the real aircraft. The project will assess the benefits of the Flight Object to improve ATM Network performance and situational awareness supporting demand and capacity balancing between and within the participating ACCs. The demonstration is expected to provide a proof that the Flight Object Concept is ready for deployment as required in the AF#5 of the PCP Regulation (EU) No 716/2014. This demonstration is an important milestone for Air Navigation Service Providers and the Network Manager, because it will constitute an ultimate step of validation before these stakeholders will start PCP AF#5 deployment activities. Finally the demonstration will provide valuable input into the SESAR Deployment Programme which will facilitate the coordination of PCP AF#5 deployment roadmaps and deployment scenarios.'",2016-11-01,2019-12-31,1233047.49,,['traffic management'],1,1
2048,727420,TC2D,2D nanomaterials-based composite films for more efficient thermal conduction,"The aim of this proposal is to determine the economic and technical feasibility of using readily scalable technologies for the development of inexpensive and high performance solutions for heat dissipation for the high-end automobile industry, as well as other markets including household appliances, injection moulding, advanced aircraft and pharmaceutical manufacturing, ranging from the actual fabrication protocols, down to a wide range of finite products. 
The technology here described is focussed to solving heat dissipation issues by the use of novel 2-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. While graphene is the most well-known 2D system, hundreds of other inorganic layered materials exist. 2-dimensional materials have immediate and far-reaching potential in several high-impact technological applications amongst which are heat harvesting and dissipation.
Our technology will offer very cheap, scalable solution of using advanced 2D nanomaterials for enhanced heat transport. Moreover, our technology offers the advantage of being extremely versatile: 2D nanomaterial dispersions can be sprayed on their own directly onto surfaces or they can be mixed to different matrixes such as Polysil to obtain enhanced resistance to wear, abrasion, oxidation etc. This will allow us to improve the performance of existing systems, as well as improve the performance of new designs. Our developed solutions will not need to be applied through the whole heat recovery system, but mainly at those critical parts that limit the system performance. This technology has the potential of becoming a feasible, easy and efficient solution for a range of manufacturing companies. It will constitute a huge economic return, not to consider the societal overall impact of having much more efficient ways to deal with energy consumption.",2016-12-01,2018-05-31,129773.75,,['nanomaterial'],1,1
2049,714177,ELECTRON4WATER,Three-dimensional nanoelectrochemical systems based on low-cost reduced graphene oxide: the next generation of water treatment systems,"The ever-increasing environmental input of toxic chemicals is rapidly deteriorating the health of our ecosystems and, above all, jeopardizing human health. Overcoming the challenge of water pollution requires novel water treatment technologies that are sustainable, robust and energy efficient. ELECTRON4WATER proposes a pioneering, chemical-free water purification technology: a three-dimensional (3D) nanoelectrochemical system equipped with low-cost reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based electrodes. Existing research on graphene-based electrodes has been focused on supercapacitor applications and synthesis of defect-free, superconductive graphene. I will, on the contrary, use the defective structure of RGO to induce the production of reactive oxygen species and enhance electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants. I will investigate for the first time the electrolysis reactions at 3D electrochemically polarized RGO-coated material, which offers high catalytic activity and high surface area available for electrolysis. This breakthrough approach in electrochemical reactor design is expected to greatly enhance the current efficiency and achieve complete removal of persistent contaminants and pathogens from water without using any chemicals, just by applying the current. Also, high capacitance of RGO-based material can enable further energy savings and allow using intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaic panels. These features make 3D nanoelectrochemical systems particularly interesting for distributed, small-scale applications. This project will aim at: i) designing the optimum RGO-based material for specific treatment goals, ii) mechanistic understanding of (electro)catalysis and (electro)sorption of persistent pollutants at RGO and electrochemically polarized RGO, iii) understanding the role of inorganic and organic matrix and recognizing potential process limitations, and iv) developing tailored, adaptable solutions for the treatment of contaminated water.",2017-05-01,2022-04-30,1493734.0,,['photovoltaic'],1,1
2050,694151,STAMP,Separation Technology for A Million Peaks,"Extremely high separation powers are required to fully characterize complex mixtures that are of crucial importance in many fields, such as life science (including systems biology), food science, renewable energy sources and feedstocks, and high-tech materials. The STAMP project is aimed at obtaining a peak capacity of one million in liquid-phase analytical separations. Spatial three-dimensional liquid chromatography will be used to achieve this goal. The major advantage of this technique is that all second-dimension separations and â€“ in a next step â€“ all third-dimension separations are performed in parallel. This allows high-resolution separations to be performed in each dimension, while the total analysis time remains reasonable. Optical and mass-spectrometric imaging techniques are envisaged as detection methods after printing (STAMPing) the effluent from the 3D separation body on a suitable substrate. The STAMP project also has a number of sub-targets that will bring additional significant benefits to all the above application fields.  

The target and the sub-targets of the STAMP project may be summarized as follows.
â€¢ Separations with a peak capacity of 1,000,000 (through the use of spatial 3D-LC)
â€¢ Fast and efficient spatial 2D-LC separations
â€¢ Devices for spatial 2D-LC and 3D-LC
â€¢ Detection principles for spatial 2D-LC and 3D-LC
â€¢ Suitable stationary-phase materials and mechanisms for orthogonal 2D and 3D separations
â€¢ Relevant applications of all of the above in various fields of science.",2016-09-01,2021-08-31,2499780.0,,['renewable energy'],1,1
2051,702755,DILIPHO,Diffusional limitations to C4 photosynthesis,"C4 plants are leading grain (maize, sorghum), sugar (sugarcane), and biofuel (miscanthus) producers. Their higher productivity potential arises from the operation of a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which is an effective â€˜turbochargerâ€™ of the assimilatory machinery. In recent years there has been a considerable drive towards engineering a CCM into C3 crops as a possible strategy to boost agricultural productivity. This emerged as an alternative strategy to the traditional breeding, which seem to be inadequate to ensure complete food and nutrient security in the face of global warming, population growth, and decreasing arable land availability. Advanced breeding of C4 plants is currently impinged on negatively by lack of knowledge of fundamental C4 physiology. This lack of fundamental knowledge calls for a  deeper understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of C4 photosynthesis and quantitative predictions of the effect of genetic manipulation.
For C4 photosynthesis to operate, a substantial flow of metabolites is continuously exchanged between two partially isolated compartments in the leaf parenchyma (mesophyll and bundle sheath). This project (DILIPHO) hypothesizes that under low turgor the exchange of metabolites slows down, thus jamming the C4 machinery. DILIPHO consists of three phases. Firstly, the applicant Chandra Bellasio will learn concepts of advanced Mathematics and Biophysics, and develop a mechanistic model to study metabolite transport at leaf level, DILIMOD. Secondly, the hypothesis will be experimentally tested. In the hypothesis will be experimentally tested. Thirdly, the model will be interrogated to mechanistically explain the dataset and to answer fundamental questions in C4 ecology and physiology. The findings and the theoretical tools that will be developed in DILIPHO are urgently needed, and have a notable potential to benefit advanced breeding, the economy and the society as a whole.",2017-09-01,2020-08-31,245440.8,,['biofuel'],1,1
