The overall goal is to identify how much funding goes to technologies of climate change mitigation.  

Mitigation of climate change means here a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks (= storage places) of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4). Examples: increase of energy efficiency, solar power, afforestation; and NOT preparing shorelines for flood or nature conservation (because this is adaptation to climate change).  

Technology means here a configuration of processes, knowledge and material that together fulfil a function. Examples: car, chair, wood carving, showering, planting crops; and NOT corn or public meeting.  

Examples of climate change mitigation technology: wind turbine blade, heat pump, food packaging, power plant, algae for energy generation; and NOT awareness campaign, general research network that is not tied to a specific technology, educational tool.  

1)	Read project objective (column L).
2)	Does the objective mention that the projectâ€™s outcomes would lead to mitigation of climate change (perhaps among other goals)? If yes, then go to step 3; if no, discard project.
3)	Reading the objective, is the project about (or is promised to lead to) a new or adjusted technology? If yes, then go to step 4; if no, discard project.
4)	Add project.
When in doubt, you can ask: can this project lead to developing or improving a technology that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions? If yes, then add.
