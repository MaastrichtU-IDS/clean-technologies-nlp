## Data Description
---

The study was carried out using Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebooks. The input and output data files are `csv` and `xls` formats.

### Requirenmetns
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

### CORDIS data

The original files can be found in the original EU Open Data Portal landing page. This data will always contain the last updated version: [H2020 programmes](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/cordisref-data/resource/9840dedb-5abb-4724-a72c-6be08d3413f8)

## Annotation guidelines `cordis-h2020projects.xlsx`

The overall goal is to identify how much funding goes to technologies of climate change mitigation.  

Mitigation of climate change means here a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks (= storage places) of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4). Examples: increase of energy efficiency, solar power, afforestation; and NOT preparing shorelines for flood or nature conservation (because this is adaptation to climate change).  

Technology means here a configuration of processes, knowledge and material that together fulfil a function. Examples: car, chair, wood carving, showering, planting crops; and NOT corn or public meeting.  

Examples of climate change mitigation technology: wind turbine blade, heat pump, food packaging, power plant, algae for energy generation; and NOT awareness campaign, general research network that is not tied to a specific technology, educational tool.  

1)	Read project objective (column L).
2)	Does the objective mention that the projectâ€™s outcomes would lead to mitigation of climate change (perhaps among other goals)? If yes, then go to step 3; if no, discard project.
3)	Reading the objective, is the project about (or is promised to lead to) a new or adjusted technology? If yes, then go to step 4; if no, discard project.
4)	Add project.
When in doubt, you can ask: can this project lead to developing or improving a technology that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions? If yes, then add.
